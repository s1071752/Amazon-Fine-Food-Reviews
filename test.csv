"I was looking for an easy and convenient way to add lean protein to my diet on my training days.  A friend suggested I try these, so I did.  They are really tasty!  The jerky strips are really yummy as well.  You will not be disappointed if you buy these.  They were also much cheaper than buying at a local ""health food"" store!"
"DO NOT be freaked out by the ostrich! This tastes exactly like a slim jim- it is shorter and fatter in size, but the flavor and texture are the same. You would never know you weren't eating 100% beef. Gave it to a few friends telling them it was a slim jim and they loved it. They had no idea it was anything but. I wanted a high protien snack that was not as fatty as a slim jim- they leave a gross oily residue in your mouth. This product is low fat, low carb, high in protein and tastes great (seriouly, just like a slim jim). *The Ostrim Natural has no nitrates."
"I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.  I'm not even half down with my first order and I already ordered a second batch.  This is just really good stuff, if you like beef jerky and beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  When you eat it the stick has a snap to it, tastes clean, not oily / greasy or fatty.  You taste just meat and before you know it you've eaten the whole thing and are thing about another."
"At only 80 calories these are a great bang for the ""caloric"" buck!<br />Low sugar, low fat, high protein!<br /><br />They taste like a pepperoni stick without the fat. Maybe a little on the dry side but not bad.<br /><br />I use them for protein after a workout ..."
"These are quite tasty and by far the leanest, highest protein you will find. Great price as well! They are twice as big as a Slim Jim too, just WAYYYY healthier :)"
"These are a flavorful, low fat, high protein snack.  They are, however, very dry so make sure you have a big glass of something to drink nearby."
"I love these things. They are easy and you get a good amount of lean protein. However, the last two shipments have been dry. This is in stark contrast to the juicy and fresh ones that I have been getting for quite some time. I'm disappointed, and thinking of discontinuing my orders."
"These things can be addictive!  I first tried these at a smoothie place but they were over $2 each.  I decided to check around and with like most things, Amazon had the best price.  I've ordered probably 6 or 7 times now.  People always want to try them too.  I'll be buying more."
"This jerky was recommended by my nutritionist because, unlike most jerky, it contains no sugar or other harmful additives. Tastes Great."
"This tastes nothing like a slim jim to me so for those that claim it does, either they haven't had one in a long while or their mind is tricking them.  Most of my friends get a whiff of it before they try it and turn it down.  I'm Asian and trust me half of our food doesn't look tasty or smell good, but is often very good.  I love these sticks.  I will admit they are probably going to be an acquired taste for some.  I've only bought the natural from amazon.  I tried some of the other flavors and found them a poor product.  Their additional flavors were in harsh contrast to the natural flavor of the ostrich meat so I can see how some would see it as a turn off.  My personal opinion though.<br /><br />Like a few other said, I don't like the inconsistency.  Sometimes the quality is good, sometimes not. I'm wondering if there are dips in the ostrich meat market where they have to sometimes use meat they normally wouldn't.  Or if they were left in bad conditions too long during transport.  If the saltiness and dryness were consistent each time, I'd be much happier."
"A pleasant change for the jerky I am used to. Low fat and low carb as well. So its Ostrich, but it does not taste weird like I thought it would. Actually, it tastes similar to beef."
I am a jerky snob as most are either too high in fat or have way too much seasoning on them. The natural flavor of Ostrim is healthy and tastes great. This is my second order and I will keep a steady flow of them coming in.
"Great taste, and high protein. These are my favorites! I wish they were a bit less expensive though. All high protein foods seem to cost an arm and a leg however."
This product is a great snack for anyone trying to stay on a low carb diet.  I like that the fat content is low and calories are on the low side as well
"Got to say when I bought these I was worried about the ostrich, not  going to lie.  When they arrived however they  tasted great, on top of that they're low in fat and great for protein.  This is the exact reason I bought them because I'm trying to lose the last few pounds while gaining muscle. The thing is though that I still think Jack Links tastes better.  Jack Links Slim Jims are high in fat however but on the other side there jerky is low in fat and on top of that around 20g of protein per pack. I gave this product a 5/5 because it was so low in calories and still tasted good but I will say when I finish off with this last bit of body fat then Ill probably switch over to Jack Links because the higher amount of protein. Still great product because it's healthier, 5/5 stars."
"I love these. In general, I like protein snacks. These are a leaner alternative to regular beef sticks. Good flavor and my favorite characteristic is that the sticks are not greasy at all."
"The purchase experience was great and went off without a hitch.  These snack sticks are convenient, delicious, and very satisfying!"
These jerky sticks are really good. They aren't fatty like most sticks and I really like the taste. I find I like these much better than typical beef jerky. The packaging and size are also great. I recommend these for anyone who likes jerky or is looking for a low-fat/high-protein snack-on-the-go.
"Very tasty treat for when we are on the go! Love the fact that it's instant protein in a pre-packaged, quick to grab serving size. I prefer these when they are slightly chilled but the kids seem to like even when they are at room temperature."
Even my daughters love the taste of these.  Their low-fat content and high protein count make them an awesome snack option.  One fills me up and stays with me for a few hours.  They are a healthy alternative to all of the other jerky/stick meat snacks.  They're also very portable.  Well worth the money!
"It's healthier than most meat snacks, and it is filling. Great for those moments that you are either too busy or too lazy to make a meal. The fact that it's individually wrapped allows you to always carry one with you. I leave some at work for when I get hungry or for when I am so busy that I don't have time for lunch. My favorite flavor is the original, followed by the peppered. This is also a great price per oz."
"I am really glad that I found the Ostrim snacks.  They have a nice meaty texture and are not oily like some of the other beef sticks out there.  I haven't tried the other flavors, but the natural is quite good.  I particularly like that they have 14 grams of protein.  Honestly, one stick and piece of fruit is a substantial ""snack"" that keeps you full for a while.  It's great that Amazon offers them on ship and save - - makes the price really affordable, too!  Try them, you'll like them!"
"Great quality meat sticks for a good price. These cost no more than a comarable size slim Jim and taste as good or better. The best part is the nutritional aspect. 80 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 14 grams protein and 300 grams of sodium. Great snack option to bump your protein intake."
I really enjoy this product. The taste is great and the texture is nice and chewy just like jerky should be.
I have these for an afternoon snack at work. Very tasty. Would compare the flavor to a Slim Jim but not as strong as a flavor. I have had the BBQ & Teriyaki. I like both of them.
Great protein snack that tastes better than any other beef stick I've ever had. I like this flavor better than the pepper or teriyaki.
"As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good ""healthy"" snack for when I have to have some jerky."
Great protein snack! I eat one pack before workout and one after...20 grams of protein and only 120 calories. Best of all....it takes great and is not the typical protein bar.<br />Love it!!
I just love these things. I decided to look on Amazon after having tried them at my local Smoothie King. It's much cheaper purchased through Amazon and tastes just as great! It's a great snack with only 80 calories and 1.5 grams of fat. I will definately be buying more. I love the 'Natural' flovared ones. I might try some of the other ones eventually but I really love this one :) Bye bye slim jims.....hellooooooo OS TRIM!!!!
Ostrim beef-ostrich jerky tastes great and isn't sweet like most jerkeys. It has only 60 calories and is very low in fat and carbs. It's delicious and excellent for a high-protein diet. The price is quite reasonable and it's a healthy snack or mini-meal. I've tried only the pepper variety and love it. I've ordered twice and will continue.
"High protein, low fat, and good taste.  I would like to see these with lower sodium, but overall they are one of the best snacks I have found yet."
"A little drier tasting than beef jerky sticks, and also more salty.  Very salty.  Someone else mentioned a gamey taste, I'd agree except that I didn't think it was too much.  I wouldn't like these if I wanted to eat them frequently, but I'm more like once a week or two.  Good for that, for me."
Hungry but can't cook? Eat this.<br />Hungry but want to snack lean? Eat this.<br />Protein intake currently low during the day and no protein powder or any other meat is around? Eat this.<br />Want to extend your daily 3 meals into 6-7 Meals a day to get your metabolism running and to burn more calories? Eat this as a mini meal + a protein shake/fruit.<br /><br />Do you need this? NO<br />Is this a good supplement for protein intake? YES<br />Convenient? Yes<br />Fatty? No<br />Salty? So-SO<br />Expensive? So-SO<br />Worth it? YES<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for emergency protein intake!
"Who would've thought a snack that is not bad for you, could taste so good.  Both my husband and I really enjoy these."
"The best healthy snack there is. When you crave that late night meat without the guilt this is the product for you. I took 3 with me on a trip with a vegetarian family and it gave me the peace of mind knowing I could get my meat/healthy fix. Love Love Love this product and the taste is amazing. My cats follow me around hoping I will drop a piece, which I do by accident :P"
"Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet. Require no refrigeration, easy to carry around, fairly easy to open. These sticks, at 1.5 oz., are larger than many similar products out there. One consideration- these are a bit higher in sodium than I would really like to see, though no higher than other similar products. The only problem I have had with these is eating too many! I have tried another flavor of these, and found the teriyaki flavor to be better."
"these are great, high protien low calories. so many jerkies now are high in calories these are only 80 cal's a stick. they are great for a snack or a meal on the run."
"this product is tasty, low calorie and high in protein. It is a little salty on the taste but that is probably because of the nature of being jerky."
"I work 12 hour shifts with only a 30 minute lunch. I bought these as a quick snack to hold me over until my next meal. They're great. They taste pretty good, low in calories (only 80 calories), and enough to hold you over for at least a couple of hours. They are also a good idea if you are going to work out and need to get something in your stomach, but don't want a whole meal. Quick and easy."
"I am so glad that I tried these. They are GREAT. No bad after taste, and no burping the spices up afterwards. VERY good, I will definitely be buying these again."
I Love these snacks!!  They're the best!  Especially if your a weight-loss surgery patient.  Will definitely continue to buy them!!
"Yummy taste. Nice texture. Super low in fat, high in protien. Not dry, not greasy, just tender and moist. Subtle flavor, not peppery."
"From what I can tell from the nutrition facts and ingrediants, these appear to be a pretty darn healthy snack. They aren't cheap but if you can afford them, they are an awesome snack."
"Unlike protein bars that are trying to be a candy bar, and unlike most meat sticks, Ostrim is low in fat AND carbs (especially sugar). It has also got a good amount of potassium, which I really appreciate. If your are not a vegan or vegetarian, you will find that these are a good tasting and uncompromising way to get high quality protein as a snack instead of some garbage at the convenience store. Despite delivering only 80 calories I find this snack to be a satisfying way to hold myself over between meals."
"I purchased an Ostrim High Protein Snack at a juice bar after the gym one day, because of its high protein/low carb/low fat properties, expecting it to taste like a stick of cardboard, and was surprised at how good it was. I purchased a second snack as a novelty item (Ostrich meat) for my teenager, who loves beef jerky, and was stunned when he thought it was delicious. I immediately ordered two cases of Ostrim from Amazon (MUCH cheaper than buying them retail), and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack. Who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great? Ostrim is AWESOME!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CU0N36"">Ostrim High Protein Snack, Beef & Ostrich, Natural Flavor, 1.5-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 20)</a>"
"These snack sticks pack lots of protein, have very little fat, and best of all, taste great.  They tide me over til the next mealtime, and I can feel good about eating them.  I've tried several flavors, and they're all very similar in taste, and they all taste kind of like Slim Jim's, except they are drier (less fat).  It's an easy, healthy way to incorporate more protein into your diet, without adding unwanted fat and calories."
"I love the fact that this product is not greasy.  I love the fact that I can throw it into my purse at the last minute on my way out the door to work and then later onto a night class at the university.  It keeps me from going crazy at the vending machines.  You do need lots of water.  It is a little twangy, I guess is the word I would use, but it tastes good.  I am so excited to have something with high protein and low fat that is so easily accessible.  Thank you."
"These snacks are great!  The natural flavor is a lot like the Slim Jims we ate as kids.  Only these are healthier!  Great to carry in purse to keep sugar from getting low while on the run.  Also, my job has me on my feet with no breaks!  It's easy to grab one and enjoy it to keep going.  Low in fat and calories but high in protein.  Forget that mid day sugary candy bar.  Grab on of these! A no-guilt snack!"
"These taste great, and are very low in fat compared to other beef sticks.  They are very low in calories, and most of the calories come from protein.  I have used these while hiking, and usually keep a few in my car for a healthy snack so I am not tempted to go get fast food."
These things are like crack. Seriously. I can't get enough. Forget about Slim Jims or regular beef jerky. These are the real deal. Great as a pre or post workout snack. I just wish they were cheaper so I could buy a year's supply right now!
I have to agree with the other reviewers! These are excellent and difficult to stop eating! I'm not even that fat and I want to eat the whole box in one sitting! What a great jerky snack!
"I bought the Ostrim while looking for a lower fat alternative to a Slim Jim. This is one of the best beef sticks that I have tasted. It is not oily or greasy like a Slim Jim.  It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it."
"Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg (which I am allergic to), I thought this would be a great snack.  It tasted awesome - but I read the label (my fault for not doing sooner) and saw it contains milk.  Would get 5 stars if I could eat it.  Ingredient list is missing from Amazon website, and that information would have been nice to know before I ordered.  However, at least the guys in the house love the taste."
"I got these because I don't usually like the grainy protein chocolate bars and these are better but high in salt.  My favorite flavor by far is bbq, it doesn't taste like bbq chips it takes like a mild slim jim.  The worst in my opinion in the teriyaki, basically because its too salty and not very sweet like you would want a teriyaki.  Original and pepper are ok but I actually look forward to eating a bbq"
"I bought these as an alternative to protein shakes, tuna, or cold cuts when I wanted a quick protein-based snack.<br /><br />I have only tried the Natural flavor.  They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful."
"I'm on a very very very strict diet, and these jerky sticks were recommended by a few people on the same diet. I can't praise them enough!!<br /><br />They're moist, really delicious, healthy, and filling! They're everything I needed, and I'm hooked. The price is fantastic, the ingredients are excellent, these sticks are a win win!  I can't wait to try the other varities (I bought the natrual flavor so far)."
"As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

"I've been doing the Dukan low carb diet, and these are the best snack I've found so far. They're lean, tasty, and good for you. If you're trying to do a low carb diet, or even just snacking healthier, these are a great addition to the pantry."
"Ostrim beef and ostrich snacks are pretty tasty. I expected them to be a bit spicier, but they are good as they are. I needed another protein snack to supplement protein shakes and protein bars. The whole ostrich thing piqued my curiosity so I bought them. They are convenient to carry in my pocket while at work and the price is right. I will almost surely buy more."
"High in protein, low in fat, not greasy but you know you're eating a meat snack.  Smoky flavor is pretty good but I find that about 3/4 of the way through I'm about done with it, it starts getting just a bit too dry and a bit too bbqy.  I've been breaking them in half and eating the other half later.  My dog was quite thrilled with it when I left it on the table.  After reading that it was the #1 sports nutrition meat snack on the label, my 7 year old son started requesting them for his school snack, then began asking for extras for his friends.  I wonder if there is a #2 sports nutrition meat snack?<br /><br />I use these and several similar products to boost my protein intake on days when I'm running a bit low.  Perfect as one of a handful of tools suitable for that purpose."
"I like this product a lot and I think they're very tasty, but SO SALTY. I'm one of those people who love a lot of salty foods and will always add salt to everything I eat, but even I think these are way too salty. Luckily I like them enough and the nutritional stats are great, so I'm going to stick with them. My only other complaint is I just got my second order and the outside of the stick is SO tough, like it's stale. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with the one box, but if it continues, I may have to cancel my order, as it was pretty bad."
"I like the taste and the satiation factor of the product.  The protein, calorie and fat ratios are near ideal.  And, did I mention convenience; convenient?  I've ordered these on the timely delivery program.  Also, I like the lack of greasiness feel to them.  I keep them stored in my freezer to ward off any mold problem that I've seen claimed (I do appreciate those comments for giving me a ""heads up"").  These are a great product that I recommend."
"Ok so I'm deployed and thought I would buy something odd as far as beef jerky.. Out of all the guys in my Troop, only 1 person liked the jerky. Its not bad, but its not good.."
I just received these a few days ago. Had my first one only minutes ago. Now I need to drink a gallon of water. a sing 42gram serving has 300mg of sodium . Texture and beef/ostrich flavor is fine but is hidden by the heavy handed use of salt. I wish I could return the product.
"These protein sticks have a very strong ""gamy"" flavor. It's hard to describe -- it's not sickening, but it is weird. Also, they are extremely dry. Having purchased them, I'll finish them, but I doubt I will buy them again.<br /><br />*Update* On second thought, I may have to throw these out. I've eaten them twice, and both times they caused me some moderate gastrointestinal distress."
"I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those."
"I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly! Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect."
I bought this to fit in with my high protein hig fiber low carb diet.  They do taste great and I would give them 5 stars if they didn't include the following: THis product contains SODIUM ERYTHORBATE and SODIUM NITRATES.  These 2 substances have awful side effects up to and including DNA damage...If they were all natural I would buy again but these substances are terrible for your health...If you don't believe me you should google both of them...If this does not concern you then by all means you should check them out as they taste pretty good but I won't be re-purchasing them any time soon...
"Maybe I should have picked up on the name ""Jerkee"" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says ""nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed"" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist ""jerkee.""  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand."
"saltyness may be the ""norm"" for products like this, but it doesnt mean i have to like it. its probably healthier than a ""slim-jim"", but i still wont order again because it contains lots of milligrams of unhealthy salt, and it tastes extremely salty. better have a gallon of water nearby to go with it,if you want to try eating these.i hope they can try making a lower sodium version of this some day.."
"SIX Reasons to buy this product:<br /><br />1. It's a healthy source of protein you can stash in your pocket.<br /><br />2. It's fun and cool - it's Ostrich!<br /><br />3. It's only 2 weight watchers points<br /><br />4. They say its a good source of potassium (650mg) and iron (?) - I'm not a nutritionist<br /><br />5. If you like salt. I have to say I don't, and Im a bit sad because I want to love this product, but it is too salty for my tastes.<br /><br />6. If you want to drink more water. Seriously these are salty."
I purchased this product once before from amazon and it was good.  Welll the last purchase of this product was bad.  The barbecue sticks were extremely dry and the taste was very poor.  I do like the product so I purchased from a bodybuilding supplements website and the quality difference was amazing very moist and tasty.  Will not buy this or any type of food product ever again from Amazon.
I read several reviews about this product and gave it a tried. I tried to like it but didn't work out for me after several bites even though I know it packed with great proteins and low calories. I'm just going to save it for emergency purposes but not for daily workout.
I was excited to get a healthy protein treat and I was hugely disappointed.  I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.
"Absolutely excellent coffee!! Joffreys has excellent flavor and choices! It comes in full 1 lb packages instead of the smaller ones that most companies make. I'm a 3rd generation native of Tampa, FL and was delighted to see that it is made in Tampa. I am a devoted buyer of Joffreys Coffee!!"""
We have over the last 10 years given our dog different kinds of dog treats. Rufus [dog] likes these the best.  Our grocery store stopped carring them. When we found them on line we got 10 bags so we wouldn't run out.<br /><br />Rufus thanks you.
"Do not buy at this price!  There are a dozen retailers, on line and brick and mortar, who sell Torani syrups for much less.  What a rip-off!"
Pretty nice taste to add to a green tea latte. It's pretty sweet so you have to be carefull how much you put it but it really livens up a latte.
"I thought this sauce was delicious and spicy and it comes in great big plastic jars, can put in many dishes, especially chicken enchiladas, etc...great size for a party."
"Well in Product Description it says this is for a 24 pack. Still a bad price. But wait, the shipping is $77.86???? Are you kidding me?????<br /><br />I gave this a 5 star rating ONLY because Coke is awesome."
This item gives no indication of quantity and it had better not be just one can at this price.
Yeah Coca Cola is good and all...but why the hell would you order a single can from Amazon? Only buy this if your a shut in and can't get anyone to go to the grocery store a block down the street from you.
"But if there's Slice, Pepsi, Sierra Mist/Sprite, Tahiitian Treat, Grape Soda or Dr. Pepper then it will ALWAYS take a backseat to the rest.<br /><br />To be honest, we haven't had Coke in our house more than 5x and we've lived here for over 11 years now!<br /><br />Art: B-<br />Taste: C+<br />Overall Satisfaction: C<br /><br />3.5 stars."
"One of our two finniky cats loved the little ""shredded wheat"" pillows. 50% in this case is excellent, since both had been repulsed by a half-dozen or more previous products (mainly the tube-lube genre).  Effective?  I planned on including the results in this initial review but decided a month was not long enough, so  the verdict on how well they work will have to wait another month.  Procedurally, however, I fed the one cat on both the regimens for existing hairballs and for preventing potential ones.  A month in and no hairball contributions.  I can, however, report now on my opinion of the manufacturer's customer service:  LOUSY:  I emailed a few questions relating to using the product most effectively and received no reply whatsoever.  If Amazon allows, I will update this review mid-November, 2011.<br /><br />UPDATE.  Two months in and no hairballs. Strange and amazing.  Strange in that M&C is just the usual petro-malt ""tube lube"" formula in a crispy coating. Even my ""non-picky"" cats do not ""prefer"" the tube-lube experience BUT yet they relish the M&C treats, even when broken open and the petro-malt is exposed. The secret is not in the coating, since I scraped some off and used as a flavor enhancer with no effect (See my CAT-MAN-DOO SPRINKLES REVIEW).  Amazing in that after the front-loaded dosage for existing hairballs, I cut back on the dosage even further than advised.  Instead of the recommended two ""pillows"" every other day I reduced that by half to one ""pillow"" every other day. And most of the time I would even skip weekends, which amounted to a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. This stretches the [65] ""pillows"" in the 50 g. package from two months to four months of servings and reduces the cost to a little over a dollar a month. NICE. Also nice is that M&C is available on Amazon, PetCo online, and PetCo stores for about the same price. The only thing better would be if our pets unanimously agreed on M&C as their preferred hairball treatment.  Unfortunately our pickiest pet has chosen another brand (VET*BEST CAT LUBE, reviewed separately). It works for her (so far) but I doubt the practicality of splitting the tablets of the VB product into small enough (effective) servings to make it as cost-effective as M&C; even if I ground the VB tablets into powder. But I probably will try. ONE FEEDING TIP: The 'pillows"" are fairly large and look more ""bite size"" if divided. THE ONLY NEGATIVE:  M&C still has LOUSY customer service: no response.<br /><br />LAST UPDATE: See my separate review of PET NATURALS HAIRBALL CHEWS for a summary of my experiences with all three products.  Hint: M&C comes out on top for value and PN for acceptance (and ingredient quality). M&C is now called HEALTHYBITES HAIRBALL REMEDY in a white instead of the metallic bag. And my apologies for the scattered information.  I would have preferred to review them all in one place but the separate trials extended over such a long period and I did not work out in advance a way of consolidating them into a neat package."
"I have a cat that has hyperthyroid disorder. Unfortunately, he does not like the Greenies Pill Pockets. He just eats around the pill and will spit the pill out. I found the Defurr-UM treats are perfect. He loves the crunchy texture. I break the treat in half and push the pill into the gooey middle. It helps to give a non-pill treat first, then the pill treat, and while he's eating the pill treat I give another non-pill treat under his nose on the floor to make sure he swallows his pill. Works like a charm every time. Plus Defurr-UM treats are cheaper than the pill pockets. It's a must have in my home."
"Fussy cat who benefits from hairball medications.  He takes these as treats and they help a great deal.  I give two per meal (twice a day) plus two as treats in the evening.  They have a crunchy outer shell.  Have not found a way to get gels into this cat.  I used to use product from Pounce, which they discontinued.  Pounce had soft shell and I could hide medicine inside them; can't do that with Defurr-UM.  Conversely, these work better, help much more with the hairball problems.  Recommended."
"(I started purchasing these ""good-for-them-treats"" at a local pet store when I adopted my first cat.  When they stopped carrying them, I had to start ordering via online.)  My cat is usually a picky eater- she's not big on anything ""human food"" related.  I was at first hesitant to give her these, seeing as I'm all about ingredients; and she usually won't eat anything new unless it smells like fish.  However, first scent smelled like a baked piece of chicken, and unlike the hairball pastes, she didn't seem to mind the malt flavor filling!  She chooses to eat theses first over any ""treat"" she's given (except a can of tuna fish ;)).  I think they're supposed to be ""crunchy"" on the outside, but the filling always makes them more ""soggy"".  I usually break one in half and give it to her every few days.  She is now almost 7 years old, and has only ever had a few hairballs in her lifetime. Giving these ever-so-often, a good dry food, and a brushing every other day during shedding season has saved us a lot of trouble."
I really don't know what the product is suppose to be like or if it works.  When we opened the package they didn't smell very appealing and our cat had zero interest in them.  The picture on the package indicates the centers should be soft and rather liquid.  When we cut one in half the ones we received seemed dried out and somewhat hollow in the middle.  It may be the package was old or defective.  We did not try to return them but just disposed of them.
"I purchased these about a week ago for my long-haired tuxedo.  The cons are the smell (the cat doesn't seem to mind, though) and the size.  My cat has a relatively large mouth and teeth but has trouble eating them.  Despite this, he loves them and is happy to eat more!  Most importantly, his random hacking noises and actual hairballs have stopped thus far.  In the past, I've tried hairball remedied food as well as some pastes that I've purchased from the vet (he hated those) and nothing has worked as quickly as these.  Highly recommended!"
"Kitty was very excited when she smelled the bag, and absolutely loved them.  Wish I had ordered more of them."
"These treats are great for my cat, Arthur who is the pickiest cat ever and they work!  I agree they are very expensive especially with the shipping charge but I'm from a small town so by the time I drive to buy them it's worth the price.  Would love to hear about any stores in SW MN that sell them cheaper.  Another trick I have found with hairballs is buying Purina One cat food for Sensitive Systems.  It's very reasonably priced, my cat loves it and it has really reduced the amount of fur balls on my carpet by a great deal!  Purina did not pay me to write this."
"My cat really likes this treat and I have noted a much shinier coat since she started taking these; more importantly, NO hairballs! She gets one every morning and reminds me to get her treat out too!!!"
My little girl thinks these are a treat. She purrs and purrs when I give her one. These definitely help her digestion as well.
"My cat is has medium length hair, but gets some crazy hairballs, and these are the only treats we use now. She just gets one at bedtime and begs for it, she loves it so much (and she is very picky.) The paste/gel stuff never worked, she hated it, so these are a great solution. If I ever run out, I'm in trouble because within a week she's got another hairball, so we make sure to always keep these on hand."
"Just bought these because I know my cat swallows and passes hair. She ate one thinking it was a normal treat, but that was the last one. She avoids them like fresh vegetables...."
My long-haired tuxedo kitty thinks these are the best! She gets a couple just before bedtime and will streak from anywhere in the house to get them when I call.
"Our Cat Tinkerbell loves cat treats (which cat does not?) and also has a problem with hair balls. Our veternerian recommended the Defurr-um treats. She likes them and has much less problems with her hair balls. Her coat looks better also. Sincerely, Means Johnston III"
"I bought this pack because i specifically wanted to try the NEW Cherry cola-well there was none in it!! I didn't realize it included the NEW Lime Cola which was a pleasant surprise as i wanted to try that one too. But this had 2 6 packs of LIME, 1 6 pack of Cola, and 1 6 pack of Caffeine Free Cola.  The flyer on the case showed it should have had the Cherry Cola as well.  Maybe it was just a one time mistake...."
My wife and I drink 4 per nigh while watching TV.  Delicious. Cherry Cola rocks. Caffeine-Free is great before bed.
"I will give it 10 stars and thank goodness that I've narrowed down the field to just the colas yet I also like the strawberry and the grape -<br />there is only so much room for storage although they do go quickly - best when chilled - it provides the ultimate soda refreshment - great contents as it should satisfy most about Zevia's ingredient aspects - again, simply the best in any flavors - a welcome find and dedicated customer writing a review for #1 favorite product line."
"This is the best soda without aspertame, or some other chemical sweetener that I have found. After I got off the diet cokes, I drank only water for a very long time. Its great to have something a little different again that is not unhealthy. Most of the flavors are pretty good. I buy whichever ones are on sale at the time."
"I love the clean, crisp taste of Zevia, and the Cola flavors have always been my favorite. The caffeine free Cola is probably the best in this pack for me, as I love having one with dinner, but do not like drinking caffeine after 4pm. The regular Cola is just as delicious, and its great for waking you up early in the morning or after lunch. Lime Cola is great as a cocktail, the lime flavor is just right, not too much not too little. The cherry cola is similiar to other cherry colas, but for some reason, though I like Cherry Coke Zero, I always give this to my husband, who is only too happy to drink it. ;) Great price, great flavors. I just cant resist this case of Zevia!"
"My dog loves these treats. If your dog doesn't like them, why would you offer them?  Hills is a great product."
"My 12 year old dog was never touched these treats... that is, until I had to put him on steroids (prednisone) and anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital) that made him ravenously hungry! Previous to his medications, he would turn up his nose to any of Science Diet's dry treats - they weren't palatable, were too hard and dry, and were hard to chew into. Now that he's on his medications, he'll eat them, but with no real zeal. He jumps and begs for other treats, but simply carries these dry, hard treats onto his bed, where he eats them at his leisure.<br /><br />So, if you have a chowhound who will eat anything, go for it. That said, if your dog has dental disease, I'd avoid them - these treats are so hard and crunch so loudly, I worry it actually hurts my dog's teeth to chew on these.<br /><br />My dog's review of this treats palatability: two thumbs down."
"The price is good for the amount, but our dog would barely eat it. Only way I could advise buying it is if you got a sample for your dog first and see if he or she liked it."
Our dog's stomache is a bit... sensitive... This is the only food so far that he eats happily and without unwanted tummy upset. It's a little bit of a high price but worth it for us.
All I know is my dog likes and the local Petsmart does not carry it.  So Amazon is where I found this available.  After much research on the web I found this dog food with a high rating.
"I have 3 adult German Shepherds, who were having some tummy problems about a year ago on the food that they were currently eating.  It was also Lamb and Rice, from another manufacturer.  My vet suggested we try Natural Balance because many of the other dog food manufacturers were upping the amount of grain in their mixtures to cut down on price and Natural Balance was grain free.  We've been on it for a year and the constant diarrhea is gone.  My dogs love it!  Sometimes for a treat I mix some of the bison and sweet potato in, they love that too.  Even better is that we can buy it from Amazon for less than Petco even if we pay tax and shipping.  Great deal."
I bought this same kit at another store (paid a lot less)and I had way too many issues.  The pre-made icing would not mix in the pouch.  When I finally did get it mixed the icing came out a dull white and was gritty.  The gingerbread pieces where curled so they didn't fit together correctly and the base that is included was flimsy.  I ended up throwing the house away and eating the wonka candy.  If you want to get a gingerbread kit for your family (and it is a fun family activity at the holidays) go with a different kit.
"FYI, Toys R Us has this gingerbread cottage for $9.99...that's the regular price, not the sale price.  Spending $28 plus shipping here is a rip-off!"
"Enjoyed, I bought using a kindle special offer and really became a fan of this tea. It brews a deep rich red, the mix reminds me of the English Christmas wassail but with more smoothness which comes from vanilla I think. Very nice for a cold and tastes wonderful esp. because their ingredients are so fresh."
"These are just basic M&M's so if you go to the store and look at the bags by the register, you are getting the same product. This just happens to be about 4 times the size for about 8 times the price. but i guess that's the price you pay for solid colors. That being said it is the same product, same flavor, same freshness as store shelves. one thing to consider when buying is your vendor. I purchased from M&M directly and got a nice bog with padding and a reusable cold pack. Maybe lost one or two to cracking. I ordered from a 'Free Shipping' vendor on Amazon and received half of each bag shattered and it arrived in a poorly padded envelope. At least it wasn't melted I guess.<br />Great product, if you like M&M's, somewhat market priced, nice gift/theme idea."
"Let's face it - if you're looking at this formula you've probably already decided to use it. Babies vary, but ours likes it fine made with room-temperature water.<br /><br />We've checked prices everywhere we could think of, and this with the ""Subscribe and Save"" discount is the best price we could find. But it's pretty close, so do your own homework; your local stores may have a different price than ours do.<br /><br />Baby's gonna drink a lot of this stuff."
"This is the way to purchase formula, buy in bulk and save.  I looked through all the local big box stores and grocery stores and most had a 23.4oz tub anywhere from $24.99-$26.99.  As an FYI, it does not come with a tub, it does however come with a couple extra scoops.  Here's a hint, take one of the extra scoops and mark it half way so you can make bottles with odd number of oz (1oz, 3oz, etc..).  Our newborn went through 4 of the 5 bags from Week 3 to Week 7."
"Enfamil was recommended by our pediatrician, we researched and settled on feeding our newborn this formula, our little one wants more of it all the time. Price is OK and the convenience of subscribe & save make this Amazon offering attractive. Thinking of joining Amazon Mom for diaper discounts too."
"If you don't want or can't breastfeed, I highly recommend starting with this formula. My little one loves it and he has had no problems with gas. My pediatrician also recommends this formula. He says it is the ""Mercedes Benz of formula brands"".<br /><br />I would also like to comment on the convenience of ordering this 5 Pack set. For my 3 month old it is a little more than a one month supply. I think Amazon does a great job in packaging it as well."
"My baby loved this formula from the beginning.  I was unable to produce enough breast milk for him but with the help of this formula I was able to keep him healthy and growing.  We had minimal issues with gas and he didn't mind the taste.  Also, buying this package of 5 refill packs was truly helpful.  I never felt as if I was running low on formula, which as a new mommy, you want to avoid any and as much stress as possible."
"Can't beat the price, and having a month's worth shipped to my door is so convenient.  Less stress, and more time to spend with my baby."
"First off - that photo is misleading, it shows you a BOX of formula leading one to think you're getting five boxes of them. Not true. Bought at a store, the box will have two packs and if you buy this item, they will send you five of those packs and not five of those boxes. Second - simple math. Five packs = 2 1/2 boxes. One box of formula at a store is about $30 (conservative estimate). Therefore, you're paying $114 for something that'll cost you at most $80 if bought at a store. Where's the savings??<br /><br />I admit it, I did not read through the fine print and like a chump ordered the five pack congratulating myself on such a great deal. It's not a deal, it's overpriced formula and I'm kicking myself for buying it. Shop around. Walmart sells four boxes for about $135. THAT is a deal."
i have been using this for years and every one i knows wants to know whats in it. i tell them its my little secret. best stuff ever!
"I have two vines producing passion fruit in my yard, and can't seem to get enough of the stuff. I was excited to find this syrup until I actually tasted it. The syrup tastes fine, but very little like passion fruit. The strongest flavor note is pear, with a vaguely tropical flavor underneath. Decent, but not at all what I expected."
For anyone who love's trance you have to own this album it's as simple as that.The first time i listened to it at a friend's house by the time the 3rd track was over i was sold and had to own a copy i never get tired of it i could listen to it over and over and over again it's that good so good i also bought the Live in Toyko dvd as well and went to see them in Cape Town (a 13-14 hour drive) when they came to South Africa.
"I was first introduced to Son Kite back in 2000. I was going through my psycho trance phase and decided to give this group a go after a native of Sweden recommended the duo. So I did, but I had a very bad migraine that night and learned that headaches and trance are not a happy union. The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music."
"I am a sucker for all things crunchy and these are some of my favorite crackers. They are not fat or very salty and are USDA organic. They are very thin and go with everything from peanut butter to cheese. I love the kick from all the different seeds they have, like anise. I snack on them all the time!"
"I have used catnip spray for many years. I generally put it on new scratching posts that I want the cats to use and I renew the spray from time to time just to keep them acclimated to the use of the posts and not the curtains. When toys are no longer interesting, a bit of spray livens them up. If the cats are bored, I spray the toy of the moment and that  gets kitty minds off the mischievious and back onto the game at hand.<br />I noticed that the bottle of spray that I had been using had lost its ability to interest, and it IS about 5 years old, so I decided to get a new bottle and naturally turned to Amazon as the easiest source for my need. I was dismayed to note that many of the sprays for sale had gotten bad reviews. Writers had stated that this or that spray smelled bad, or did not work, OR Smelled bad and sent the cat away instead of providing entertainment. So I carefully looked through the availability of various sprays and settled on this one.<br />It is made by a reputable company that specializes in products made from naturally grown herbs.<br />When the spray arrived, I first used it on a cat scratching product that had been a favorite, but had lapsed into disuse. After carefully spraying it, I waited a few seconds (literally) and here came my grey kitty with huge dilated pupils. He looked at me briefly and plunged right in and began rolling, playing and scratching. Then the shyer girl tiptoed over to see what the fun was and joined in.<br />So that I could get into the fun fest, I sprayed ""Da Birds"" (one for each cat) and hung the birds just out of reach of the kitties. Here they came and the games began. We played for about 15 minutes.<br />So I am well pleased with this products and so are my kitters.It was just what I had in mind. As usual with catnip spray, I can detect no odor, though I believe some people can smell a bit a a minty fragrance.<br />I certainly recommend this product as ""The catnip spray to use!"""
"My kitties love catnip so I've tried many products over the years. This product is the best! You can use as little or as much as you want, without huge bags with dried catnip, which lose its flavor rather quickly.<br />Just spray a little on the kitty's favorite toy and watch her having fun with it! Just make sure not to spray on your hands or the kitty will be *very* friendly with you for a while.<br /><br />I always spray the same toy at the same place to be consistent. One of my kitties (the smart gray tubby) asks for it! She leads me to her bed (where the toy is), lies next to it and meows. Then I spray the toy and she dutifully starts purring, licking it and generally going bunkers.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
"I've tried several brands with several cats over the years and this is the best.  It's worth the money! Shipping was quick and it arrived on time, couldn't be happier!"
"OK, So I bought the SmartyKat CatnipMist because it received a couple of decent reviews and it was one tenth the cost of ""From the Field"" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator. Well, you know what they say, ""If it's too good to be true, it is too good to be true.""<br /><br />SmartyKat CatnipMist just didn't work with my two cats. They sniffed it and then just walked away. They weren't remotely interested.<br /><br />But, ""From the Field"" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator REALLY does work. My cats love it. They sniff it, they hang around it, they roll in it, they wrestle and play with each other. That's what catnip is supposed to do. The only downside (but, it wasn't worth giving the product 4 stars instead of five stars) is that From the Field is costly. Well, you know what they also say...""You get what you pay for.""<br /><br />My cats don't care what it costs. They're CATS! I'll stick with ""From the Field"" Catnip Essential Oil Rejuvenator."
"This is powerful stuff!  My cats really enjoy this, better than regular catnip, stronger than catnip spray you get at a local pet store! One of my cats does not like fresh catnip, she likes it after it has been out of the package a while, but she LOVES this stuff.  It lasts, cats are going after places I sprayed this on days after I sprayed it.  A must have if your cats like catnip!"
"Like one of the other reviewers, I bought this because it was the only spray that seemed to have any really good reviews.  Let me tell you that this stuff REALLY works.  As soon as I spray it on her scratching posts or kitty condo, my cat starts going crazy!  Tonight she actually started to lick the scratching post after I sprayed it (not really the desired effect, but an indication of how much she loves the spray).  While 1 oz doesn't seem like a lot, it seems like it will go far if you're not spraying it daily.  I'm not sure yet how long the scent lingers, but the initial spray gets quite a crazy cat reaction.  Highly recommended if you want a spray to attract your cat to a particular area in your house."
"I don't own any cats but I got this for my friends cats (who I think are awesome). The cat nip they normally use was getting a bit old and wasn't working as well as it used to. I wanted to get the kitties something nice for Christmas, so I looked on YouTube and saw some videos for cat nip spray. It looked like it worked pretty well on the videos.<br /><br />After looking at reviews for other products, I was hesitant. This was the only 5 star product and despite there being only 2 reviews I decided to take a chance. I am glad to say this product did not disappoint.<br /><br />As soon as I recieved the spray I pumped it a couple of times to prime it and I sprayed it ONCE on accident. No big deal, right? Litterally, one minute later: here come the kitties from the other room. THEY LOVED IT! I don't think I have ever seen them this playful on ONE ACCIDENTAL spray.<br /><br />I sprayed a couple of new toys that I also purchased through AMAZON. Again, one pump was plenty and they went nuts yet again! I wish I had taken a video of it to put up on here. I would definately purchase this product again. If you love to crack out your kitty then look no further. You will not be disappointed."
"WOW. All of the craziness with none of the mess of the herb form. My moms cats and my cats went bonkers over it. Love that I don't get catnip trailed all throughout the house as well. Makes it very easy to refresh cat toys or beds. I think I'd better not ever run out of this product, or my cats might throw fits. They can't get enough!"
"Catnip doesn't affect all cats the same.  Mine, a mother and her two daughters, all seem to be immune to the effects.  The product smells strong so I am assuming it would work well for other cats.  I will give it away and hope some other cats will enjoy it."
My cats love this stuff. I'll spray it on something and they will go crazy. It also got one of them actually using the scratch post they had been avoiding for some reason. The only problem is it completely wears off within a day. I pretty much expected that... so not really an issue. Just don't buy this if you want something that will last. Really I can't imagine any spray that would.
"I have a very old cat and a new kitty and they both LOVE this product...I spray it on their scratching posts and toys and watch the fun.<br />It has saved my leather furniture and soooo much neater than the messy catnip in bags...this spray lasts a long time, definately would by again"
"My three cats come running as soon as they hear the ""spritz"" of the catnip on their toys.  And they love it.... until it dries.... and then the attraction goes away - quickly.  Too bad, because ""it's good while it lasts"" it just doesn't last very long.  I've tried a heavier spray, but with the same result.  So, I'll keep looking for something that provides a little longer ""high"" for them."
We originally bought this flour to make pizza which made EXCELLENT crust!! Also made excellent bread in my bread machine- worth the price-- esp in bulk like this
The Antimo Caputo 00 Tipo Chef's flour is really wonderful! What a differece this 00 flour makes compared to all purpose flour when making pizza dough. Everyone thought the pizzas I made were soooo good! Taylor's Market had super fast shipping and the 00 flour was packaged securely. I will buy from Taylor's Market again. Very Pleased!
"The perfect flour for wood fired pizza. It might not work as well in a kitchen oven since it tends to NOT brown unless the heat is very high(800+ degrees F) In that case mix with up to 50% bread flour and you will get that brown crust. This flour makes a lighter almost puffy dough that stretches well. With the addition of bread flour, the dough is a little chewier and will brown at lower temperatures.My family loves the texture and flavor using this new dough in my standard recipes. I am still experimenting with additions, Like BF, for texture and flavor."
"The Antimo Caputo Superfine Farina Flour is a great product.  The flour is perfect for pizzas and foccacias, makes the crumb very fine and tasty.  Hard to believe that the finer grind makes so much difference.  I love it."
"If you make pizza dough yourself you have to use ""00"" flour.  This finely ground flour makes the dough and is worth the extra amount spent!!"
"Caputo Flour is it for making thin crust pizza.<br /><br />67% hydration, ferment minimum overnight, and presto."
"Ordering some more today - it's the perfect pizza flour, what a difference!  Great price, great deal on shipping.  Who would order from anywhere else?"
This flour makes amazing pizzas and bread. It's the first time I buy it and I plan to continue buying it!
"My grandson wanted a lizard birthday cake this year.  I had every intention of actually hand-piping a big lizard on the cake.  I purchased these gummy geckos as party favors, but when I saw them I decided to use them on the cake.  I used several to form a big ""6"" on the cake; I got such a kick out of them that I decided to use them as cake borders as well.  All I did was use icing to add eyes to each gecko - very cute.  I had plenty left over for favors, and even have a few to give out for Halloween.  A fun purchase that went a long way.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, the kids loved the sour flavor!"
This was sent as a gift. The recipient reports great pleasure from these soups. I am pleased.
This fine powder sugar is both necessary and good to work with when making Christmas Cookie parties due to their beauty.g special cookies such as Japanese Kaigashi. The recipes for this confection are hard to find but well worth the effort. Everyone is WOWed at
"This arrived quickly and in good condition. I'm in Europe and although sugar is plentiful here, I haven't found powdered sugar to be as fine as the American brand, so am happy to have this for icing, etc."
"When this first came out, I actually used it by heating up water in the in-room coffeemaker while in a hotel room while I was on a week-end vacation. The vacation was extra-special, and every time I sipped a cup it brought back warm memories of a special weekend. I kept it in my cupboard and treasured it for stress-filled days.<br /><br />Sadly, when I moved, I was no longer able to find this particular blend, and I have missed it desperately. So now, with my ""pack of 6"" I am set for winter AND a lot of wonderful memories. OR, if I need more, I can always re-order ... and re-order ... and re-order. :-)<br /><br />If you have never had it, there is a distinct Cinnamon flavor mixed in with the chocolate, which gives it both a unique scent (ummmm), and a gentle flavor of cinnamon mixed in with the mocha flavoring. If this sounds tasty to you, it will be, but if you want a plain mocha flavoring, this won't be your cup of cappuccino.<br /><br />My vote - 5 stars."
"the most great tasting instant cafe mocha ive tried, especially the hawaiian mocha and cinnamon mocha. its great hot with a little whip creme or cold on a hot day. if you love coffee try this one you will enjoy."
"I originally tried Caffe D'Vita's jumbo cappucinno can available at Costco and loved it but when I moved out of California found my local Costco in Sequim, WA didn't carry it.  Frantically I tried the Costco suggestion box to no avail so I went to the Caffe D'Vita web site and ordered direct from the manufacturer!  The price is higher in 16OZ canisters but there are several more flavors to choose from including Cinnamon Mocha, Hawaiian Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, Mint Chocolate, Chocolate Rasberry, Amaretto and Orange Mocha.  There are a few other flavors but I don't recommend them due to personnal tastes.  In any event Caffe D'Vita is a terrific alternative and better value compared to the french vanilla cans you see in most grocery and box super stores.<br /><br />My favorites are Hawaiian Mocha, Cinnamon Mocha and the Cappucino."
"I'm a big fan of the Mocha Cappaccino, in fact I'm addicted.  I thought I'd try a different flavor this time around and it was a big mistake.  I do not recommend Cinnamon Mocha Cappuccino!"
This is a must for making Mai-Tai's though many good liquor stores that i went to had never heard of it.  definitly try it!
"You'll need this if you want to make a real Mai Tai (Bob Chin's) anyway. They shipped this super fast and it arrived exactly on the day it was needed. It is a staple of any good mixer collection. Great price, excellent customer service and communication."
"Torani Orgeat Syrup is an ingredient used in making the perfect Mai Tai.  I've rarely been able to find it in a store and was pleased to find it available through Amazon.  Ordering was easy and the package arrived well protected, within a week."
Product was used in a drink recipe and unavailable locally.  The price was right and the service was fast and efficient.
I haven't tried the syrup as it is to make Mai Tai's with but it did arrive very quickly. Great service!!
Amazon messed up somewhere along the line. I was sent the wrong product. I could have made the best Mai Tai's ever but we'll never know...I can't get a replacement until AFTER my party.
"I was hoping for something full of flavor but not bitter.  I got the ""not bitter"" with this tea, but it's not very strong.  Certainly very drinkable, but not what I was looking for.  Also tried the same company's English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast teas.  I felt the same way about them."
"I've tried several whole wheat spaghetti pastas, and this is by far the best. I decided to try it because it was USDA organic, which is a big plus.  In my experience, it is more difficult to get that perfect 'al dente' texture from whole wheat pasta.  However, this product has cooked perfectly every time.  The 12 individual bags are easier to store, too."
My family loves these Crackers!  They taste great and even my 2 year old finishes his cracker.<br />There is just the right amount of cheese in the middle.<br />Will buy this product again
"These taste like inexpensive cracker and ""cheese"" packs.  Actually the inexpensive packs taste and handle better than these do.  These consist of two bland, sturdy (i.e., hard) rectangular crackers with a bland soft filling.  So when you bite into them, the cracker parts snap into shards and the soft filling is squished out of the sides from the pressure of biting.  They aren't even filling, not nearly as much as one of those cheap packets are.  I really felt like this was one of the worst rip-off product concepts I'd fallen for in quite a while.  It's all excessive packaging and marketing nonsense."
"I liked these so much I bought a case.<br />I highly recommend these for anyone who likes cheese crackers.<br />Gunner June, 2012"
"Looks high quality and tastes that way too. Pairs well with grapes or wine for a nice, reasonably healthy snack. Amazon's subscribe and save price is comparable to the grocery store's."
"I wrote the review below just over a month ago; my purpose tonight was to come online and set up a monthly order for the product, at a reduced price, as advertised in a recent e-mail. Imagine my horror in finding tonight that the price of the product has almost doubled. I am so disappointed.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />This is a fairly new product. I life in a rural town and although we have a couple of big stores, one variety, one grocery, they seem to never have this product on the shelves. There are different flavors, but this is my favorite, and must be a lot of other people's favorites too.  What I love is the fact that I can get this terrific product, at a comparable price, and have it delivered right to my door. No frustration.<br /><br />The product itself makes a healthy, fiber filled snack or even a light lunch.<br /><br />Ritz has done well, but this is the most popular flavor of crackerfuls, so they need to make sure the stores have more of this particular type.<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON.com for providing me this way to order this great product."
"I'm rating this a very neutral three stars - because it's just a warning that Amazon has these reviews scrambled. This item is supposed to be the Omaha Steaks 1lb Snow Crab Cocktail Claws. Before you rate the reviewers down for posting to the wrong product (i.e. crab cakes, shrimp cakes, or seafood-stuffed mushrooms), try to post a reply to one of the reviews, then look at the picture of the product reviewed. You'll see that the reviewers actually reviewed the correct products - but Amazon scrambled the reviews for three different products here."
"These stuffed mushrooms arrived with no cooking directions attached.  (I purchase frozen food online from another retailer---everything comes with cooking directions, times, etc...I am used to superior products.)  I perused the original site online for the proper cooking directions, then followed them to the letter.  First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage."
"We received these Omaha Steaks brand Coconut shrimp as a gift. I like coconut is some preparations (pina coladas, certain cookies), but I don't eat it as a snack. I enjoy the scent of natural coconut.<br /><br />Though these shrimp are edible, the coconut aroma and subsequent taste overpower anything else. Even from the oven, the only thing that I can smell is coconut. When eaten, they leave a strong aftertaste that for a while makes one wonder if by mistake you consumed a coconut-scented wax candle by mistake. This holds true even when drenched with cocktail sauce to try to drown out the coconut.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that the overpowering odor is natural coconut, which I find to be pleasant. One of the listed ingredients is ""Artificial Flavor,"" which likely means that Omaha Steaks attempted to ""enhance"" the flavor in some way. Unfortunately, I can't tolerate the resulting smell, which is an integral part of the perceived flavor when eaten.<br /><br />In short, if you're a huge coconut fan, or if your sense of smell is inoperative, then these might be for you. If you are an occasional consumer of coconut, then proceed with great caution."
"The scallops were ok,but not JUMBO...more like mediums sized,but tasty none the less<br />From the description,we expected huge scallops...instead,they were average.<br />Woul not order again!"
"Cooking directions should be included with the description.  These are ""pan fry only.""  I thought they could be baked.  I ASSUMED, which was wrong.  I'm giving these to the neighbor."
I love these shrimp cakes. At first I did not know how to cook them. So I kind of ruined two of them. But my mother cooked them perfectly. Delicious. Just pan fry it. Do not add too much oil. You can just spray olive oil on the pan and fry each side few minutes.
"I purchased these mushrooms as a gift and cooked them according to the directions for the Superbowl party.  Although the flavor was good, the mushrooms were soggy and the sauce that comes with them was very fatty.  I will not purchase these again."
"There is a lot of cola syrups trying to be Coke but this one is shooting for Pepsi. It comes close to Pepsi but of course not a bull eye just like cola syrups can't be Coke, both Coke and Pepsi own the recipes for their drinks. Now that said this is  a very good tasting syrup and not a hard or sweet taste like other cola syrups but more mild flavor. My sister is a big Pepsi drinker and she likes this lot more that other cola syrups, she doesn't like Coke. I think we will be sticking with, it seems this is the only syrup trying to be like Pepsi. Again got the package in great shape and very fast, just wish the shipping could be lower. So if you're not a Coke drinker and want a syrup more like Pepsi, you found it!"
My order was received very fast and in excellent condition.  The product tasted fantastic.  Would shop here again in the future.
"This product is fabulous. It contains ingredients that my blender would not get fine enough for me to be able to tolerate in my morning smoothie. I do drink this on its on on occasion but usually use it as a base with some ice cubes or frozen fruit because I drink a smoothie made out of frozen fruit every morning and enjoy the cold drink. It contains spirulina, chlorella and blue-green algae all of which would have to be purchased desperately plus if you look at all the fruit in one bottle you really are getting  a bargain...but not for this amazon price. I buy this same 1 gallon container at my local Costco warehouse store for $5.99.<br /><br />So to sum it up great product but buy it at Costco or have it special ordered by your grocery store, most of them will do it if you buy 2-6 at a time."
Amazon is ripping everyone off... this is only $5.99 for the same 64 oz at Costco! All your necessary fruits and veggies mixed into one and it tastes yummy. I think the fruits over power the veggies so it doesn't taste like you're drinking broccoli.
I LOVE Naked Juice.<br />The first time I tried Green Machine I think I plugged my nose lol.<br />Then I actually put aside the fact that it looks like liquid boogers and actually tastes awesome.<br />I'm not a big fruit or veggie eater and I know this probably isn't as good as eating the real thing but it works great for me.<br />Just be aware one bottle has as many calories as a 16oz bottle of soda. I use mine as a lunch replacement.<br />Recommended.
"But the actual taste is fantastic. I usually don't drink a large amount each time because it leans toward high price size, but it's well worth the money. It contains a balanced nutrients from both fruits and vegetables.<br />I like its taste, but the last bottle I purchases had a slight change of taste, which was a similar taste I disliked from a similar product of another brand. It's fine the taste change slightly because it means the smoothie truly uses fresh vegetables and fruits, which do have changes of tastes from time to time. However, I hope the new taste doesn't last long."
"I LOVE this juice!  I think it's delicious, with a fruity flavor that is great either on its own, or blended with more fruit/ice for a thicker consistency (this product is a bit thin).  Green Machine is naturally sweet, 100% juice, and my family and I love the way it tastes.  It may not be the prettiest smoothie on the block, but don't let that deter you from trying it, because its looks don't affect its flavor!<br /><br />I do agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this price is pretty high compared to where I shop, so making price comparisons may find a less expensive option for you.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product!"
"I love this stuff! I can't describe the taste but it is vaguely like pineapple and I don't know if someone who doesn't like pineapple would like it or not but if you do it is the most delicious thing ever and you get a who ton of healthy vitamins and stuff, and it has like spinach and kelp and blue algae and all sorts of horrid stuff I would never eat. The only thing I don't like about it is that you should only drink 8oz a day otherwise you might O.D. on vitamins or something."
"This makes a great smoothie or is just a great glass of juice.  The best part is no added sugar.  The looks would make you think twice about drinking it, but the taste would make you think twice about why you haven't been drinking it forever.  Great product."
This is a great gum and it does curb  craving for good. However It is not that cheap here (amazon does gaurentees the lowest prices or used to..). I can get it 1.19 per pack from my local grocery store (Market Basket). Here it is 1.36/pack even when you buy in bulk.
I've used this product many times so I already knew that it was a great product.  It will curb your appetite so that you don't snack between planned meals.  The only problem is that it no longer seems to be available from my local stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!
"I used to buy this regularly from CVS. It worked so well that I lost 60lbs one summer. That's 10lbs a MONTH people! I also exercised heavily (2-3 hours a day) and ate a meal bar for every lunch, so the gum didn't help me LOSE weight, but it did keep me from pigging out after all that exercise. ALWAYS eat a healthy (small) breakfast and a regular (preferably home cooked) dinner in order to safely lose weight and keep it off."
"This gum is great! It is very healthy for you and it helps to raise the PH level in your mouth. Thus fighting cavities and other nasty germs. I chew 2 pieces at a time per the recommendation on the box. I find that it has the right amount of kick and the flavor lasts longer then I ever want to chew it, which is + 2 hours.<br /><br />Simply put, buy it over any other gum."
Excellent product.  Great for people<br />that wear dentures as it doesn't stick.  Flavor lasts.  Also works well curbing hunger. A little pricey but worth the money.
"The Bionaturae Bilberry Nectar is a really effective health product, which my friends in an engineering group have proven (to ourselves) to greatly improve night vision, and eye health in general.  Two of the engineers have diabetes and have had inter-ocular bleeding prior to beginning the use of bilberry.  Subsequently, we have had no incidents.  In fact, the Army Air Force used bilberry and carrot juices during WWII to improve pilot's night vision.  That having  been said, the single star is directed at either the ad writing, or the blatant greed evinced by the price.  Nearly $28 plus shipping would be a fair price for a six-pack, but nowhere did I read that the item for which that price was  being asked was, in fact, a six-pack.  Hence, the drop from 5 stars to 1 star."

"Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!"
"This oil is far superior to Spanish or Italian olive oils and to many Greek. A First Cold Pressing, there are no additives or preservatives so the oil has a light, clean taste. I use it extensively in salads and over pasta dishes.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the quality of this product."
"This is by far my favourite olive oil. I used it in a restaurant i worked in, and loved it so much, i started getting it at home. It's fruity and perfect for salad dressing, bread dipping and finishing on you pasta/scrambled eggs/anything! I always cook with it too, and it's beautiful when making pestos. We go through the big tin quite quickly as we use it so liberally! It's great value at this price. GET IT."
"This is by far the best olive oil I've had.  I first tried it with bread in a local Italian cafe and I really liked the flavor so we asked the server for the brand name.  I don't know how to describe it, I think it's more on the fruity rather than peppery side.  I can't find it in my local grocery store, fortunately, I can get it from Amazon."
"The ingredients are listed below (taken from the product package and website):<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Certified USDA Organic<br />Certified Kosher<br />80 gm (2.8 oz) of Spice in a Reusable Tin<br />4 out of 5 Heat (according to their website)<br /><br />Paprika, Black Pepper, Coriander, Nutmeg, Ginger, Ajwain, Allspice, Birdseye Chili, Fenugreek, Cardamom, Clove, Himalayan Pink Salt, Onion, Garlic<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Now I thought about making my own blend, but decided that it would be easier to purchase an already blended amount rather than worrying about the measurements and also sourcing Ajwain (which is similar to caraway).  The blend does seem paprika heavy, but that's okay.  I've tasted it just plain, and it does have a decent heat as well as a paprika/ginger/nutmeg thing going on.  The other spices all add little nuances here and there.  It's not too strong, so just a pinch on your tongue is enough to taste without the spices overwhelming.<br /><br />I've been using this blend for East African dishes (vegan in my case), and I am extremely happy with the results.  I made an Ethiopian Chickpea stew from the ""Everyday Happy Herbivore"" cookbook and it blew me away.  I did put in 3 1/2 teaspoons (the recipe said to start with 1 and go up to 4).<br /><br />The heat level is pleasant without being explosive.  I would say it's a nice and even burn.  It's not quite as hot as, say, Sambal, but it is surely hotter than most commercial 'hot' salsas.<br /><br />But after researching, I found that there are many variations on this blend, many with extremely rare and local East African spices, others with cumin or cardamon or nutmeg.  The spices that seem to be in common are fenugreek, ginger, black pepper, chili pepper (of some sort), and allspice.  Most had paprika.  So despite my not having had a huge variety of these blends, I cannot vouch for the authenticity, but it seems in line with most variations I have noted.  It seems that the big faux pas is putting turmeric and cumin in the same blend.  Luckily this brand does not.<br /><br />One could make their own blend of these spices, but it's a lot easier to grab a good sized tin from this company, and be happy that it is certified USDA organic.  And tasty too!  And 2.8 oz. is actually a decent amount for $10.  Especially since I couldn't find it locally anywhere, even at Whole Foods.  Great for a little exotic heat in your dishes."
We ordered the berbere directly from the teenytinyspice company and were very pleased.  It arrived only 4 days after I ordered it and came with several different recipe cards.  There was also a free spice sample.  The berbere blend was incredible in a Doro Wat recipe we took from a Washington Post article from 2010 about the spice.  Yum!
"After reading about this spice blend in Eating Well magazine, I purchased a tin.  I can't say enough about, not only the spice itself, but the company who makes it.  The packaging was excellent, many recipes cards were included in the order along with additional sample blends.  I ordered this product directly through teenytinyspice, so I don't know what the packing is like through Amazon, but even if the bonuses are not included with the Amazon order, the Berbere blend itself is well worth the money."
"This spice is out of this world.  We are blown away.  Well done, Teeny Tiny Spice Company.  We just bought one more of the Ethiopian spice along with two other blends."
"I was expecting a hot honey peanut but got a honey peanut with a slight chipolte flavor not in the least bit hot. They were good but just not what I was expecting thus the 2 star rating. If you are looking for a good, slightly different flavored honey peanut then this is for you. But if you want it to be in the least little bit hot or spicy then this is not for you."
Kalvert Rose Syrup exceeded my expectations for flavor and aroma.  I use it in ice cream and in to sweeten some teas.
"Sent as a gift, an old time favorite- My friend LOVES them.  Expensive (good price on amazon but still expensive) but worth it.<br /><br />Love Amazon- fast and reliable- always"
"My dog loves Sam Yams Sweet Potato Chews.  It's a healthy and enjoyable treat for her to chew on.<br />No rawhide material in the recipe, just healthy ingredients."
"My greyhound seems to like these a lot, and they don't give her loose stool (which plenty of things do).  Great healthy ingredients -- besides being grain free which is all I'll buy, I love the lack of additives or dubious ingredients.  This will be a repeater for me -- well it is already, as I got my first batch at a fancy pet food store I was visiting and came to Amazon to get more (for much less!)."
"I've offered them to my dog repeatedly and only once has he even taken one in his mouth. He immediately laid it on the floor and never went back to it. Admittedly, he is very picky about his treats. My friend's dog isn't interested in them either."
"I'm amazed! This was, by far, the best carrot cake I ever ate. Didn't expect too much since it came in the mail and it was the first time I ordered from Omaha Steaks. Well honey, I , as well as my son and best friend, loved it!!! I'm going to order some more....."
I bought this pasta because as a diabetic I am interested on lower my glycemic index and I really enjoy eating pasta.  It tastes great- no real difference in flavor from regular pasta- cooks in the same amount of time and the pasta water is great for thickening the sauce.<br /><br /> My only negative comment is the order I received has a few small beetles in it- I froze all the pasta to kill them but still occasionally find one floating in the pasta water that I have to pluck out.  Apparently pasta is a common way for them to enter the house as pasta is never heated when it is made- just dried/cut and boxed.
"This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)! It is important to test your blood sugar to be sure you react the same way.<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
great low carb spaghetti. There is virtually no difference in taste from regular pasta and with the timed reorder it comes out cheaper.
"I buy Dreamfields pastas because I am diabetic and have to eat very low carb to control my blood sugar and my weight. Before Dreamfields our choice of dishes was very limited.  Now, with Dreamfields, I can make all those dishes that call for pasta.  Dreamfields lives up to its claim of low carbs because my blood sugar doesn't skyrocket like it does with regular pastas.  It' a bit more expensive than plain pasta, but it's worth it!"
"this company uses boxes that leads you to believe you are getting a pound of pasta like other companies but you only get 13 some ounces. I noticed when opening up their boxes how little pasta is inside. I bought a whole bunch of this stuff, different styles that were all in standard size packaging that most companies provide a lb of pasta to realize they mislead you into thinking you are getting a lb.<br />The stuff is not cheap to begin with. I truly wonder with a company that is misleading if their claims of 5 digestable grams of carbs is true. They can say whatever they want as this stuff is not FDA regulated."
Baked several of thier mixes in their machine and it will not rise.  Sadly all were yucky.  I was hoping for a real bread like product.  I could not recommend this to anyone.
"It's a good substitute for cheese sauce.  It's not fake tasting and has real ingredients.  Sure it's good with chips, but I like it on other things- baked potatoes, omlets, broccoli, burritos.  It's a good product for those looking to cut out saturated fat from their diet."
"I've bought all sizes, shapes and scents, and this is my hands-down favorite candle. The aroma is crisp and clean without being soapy, fragrant without being overpoweringly floral. It's just refreshing and calming, and strong enough to clear cooking smells from a kitchen. My only complaint is that it only comes in green, which doesn't match my house..."
"Good Tasting, not to sweet, just right. Almonds are slightly ground up, making the easier to chew; for older folk."
"I have been buying this at Publix Grocery store for years. All of a sudden it's not there. I now find ""diet"" Cran-Raspberry which has 110 per 8 oz. and it does not tastes as good."
"I tried this several months ago and found it to be an over-priced complete disappointment. I love acai and used to eat the pulps & purees all the time when I lived in Brazil. This is not a good acai product. First, it is stored at room temperature. What a joke. Acai should be maintained frozen to preserve the nutrients..at times refrigeration is okay, but room temp for a fruit product stored for several months...not a good deal. Anyone in Brazil knows this. Second, they claim to use the whole fruit including the seed. This is false marketing. The seeds are used to burn for fuel and composted for fertilizer in Brazil. Nobody uses the seeds for dietary consumption. Finally, this product treats acai as a dietary supplement. Acai is a fruit, a whole food. It is not intended to be served in 1oz serving sizes. Again, you would get laughed at in Brazil if you wanted a 1oz serving of acai. Like asking for 3 blueberries. Don't buy the Genesis Today hype. Very disappointed in all of their products. You're better off looking for some frozen acai pulp or frozen acai puree and eating a normal fruit serving of a few ounces."
"My dermatologist diagnosed me with psoriasis several years ago.  I tried prescription and non-prescription treatments, and nothing would completely clear my skin.  At that time, I had the psoriasis on the bottoms of my feet only.  I finally decided to give Mona Vie a try, figuring I had nothing to lose but a few dollars.  Within a few weeks of drinking one to two ounces per day, my skin cleared completely up.  I had heard stories like that, but I didn't really believe the hype, so I was pretty surprised and pleased.  When I stopped drinking Mona Vie, the psoriasis came back.  Mona Vie is very expensive, so I gave it up for a while and just suffered with the skin condition until the patches on my lower leg showed up.  After suffering for several months (while the patches got larger), I finally decided to order some Mona Vie.  I found the Acai100 while searching on Amazon, and I decided to give it a shot since (1) It is pure acai berry (Mona Vie is mixed with other fruits/juices), and (2) It's a bit cheaper.  I've only been drinking this stuff for FOUR DAYS, and the psoriasis is almost completely gone from the bottoms of my feet, and it's about 50 percent cleared up on my lower leg (and the itching is completely gone).  I am completely shocked and couldn't be happier.  I know I sound like a commercial, but I can't help it.  I am really amazed.  As others have said, this stuff tastes terrible, but I just hold my breath and chug an ounce or two.  For me, it is well worth the bad taste."
"I bought this at the health food store.  My initial thought was ""This had better be a great product if they have the nerve to charge forty bucks for a bottle of juice!""  I like the fact that I paid for unadulterated acai, and not for a ""blend"" that includes a lot of stuff I can get at the grocery store at $3 for 64oz.  If you're paying the premium for acai, be sure you're actually getting acai!<br /><br />On its own this juice is thick and bland, but not offensive.<br /><br />Mixed with some sugar-free lemonade, acai juice is very pleasant and I didn't lose out on any of the wholesome goodness.<br /><br />I drank this when I kicked off my eating-right-exercising-regularly behavior two months ago, and I believe the nutrients in this juice were helpful in giving me energy and getting me off to a great start.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this product, and because of my experience with it I recently bought (from other companies) acai berry air freshener spray and acai berry diffuser reeds and even a cologne that has acai scent in it!  I'd drink this product even if it weren't healthy/therapeutic."
"I purchased this product after trying everything to lose weight. I just happen to find an ad for cleansing and Acai berry weight loss things.  So I searched in Amazon for something. I've only had it for two weeks and haven't weighed myself so I can't say how much I've lost.  But I can tell you that I've completely lost my hunger for food.  I'm 90-100lbs overweight.  I love food especially fast food because cooking is not fun for me.  It is not uncommon for me to eat fast food at the very least once a day.  I didn't notice the first two days but day three I was debating what to eat for dinner and realized I couldnt decide which fast food place I wanted to drive though because I wasn't even hungry or craving anything to decide.  Then the next day it happened again, and the next.  Today is Sunday and usually the weekends I just want to eat everything because I have nothing else to do but watch tv and eat out of boredom or for flavor.  I now actually have to tell myself to eat. Believe me, I LOVE food.  I eat for flavor.  Now suddenly I don't even care to eat.  Maybe its mental but I've never not been hungry.  So after going nearly all day without wanting to eat.  Crazy, I know, I finaly made up my mind to go get a chicken sandwich from BK.  I made it half way and actualy put the other half down.  Never in my life have I stopped eating at the first sign of fullness.  Thats just a small part of my weight issues.  I have to clean the plate. Thats when I knew I had to write a review.  I drank it plain and its not that bad.  But I suggest drinking it with orange juice.  I don't even notice it.  It doesn't change the flavor at all.  Just the color of the orange juice changes a bit.  I still can't believe I didnt eat the whole dang sandwhich.  As for will it help lose weight?  I guess if it surpresses appetite, you eat less, therefore less calorie consumption.  And if you excercise thats just more bonus.  We'll see."
"I've learned that one should never take a juice product that has been processed into a capsule, powder or things like that because you're losing valuable nutrients. Genesis Today's Aça&iacute; is the only liquid, thick and real Aça&iacute; juice available today. I'm really glad to have found it, the nutrients value are very high and the taste is very refreshing. Highly recommended."
"This stuff is supposed to be great for many things, energy, losing weight, gaining muscle, helps to sleep, etc...  And it does work, but the taste is awful.  You can't taste it when you mix it in with some things, but drinking it straight is not recommended.  I love the effect this stuff has on my body, but my taste buds will not allow me to drink it anymore.  I recommend this mostly to people who can mix it in with protein drinks, maybe certain coffee's, or whatever that has a strong flavor that can cancel the ""flavor"" of this stuff.  I don't drink a wide variety of liquids so I could only mix it with one or two things."
"Since using acai supplements the cramps and tightness in my knee and palm disappeared. I started with some other acai juice product at the beginning but nothing could compare to Acai100 100% Acai Berry Jice Pulp Supplement. Soon after start I felt unbelievable changes in my muscle tone. Doctor told me I would never run again, but after one month I was back running with no pain at all. My palm was so tight with ligaments almost closing my fist completely, and that bared me from gym for a long while. I do push ups again. This product is just perfect: tasty and powerful.<br />It arrived well protected and packed in only two days."
"I really loved the results that this gave me. The Acai Berry100 juice by Genesis is extremely thick, not watered down at all. It is not your typical tasting juice though. It is not sugared up or watered down, it is the real deal. So the taste is somewhat unigue, a bit getting use to I guess, but the results are amazing! The thickness is exactly what people are looking for. You can tell it is what they claim it is. I've seen other Acai Berry liguids claiming that they are 100% Acai Berry, but the liguid is so watery & watered down. I took this product along with Green Kamut & I got some awesome results, lost several lbs. I enjoy taking it with cold apple juice. I continue to take it & absolutely love it! Would definitely recommend to others."
"I really like Acai 100 juice. It really does make me feel more energized and gives me an overall good feeling. I actually do not mind the taste either, I mix it w/ grape juice or really any other juice that was in the fridge. I do think it is pricey though so I am currently debating if I will place another order. I ordered it because I wanted to see if it would help with weight loss and curb my appetite which it did not at all. However, it did give me increased energy so I was able to go a little longer on walks and exercising which did help me lose a few pounds. If price is not an issue, I would recommend using Acai 100."
"This is really a good product made by genesis. and it helps me to reduce weight. I'm giving this five stars for the fact that it seems to be processed properly, it certainly has no added sugars, and it came really quickly from the supplier. It does NOT taste like a berry or it's not sweet or yummy."
My doctor recommended I use acai juice and this is the brand I prefer because it's 100% acai. I do feel my health has improved as a result of using it daily.
Acai 100 was recommended to me by my cousin.  The day after I started drinking Acai 100 my skin was glowing.  It is very palatable mixed with apple juice.  I drink 1 oz in the morning and 1 oz when I get home from work.  So far so good!
"Pricey but it's a great product and worth it to me. Of all the different formats Acai comes in, powder, pill, diluted drink, and pure concentrate, this is the way to go."
"I was skeptical at first because a few of my friends were really pushing me towards Monavie, but I could not afford $140.00 a month (or cheaper if I could get people to sign up under me).  Monavie will not state how much of the acai berry is in each bottle, so I decided to find an alternative.  This was the best I could find, and affordable as well.  Didn't see results the first couple of weeks, talked to a sales associate who suggested to increase the dose to 2 oz. per serving (I mix with V8).  That made a very noticable improvement in how I felt and was just starting to see a difference in curbing my appetite, then I ran out.  At my local health food store, found the same product for about the same price."
I'm recovering from 5 months of chemotherapy and wanted something to help boost my immune system.  Acai100 has helped my immune system to return to normal and given me more energy  The juice is full of pulp and I mix it with orange juice to give it more flavor.
"I am very happy with this product thus far. To date I have been taking for 3 weeks. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin, it feels so soft and looks bright and clear. Confirmed by my husband and friends. I am down 5 lbs but I can't say at this point if this is due to using this product. I can say that when I started the product my energy level was a lot higher the first week and has leveled out a bit since. I stopped taking the product later in the day because of this. Overall I am very pleased. I may try the freeze dried version next time to compare results but I like the idea of taking the berry in as purest form as possible. The product I received was a thick pulpy juice, tasted fine with a little grape juice added to sweeten."
"I first contacted this company by email prior to placing an order and was astounded to receive a full and friendly reply within minutes. I still had one question which I had forgotten to ask so sent another email. I mentioned that I might not see the response for a while as had to take my dog to the vet as she was an elderly dog and was sick. When I returned from vet not only had my question been answered, but also found a nice note showing concern for my pet. I placed an order a few days later and was quite impressed that the Acai arrived ahead of schedule and was packed perfectly ... these are glass bottles so that's an important point. The product itself is actually quite tasty and seems to really work as described. My wife has showed a marked improvement in her circulation and energy level. Its hard to describe what it does exactly, but I feel much better since I started my ""start the morning"" ounce routine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Naturally Vibrant Health is a company you can trust to give you a good customer service experience in a businesslike and caring, personal manner. I would not hesitate to do business with them again. In fact, we will become regular repeat customers. Oh, Meisje, (the dog, a 14 year old vizsla) is doing much better ... thanks for asking!<br /><br />Harold (Roanoke, VA)"
"This is the very first Acai product I used and continue to use today. Although sometimes I used Amazon Thunder. After a very extensive research on the many products available in the market I narrowed it down to Genesis Today. This is a very pure, thick mascerated pulp.No added sugar nor water. Not the best tasting acai product, but since you drink 1 to 3 ounces at a time is not bad ( use a shot glass ). I started drinking Acai for the anti-inflammatory properties and it works wonderful. It took away the huge pain I had in my hip area that I could barely get up in the morning. Tip: if the taste bothers you too much, mix it in a glass with organic grape juice."
"This Acai liquid form is what you want if you want to lose a pound or two each week & look much better in your clothes. Give up any pill type of Acai - this is what you want. You'll save a lot of Money in the long run & get results closer to what you've heard about. I've tried various Acai products for 5 months now - they don't hold a candle to this one. Personally you'll notice the weight loss more on your body than you will see on the scales. It really gets that gut fat - All my friends & family noticed & complimented on how much healthier I looked. And, I hate to argue with them. So in short - Acai works very slightly in pill form & really works in liquid - three capfulls in a glass of calorie free juice twice a day. You'll see results you're happy with."
"DO NOT listen to naysayers, like people peddling their own products on here! (Mona What?) This product is definitely the real McCoy. Thickest I've seen around, and the taste, while not sweet, is not unpleasureable. The only thing I can liken it too, for myself, is the no-salt version of V-8 juice, and even more pleasant than that.<br />I have drank it straight, and also mixed it with Genesis Today Acai Juice thats sold at Wal-Mart. Excellent combination. The jury is still out on effects, as I have only taken it two days so far, but I am definitely not limiting myself to one ounce a day!!!<br />Thanks Genesis for caring about my health!!!!!"
I have been using this for about six months now.  My niece sent me the first bottle.  I have cancer and it does make me feel better.  I  am very crefu  never to miss it in the morning.  It makes it easier to start my day.  Delivery is prompt and so well packer.
"this product is not the miracle that the acia berry is reported to be by some companys. this product does work! it curbs appetite, increases energy and leaves a pretty purple glow to your teeth."
"We were skeptical about taking an ounce of this juice a day.  However, once refrigerated- it was quite tolerable.  If in doubt, add an ounce to other fruit juices or smoothies.  My grandmother, husband, and myself started taking this about a month ago.  We're hooked.  It's helped our indigestion, bowel movements, and has given us an overall feeling of well-being.  I can't explain it, but when you purchase this juice- be sure to listen to the CD that goes with it.  It's very informative.<br /><br />Oh, and if you suffer from allergies/sinus problems like myself, you will find that this juice seems to keep my suffering to a minimal.  Sounds too good to be true, huh?  Well...we're going to continue taking it.  It's been good for us."
"I have tried at least 3 other brands making what they claim ""Pure Acai Berry Juices"".  I take my hat off to Genesis Today's product - it, by far, tops all others I have tried.  Great product, great benefit, definitely worth the money."
I've been taking this product for about a year now and I feel healthier and more energetic than ever. And for this price it was a great deal.
This magic potion made me spit all the nasty gunk from my throat from smoking (mucus)<br />It made me detoxify my body at a rate better than the other antioxidant level berries. great energy from it as well
"this product has done wonders for my hair and fingernails, and thru amazon it is alot cheaper than the natural foods stores"
"Just what I was looking for.  Pure, unsweetened or adulteruated with a bunch of juice I didn't want.  Keeps well in the fridge.  Typical of Acai berries, it has solids and not a sweet taste.  I mix it with my morning orange or apple juice.  Makes the color weird, but cuts the sweet of the juices."
"I am only 39 and I have had a problem with my energy levels for the past few years.  They thought I had Lupas, blood disorders, etc.  Anyways, I started taking this and a liver cleanse at the same time and I now have energy to clean, exercise, play with the kids, quilt, etc.  I used to sleep for 10 hours and still feel horrible.  After starting this, I can sleep for 7 hours and feel ready to go.  I have no idea how it works, but I love it.  This purchase was actually for my mother but she just started taking it so I don't know if it is having the same effect on her."
There was no bubble wrap around the bottles- they were just rolling around inside the large box.  Only a few air pillows were in there.- lucky they didn't break
This was brought for my husband who drinks an ounce or two every morning.  I purchased two bottles and they went bad before he finished them.
"This product is good, but expensive. I would like to see it on sale once in a while.<br />Good quality, would recommend."
"If this was pure, 100% Acai it would have to be refrigerated or frozen. If it is not it means the vial fats which contain most of the good nutrients of Acai, like the Omegas have been taken out. Because of the healthy fat PURE Acai goes rancid rapidly if not refrigerated. The only true Acai I have found is a brand called Sambazon. They are also the leading provider of Acai in the nation and you don't pay these ridiculous prices either."
"This is the first time I have tried this product, am not sure if it has improved my health as of yet. The taste is alright, it is better mixed with fruit juice, otherwise bitter tasting on it's own. I will continue to use this product in hopes that it will improve my overall health."
"Since we drink a lot of coffee I decided to try this product. I use a bit of cream and sugar or Splenda in my coffee, while my wife uses cream only. She didn't mind that there was some sweetness in this product.<br /><br />PROs:<br />-- Easy to use<br />-- Tastes great and much better than powdered creamer (even Coffe-Mate)<br />-- Just enough sweetness to make my coffee taste good.<br /><br />CONs:<br />-- Container size is too large for casual coffee drinkers<br />-- Pump tends to clog after 1/2 to 2/3rds of a container<br />-- One-way screw top for pump keeps you from rinsing or cleaning clogs<br /><br />I read most of the reviews here before buying this product. Because of info in the reviews, prior to starting use I modified the container top so I could take the pump off, if necessary for cleaning. As it turns out, about half way through the container, the pump started clogging. After cleaning with hot water, the pump worked all the way through to the end of the bottle.<br /><br />I would be more likely to purchase this product regularly if it was available in a smaller size, or if the pump could be removed for cleaning out clogs.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this product and will probably buy it again in the future."
"I like this creamer a lot. Tastes good, and it's good for speeding things up a tiny bit in the morning. However, if you don't use this thing a lot (at least I think that's the issue) then it clogs up and it's nigh impossible to get the creamer out. Bummer! I don't think I'll buy this again, just for that reason alone. Though, I guess I could buy it and just place it in a container of my own to prevent the issue....."
"I've tried both Coffee-Mate creamer pumps in both Hazelnut and French Vanilla varieties as well as the original. We use them for convenience at our office as well as at my church. The creamer itself is approximately equivalent to what you get in the individual flavored cups you find at gas stations and some restaurants. It's nowhere near as good as the fresh stuff you get at your grocery store. Each pump is supposed to be equal to one mini-tub but I don't think it is quite as potent personally.<br /><br />The main issue with these pumps aside from a compromise on taste is the poor quality of the pumps themselves. They frequently fail while the canister still has several inches of creamer still in it. Because of the nature of condensed creamer (thick and sticky) using the last 15-20% of the tub becomes tedious and messy. You either have to waste some of the creamer or sacrifice the convenience of of the pump--which is the main selling point to begin with.<br /><br />We still use these pumps because there is no readily available alternative, but for my personal coffee I stay away from them and go for fresh creamer whenever possible."
"I love this product!It tastes great in my coffee.Just noticed the price almost quadrupled in a week!WTF?????I bought this on Amazon(2 bottles for $13.00)about a week ago (01/30/12)and now it's $40.00?What gives with these prices?I am not amused.Gee,I should invest in this stuff,gold and Skylander's figures."
"Last time I bought this product it was 2/10 at the cost of $24.72 from Amazon but now in May 2010 the price is $30.77? Why such a big price increase? Now Amazon is more expensive then most other retailers? This is weird as Amazon usually has the lowest prices? Sams Club the cost is $9.88 each so 2 would be $19.76. Come on Amazon, for such a popular product on Amazon....lower the price and make sure you have plenty of stock on hand!<br />By the way....the product is great but the pump tends to clog so don't tighten the cap too tight so you can later remove it and rinse it with hot water to remove the clog."
"Discovered this at a hotel breakfast buffet, and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I've always used the refrigerated versions of Coffeemate creams, but for some reason sweetened original is not an option.  The nice part about this cream is that you can taste the coffee rather than the flavoring of the cream.  I can't drink coffee ""black"", so this is the closest I can get to enjoying the coffee itself.  It's A LOT of cream to have on-hand, but it keeps well, especially since it does not require refrigeration."
"i was a little unsure if i would like this creamer. i was WRONG,its a slightly sweet creamer.i find it to be very appealing to my taste!"
"I bought this thinking I could eliminate the liquid creamer I buy from the store and save money.  However because its sweetened, the people in my house pump until it tastes the way they want it to instead of pumping for the cream and adding sugar like we did with the liquid coffee mate.  All in all, we almost used the whole bottle within a week.  (Between 3 adults, we probably drink about 12 cups of coffee a day.)<br /><br />Like the other reviewers have stated, when the bottle gets close to the end, there is quite a bit left and you can't get it out without cutting open the bottle and pouring it in the coffee or transferring it into another container. That SUCKS!<br />I have not had an issue with the pump getting stuck...Probably because we use it every day.<br /><br />Other Comments:  The creamer came with a tip on it that points the stream of cream downward (not pictured with the bottle.)  I still have to do some testing however I'm not sure if 1 pump with the tip equals 1 liquid creamer cup as pictured on the bottle.  I do know that three pumps with the tip on it equals 1 tablespoon, so I'm able to get an accurate calorie count. (Unless you at ¾'s way down the bottle and the pump won't pump out.)  I also need to figure out if at all there are any cost savings compared to just buying the big bottle of liquid creamer and using sweetner.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it again for the following reasons:  Taste great, quick, easy calorie counting, and no refrigeration needed so my coffee stays hot."
"Fast delivery.  Best price.  I love this product.  It just sits on the counter for use all day. No refrigeration needed.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YUOWVO"">Coffee-mate Coffee Creamer, Sweetened Original, 1.5-Liter Pump Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>"
"I love this stuff.  It makes any coffee the best.  I first tried it at one of the local casinos and had never been able to find it anywhere.  I even wrote the Nestle company to find where I could buy it.  It seems it's not available for retail sales.  It's available through commercial vendors for office type businesses or places like a casino that have beverage counters.  I'm glad I thought to look for it here on Amazon.  This is a great product and although it's pricey once shipping is added, it's well worth the cost for that great cup of coffee I can now enjoy."
This is perfect for flavored coffees because a flavored creamer will sometimes 'not go' well with the coffee. this way i get just the right amount of sweetness and creamer and no competing flavor. Delightfully surprised at $13 for 2 - 1.5 Lt. bottles.
MY WIFE LIKES HER COFFEE WITH ONE SQUIRT OF COFFEE-MATE. THIS MAKES MY LIFE A LOT EASIER.NO MORE TRYING TO GUESS THE AMOUNT OF UNSWEETEN COFFEE-MATE AND SUGAR TO USE.
"No more messes with separate sugar and creamer spills, no struggling for space in the office refrigerator, no measuring, and IT TASTES GREAT!! I've not had any problems with the pump clogging up, and I just put the item on subscription so I don't run out. And, at Amazon's low price, it's even better."
"We never have any trouble with the pump, it is a bit difficult to push down but never clogs up."
"Pumped (3x right sweetness for me) Coffee-Mate before brewing k-cup, no stirring needed, no messy pouring or opening tiny cups of creamer. Pump clogged twice before I use the second bottle. How do you prevent pump from clogging?"
"This is a wonderful product if you don't order it in the warmer months.  I've found that ordering when it's warm causes leakage in the bottles and they have to be returned and/or refunded.  Other than that, the flavor is great, the convenience can't be beat and they last for an awfully long time."
The price here on Amazon is totally ridiculous! You can get it much cheaper on [...] is the least expensive ($14!) if you have a membership. I don't understand what in the world Amazon is thinking with this price!
"I have used International Delight's (ID) hazelnut coffee pods for years but balked at the fact that they forced me to use more creamer than I wanted (how do you save a 1/2 pod at work) and the cheapest price I could find was at Publix.<br /><br />I bought this huge pump bottle of Coffee Mate hazelnut creamer at Sam's Club for less than $15 and figured I'd just put it out at the communal coffee pot if I didn't like it.<br /><br />Turns out I actually like the creamer better than ID's and one pump of the stuff is the perfect amount, less white and less sweet than a full pod of ID's.  I also like that it has less than half the saturated fat of ID's creamer and I'm using less. If it truly provides 300 pumps, it'll also cost me 1/2 as much as the individual pods.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it really can't compete with the taste of real cream."
"My husband does like cream in his coffee but hated to take it out of the refrigerator and did not like to open the little creamers by the coffeemaker as it was too much of a hassle and just drank his coffee black until I discovered this when visiting my daughter...he loves it and it is great to leave it on the counter.  It has just the right amount of sweetness for him but others like to add a bit of sweetener to it to taste.  Too bad it went up in price but you do get 2 of them and I haven't found them anywhere else to buy, so we usually keep one and give one to our other daughter who lives locally.  It's really great for the summer not having to worry about spoilage like I do with real cream."
"we love this stuff, easy to use pump, very good taste, saves time in the morning. good product."
"This coffee creamer is great.  Never over-sweeten your coffee again.  Makes the perfect cup of coffee.  Lasts and lasts.  A little goes a long way. If you like your coffee Boston style,  you will love this product."
"This creamer is by far the Best Ever!!!! Its hard to find, I'm so glad I found it on Amazon."
"This is by far our favorite creamer choice in my office.  Instead of the awful powdered stuff or having to deal with a million little plastic cups, the pump is easy, doesn't require refrigeration, and the cream is actually creamy and tastes good.  Although it is ""sweetened"" it is not very sweet.  Most people that put sugar in their coffee, still do."
"I have to have my coffee every day, and I have tried many different kinds of flavored creamers.  This is the best, hands down.  I keep one at home and one at work.  It adds the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, but it still tastes like coffee.  I wish it was more readily available.  I've seen it for sale at other places (Sam's Club, for example), but Amazon definitely has the best price.  I highly recommend it for all coffee drinkers."
This is the best way to add cream and sweetener to your coffee or perhaps tea  and is so easy and convenient to use.  I keep ordering it as it has a rich and wonderful flavor.
"The BEST CREAMER EVER!!!!  I love this creamer so much, coffee without, just doesnt taste right. I just wish it was easier to find, Amazon is the only place to purchase it, but Amazon is great and its easy to order online. Thank you so much for carrying this creamer!!!!!<br />Way to go Amazon!"
"This is good stuff (some probs with the pump)<br /><br />The price has increased from 24.72 in June 09 to 30.05 today (April 7, 2010) OUCH!!!<br /><br />UPDATE - Now the price today (April 29, 2010) is 39.98 - BAD NEWS!<br /><br />UPDATE2 - Price today (May 14, 2010) 44.95..."
"this is the stuff you can only get at gas stations you cant get this incredible coffee magic anywhere else. if you dont like it ,you must be coco!"
"I purchased this because I was in a dorm room without access to a refrigerator. I had a Keurig coffee maker and I thought that this would be a great addition to my morning coffee. Well it was for the first week or so, but this industrial container is very hard to drain on your own. After a few weeks, it started to taste strange and I noticed that each shot of creamer was loaded with trans fats, which grossed me out so much that I threw the rest away and even tossed the second bottle. Yuck."
"I Work 12 hour shifts that usually turn into 13-14 hours of work and then only get about 5-6 hours of sleep in between. So naturally, I have tried just about every energy drink and shot out there.  I have to say that 5 Hour def. gets the job done with an ok flavor.  Another brand I use is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038NEOKS"">AdvoCare Spark® Energy Drink (Fruit Punch)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TRN26G"">Advocare Spark Energy Drink Canister (Mandarin Orange)</a>, that is if they have it in stock.  There are a ton of serving so it's def cost effective.  Either one are great."
"I had tried this product on a few occations in the past for afternoon fatigue. The ""boost"" in my mood and energy level was prompt, lasted several several hours, and and had no negative side effects during or after the day. The effect was not accompanied by a false sense of pleasure or desire to use it for other than its occasional use as a  mild, acceptable stimulant."
"This is simply the best energy shot you can buy, and I think I've tried about 50 different kinds. It's just the right amount of energy, and just enough caffeine to work well even if you're quite tolerant to caffeine. As a fair warning, the vitamins will make your pee turn neon yellow regardless of how much you've had to drink that day."
"5 Hour Energy is great, one of the few energy drinks/shots that I find to work on me. Great when you need to do a lot of things during the day. Sold as a single bottle they're overpriced, but they're definitely worth the discount price Amazon offers here."
"For years I just bypassed this stuff at the checkout counter because it seemed like a gimmick, but holy cow I tried it and it's great.  The advertising is right that you don't really crash when it runs out, and it doesn't make you as jittery as drinking a huge cup of coffee - for me, no jitters when I drink half, a little jittery if I drink the whole thing.  I also find that it has a mood enhancing effect. The taste is fine, like a concentrated energy drink, but you're not drinking it for the taste.  The price on Amazon is the best I've found online if you consider shipping - although watch out because they change around the prices for different flavors, I guess depending on their stock."
"I tried the DynaPep version of an energy shot, and while I feel it did the job, I experienced low blood sugar often when I was on it, as well as a few other side effects. I bought a 2 pack of 5 hour energy just to see how it works, I wasn't expecting anything other then a gimmick; it was sitting in my closet for a week or two.<br /><br />Anyway I finally took the plunge and drank one- I only need to down a half a bottle- it does the job. I drink a half every day I work to get through the day, and let me tell you, I have missing cartilage in my hips and it was getting really uncomfortable to walk. I tried taking glucosamine, but due to my diabetes, the glucosamine was a no no. The only thing I found that works tolerably well is Aleve. But 5 hour energy puts Aleve to shame. If I have hip discomfort I don't feel it at all. I have all the energy I had when I was in my 20s, and for me a half bottle seems to last 8 hours or so!<br /><br />No problems whatsoever sleeping, in fact, due to all the activities it enables me to perform, I think it aids sleep! No swings in my blood sugar levels. All in all, perfect. So far..."
"I get up at two thirty in the morning to go to work and about six am I need something to help me stay awake.  This product does just that.  I don't take it everyday but when in need of energy, this is the product.  I will admit though it taste horrible."
I'll never take this again. I had  at most half of one if these small bottles and experienced a lot of bloat( I noticeably got bigger) within a few minutes followed by lots of gas and stomach upset. It didnt taste bad and I didnt feel tired Just terribly uncomfortable.I dont even consider myself to have a sensitive stomach so im surprised and I didnt eat anything differently so I know it had to be the 5hour. I guess its not for everyone.
"A friend mentioned that 5-Hour worked well for him.  I had been tempted before to buy a bottle & try it, but I don't drink a ton of caffeine products and I almost never drink ""energy"" drinks.  So I was very skeptical and wary of this product.  But after my friend said he liked it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />My problem is I'm either a zombie in the morning, or I feel good in the morning but by about 3:30pm or 4:00pm I can barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to give this a try to see if it made any difference.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it does seem to work for me.  I've noticed that it works better when I'm tired in the afternoon than when I'm tired in the morning.  I don't feel extremely jittery and I suppose the claim of no crash is true because I never feel like I hit a wall.<br /><br />I usually notice it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes to kick in.  And I generally go from feeling like I'm going to nod off at my desk to at least being able to keep my eyes open & get some work done.  I don't feel like it gives me any super powers, hyper concentration, etc., and I don't feel like I have so much energy I'm bouncing off the walls.  Just a little boost.<br /><br />The flavor is okay; these are berry and it's kind of tart - like the flavoring is covering a bitter taste.  It's not awful, but it's not a flavor I would want to savor in a drink, etc.  I chug the thing and try to taste it as little as possible.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I'm also not using it every day.  Maybe 3 days a week.  So in that respect it's no worse than a daily Starbucks habit price-wise.  If I ever start to build a resistance to the combination of stuff that makes it work, I wouldn't try drinking MORE to counter act the effects, I would probably save my money and try something else.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm happy with how it's working for me for now.  I do feel more alert and I don't feel jittery or like I have nervous energy to burn.  When this batch is gone I'll probably get more, but I don't know that with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Pros<br />* It does give a boost of energy and I don't feel like I crash<br />* The flavor isn't as bad as I would have guessed<br /><br />Cons<br />* They're expensive, even buying them in bulk<br />* The flavor isn't as good as I would have hoped<br />* Doesn't give INSTANT energy.  Takes 10-15 minutes and is gradual<br />* Possible to build a resistance to the product? More time/use required to know for sure"
"If you are already a fan of 5-hour, then its a no brainer because its so much cheaper here than anywhere else.<br /><br />If you have no clue what 5-hour energy is, i consider it to be a bottle of vitamin-juice. you don't feel super jittery like you do after slamming coffee, but you feel like your brain is in high gear. can't really explain it any other way."
My favorite for weekly use and love the taste of pomegranate over the rest by a long shot. It has the most fruity taste in my opinion.
"Product received quickly and just as described.  Packaging was a little ripped up when arrived but no big deal.  One star less as I think this product (not just on Amazon but everywhere) is a bit pricier than it may be worth.  Although, it is obvious that I paid it, I believe they would do better if it was slightly less expensive ($2/bottle would be nice)."
"Due to a problem with child care I have to work early so I can leave work at 2:15 and pick up my son from school, this means I have to get up at 4:30AM so by Wednesday I am really dragging.<br /><br />I had seen 5 hour energy being advertised for a long time but had written it off as being a fraud without even trying it.  One day I was really dragging and felt like I was going to fall asleep<br /><br />at the wheel while driving to pickup my son so I pulled into a Walgreens to see if there was something I could buy to wake me up.  I quit drinking soda's a long time ago and cannot stand the<br /><br />taste of coffee so I decided to purchase a 2 pack of 5 hour energy to see if maybe it did work and I was wrong all this time.<br /><br />To my surprise it actually did make me feel peppy!  I now purchase them in packs of 12 and take one at 2:00 Monday - Friday, I find this gives me just enough of a boost to make it to 9:00 without<br /><br />falling asleep.  When I pick my son up I take him the gym and the '5 hour boost' has really helped my workout.<br /><br />I haven't seen any negative side effects and I have been taking 1 per day, Monday - Friday for 2 months.<br /><br />If you add the shipping and handling fee, Walmart has the same price as Amazon."
"Although this product does have an abundance of vitamin b12, which can be bad for the liver over a long period of using it, it is an AMAZING energy and moood booster.  I use it pre workout when I goto the gym a lot, and it is unreal how fast it will kick in.  I've used other's pre-workout shakes and such, but this is the easiest and quickest way to get that boost.  I've also noticed a big difference in my focus.  I can concentrate on my back muscles a lot better when doing lat pulldowns and things when taking this as oppose to not.  Def would recommend this, and use the subrscibe and save.  No other price on the net touches it.  I've been getting mine shipped for $19.83 for the past few months.  Thats less than $2.00 a bottle where my gas station by my house sells them for $3.99."
"Great price for this stuff!<br /><br />It definitely works for me, gives me a good kick when I get the afternoon sleepy-effect.<br /><br />They have a really long expiry (2013) so there is no harm in buying in bulk."
"I saw the commercials over the years and said ""yeah, right"".  But somewhere along the way, i decided to give it a try.  Like an earlier reviewer, i cant stand coffee.  So i tried it and was amazed how effective it was.  Of course the primary ingredient is caffeine and i had never used caffeine products as a performance aid.  A cup of coffee is much cheaper, but if you cant tolerate coffee, then this is the way to go, even if you have to pay quite a bit more.  I make it a point not to use it daily, but just when needed, so i dont build up a tolerance for the caffeine.<br /><br />Having said that, i raved about 5-h-e to a friend of mine.  He said he had tried it and was disappointed.  After further discussion, it came out that he was a big coffee drinker.  So if you already drink high caffeine products such as coffee, you probably wont get as much of a positive effect, if any.  For everyone else though, highly recommended."
"I have a horrible time sleeping which produces even worse mornings for waking up.  I set my alarm a little early before the time I need to be awake and drink a bottle of 5 hour energy.  Within minutes I am fully awake and ready to start the day.  It works great and I do not have any side affects, spikes, or energy drops after the 5 hours.  I recommend the product highly!"
"Reading the reviews of this products it seemes like it can affect people in different ways. With something with such a high levels of vitamins you have to be careful as an overdose of vitamins can make you feel quite unwell and even be dangerous. You certainly should stick to the reccommended doses.<br />I found it did give me a bit of an energy boost, but I felt it didnt give me the long term boost in energy that I was hoping for, plus I didnt really like the taste all that much.<br />Since I prefer all natural supplements I thought I would give a all natural supplement called Gene Eden. It gives me the long term boost of energy that I was hoping for and with it being an antiviral supplement it helps me recover from colds and viruses much quicker.<br />If you interested it is also available on amazon Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula"
"This stuff works great. Despite their cheesy commercials, it actually is INSTANT energy, and I'm talking about within a matter of seconds. You could be on the verge of falling asleep but take one of these and it instantly wakes you up. I usually don't even take a full bottle. Usually just half is enough to give me a boost."
"I can honestly say that these shots are sometimes crutches for me when I feel like I'm about to just pass out. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering and these things are PHENOMENAL for when you need to get some late night studying done, or if you need some energy to focus on exams. It takes about ~20 minutes for me to feel the effects, and it lasts for 3-4 hours for me. I feel only slightly jittery, but there's a significant difference in the amount of focus you get from a 5 hour energy than your regular energy drink. I suppose the B vitamins are to thank for that! And of course, the best part... NO CRASH! I highly recommend these if you are a college student. They are VERY beneficial and will give you that extra boost and focus you need!"
All this hype about this stuff and it hardly did anything for me. The best one for me is AMP but I guess every one is different.  What works for one may not work for another.  It's best to experiment with different drinks until you find the one that does the job.
"5-Hour Energy is probably one of the best energy drinks out there, and the effectiveness is simply amazing. I'm an vegetarian high school student taking 4 AP courses. Sometimes, I get so loaded with work that I have to go to bed at two or three in the morning and still wake up at seven. Before I used 5-Hour Energy, I'd sometimes doze off or fall asleep in my classes. However, after I used 5-Hour Energy, my life changed. Now, with only 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy, I can power through the school day and swim practice easily without feeling tired at all. My grades rose significantly, and I can actually pay attention in class. Just yesterday, I managed to power through the day with only 2 hours of sleep and 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy. The extra energy that the product gives you is definitely worth the money. The product is simply amazing."
I love this product. Gives you energy but not a shaky buzz that can happen with energy drinks. It's just a little pep that is long and consistent with no crash at the end of the day. Highly recommend.
"This is a great deal, at the store you would pay about $3 for just one bottle. These are great energy drinks, there's no crash."
Love these!  Really are better than coffee after lunch.  Orange now my favorite flavor...
"I work 85 hours a week, there some days where I just can't shake the tired feeling. I take one of the Grape flavored 5 hour energy and I am all set for the rest of my day. There is no shakeiness no rapid heart beating (that have experienced with other products)or any crash what so ever. I have turned lots of my fellow workers on to it and Amazon is the best place to buy it!"
"I've been drinking these little 5-hour energy drinks for a while now and I have to say that it's a great way to get a boost to your day. I was having a hard time waking up in the afternoons (you know, after lunch, the work day just drags sometimes and puts you to sleep) but taking one of these gave me the energy I needed to get through the days. I buy them bulk like this from Amazon because they're cheaper than buying them anywhere else. Although, I have been wondering lately what the long term disadvantages are to taking these on a regular basis.<br /><br />Either way, good product and some great tastes if you're not a fan of coffee."
Order was done well and without a problem. Employees like all of the 5 hour energy.
It works and pomegranate & grape taste good too.<br />Delivery & cost were excellent as well.
I run 12 miles every weekend. I can tell the difference when I don't use this product. I take it and a PowerGel.
Great for long drives when you are tired or just need that little extra something to help you wake up.<br />The Pomegranate taste is better than the others also.
"It came 2 days prior to the estimated delivery date, so I was very happy."
It really does what they say.  It tastes good but I don't like artificial sweeteners.
"I've finally found something that gives me the extra boost I need without making me jittery or my crashing a few hours later. As a suggestion; I like to mix my 2oz shot with Gatorade or juice of some kind. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor, so mixing it helps it blend and allows for taking in the energy over a longer period of time.<br />Only real disappointment with the product is the higher price, but it's not bad if you buy it here!"
"I don't know who essentially taste tested these little shooters but they're awful in my opinion.  It's comparable to drinking soda syrup.  I think that it's best served chilled or diluted with ice.  I bought this at a gas station during a lunch break and had it room temp. NOT RECOMMENDED in my opinion of course. To each their own.<br /><br />Despite the taste, I believe this product really works.  I'm not jittery or shaky as described in the product info and so far the only negative effect has been a very slight light-headed feeling.  I also notice that alot of tension keeps returning to my shoulders but that could be just me.  Overall, I highly recommend this product a try for anybody not overly sensitive to caffeine."
This product works GREAT for I need the extra energy every morning to get through the work outs.  I have lost 41 lbs from eating right and exercising.  The days that I don't want to work out 5 Hour energy gets me through it all.
"I am very satisfied with this product. I use it all the time when I need that pick me up in the morning. I am not a coffee drinker. I have also stopped drinking energy drinks and soda. These energy drinks give me that extra burst of energy and last longer without the crashing feeling. Also it don't seem to keep me from eating, as some energy drinks would stop the craving leaving me with the shakes and jittery from not eating.<br />The shipping was fast and the price was great.  I am very satisfied with this product!  Thank you."
"Good product lowest price I've found so far for this product. Shipped within 5 days using Super Saver shipping. Product works for me, especially when coffee is not available."
"I have used many types of energy drinks/pills over the years. This product actually works, but in reality you do not really know what is in there. One of their ingredients is ""Proprietary Blend"". It doesn't get vaguer than that. However, if you're looking for sustained energy it does do the job. Do you get exactly 5 hours of energy, probably not? Do you get a little jittery, yes sometimes? Everybody is different so results will probably be different than mine."
5hour definitely helps with that little pick-me-up everyone needs from time to time.  Easy and quick to drink and decent taste.<br />Truly beneficial before going out for a night on the town.  It keeps you alert all night and my friends and I all swear we feel better the next day.
"Fast, and great product. Works well for those days when you need extra energy when dead lines hover"
I have only used it once.  But I did notice I had more energy and no letdown.
"My job demands a lot of energy and attention to detail.  I find this to work very well for me when I am feeling physically and/or mentally tired. Some people, like my husband, may not respond to this stuff so try a bottle from the store first.  I don't think the taste is so bad.  I have te berry kind and it just tastes like a sugary drink to me.  It does have a bit of a ""kick"" to it, that is the B vitamin. I can't swallow pills, so I have had to chew my vitamins which sometimes have a bitter or tangy taste.  I would recommend this to a friend to try.  I get no crash from it, no ""withdraw"" either.  Some energy drink will give me a spell of extrem sleepyness if I have been drinking them for a while and stop, I don't get that with this stuff."
I had to pull an all-nighter but I hate the huge cans of energy drinks (sometimes they make me go to sleep). I saw the commercial for this product on tv and decided to try it out. The berry flavor's not too bad-it tastes like liquified smarties. I also liked the fact that it promises that you won't crash (I had several classes and work the following day) and that it's only 4 calories. The no-refrigeration is also handy when you only want to drink half of the bottle.<br /><br />I drank a whole bottle after deciding that half wouldn't give me enough juice to stay up. I did start feeling it after a couple of minutes and I actually lasted for about 8 more hours before I started feeling drowsy. There was no crash and I didn't feel any bad effects. I definitely recommend this to anyone and plan on using it again.
"I am what you would call a ""low energy"" person. Before I found this product, sometimes I would just tell people that I am smiling instead of going through the rigamarole of making my mouth curve at the edges. Not anymore! I take one of these in the morning before I eat my glass of strawberry Quik and it is like a rocket goes off in my mind. My coworkers have noticed the change in my behavior and I have been ""warned"" to ""tone it down"". I can now make sales calls to twice as many people as I did before. I have even found that I have enough energy after work to pursue my RC car racing dream. Nothing can stop me now. My boss said that I am far more lucid than I need to be and my pants seem to fit better than they used to."
"I love to play golf and before I start I usually hit a bucket of balls. I started noticing that my game was going down by the 12th or 13th hole. My friend was always telling me how good he felt when he used 5 HOUR so I decided to try it. Wow, I have the energy to play an entire round and no jitters. I now always carry one in my golf bag and I feel it's helping my golf game because it helps me stay in focus and not feel tired. =^..^="
"I'm a big health proponent, so I look down on most of the ""energy"" drinks out there because looking at the bottles tells you it's mostly sugar and caffeine. Not to mention most of them taste like crap.<br />These little gems seem to contain mostly vitamins, some natural supplements and some caffeine. I'm a big coffee drinker, so I know when I've had to much, like when I'm jittery or my stomach gets queasy. But I don't get a big rush from the 5-Hour drinks and I don't get a big crash.  It's pretty even for several hours, and it helps keep me focused and a bit more motivated.<br /><br />I usually take regular vitamins and some B vitamins and a little coffee to keep me going, but the formula in these things does the trick on it's own. Wish they were a bit cheaper so I could take when I want - the price limits me to just a couple times a week when I need to get things done.<br /><br />Probably won't work for everyone, but worth a try. Amazon has the best price I can find - down the street I can get them 2/ $5 but that's the best - otherwise they're way over priced."
"I'd about had it for today, just after lunch. My eyes were heavy and my brain was fuzzy. Having a boring work day didn't help one bit. I have also been fighting nodding off while driving (YIKES) every day of the last week. I took a shot of 5 hour energy around 2pm. I am now fully awake and glad I didn't try to drive home sleepy once again. All the flavors have a bite, but I put mine in the fridge when I get here and it takes the edge off the flavor by the time I'm ready to shoot in the afternoon. I don't notice the transition from sleepy to awake or when it's wearing off. This stuff rocks! Too bad about the cost tho."
"This is a great product that keeps you going without the crash! It works immediately, so there is no waiting for it to work! Although, you might want to take this early in the afternoon or mid morning! It sometimes keeps me up at night!"
"This product is a fantastic way of getting a quick boost of energy for almost any situation.<br /><br />Positive<br />+ quick acting<br />+ long lasting<br />+ no jitters or other caffeine related side effects<br />+ Flavor (some people say it is not so great, but compared to other energy drinks this is as good as it gets)<br />+ No crash, just a minor drop in energy.<br /><br />Negative<br />- Sometimes the energy rush won't last 5 hours<br />- if you drink it on a regular basis it loses some of its boost property characteristics<br />- Price<br /><br />I usually only drink a half a bottle at a time and no more than two bottles per week in order to keep feeling the boost effect fully.<br /><br />JP"
"This does provide 5 hours of energy, no crash at the end, and no jitters during the boost."
It really works. If you are running out of juice and need to push for a little longer grab a 5-Hour Energy Extra Strength Berry and you will be able to achieve all your goals.
This was delivered as promised and I've enjoyed the use of this fine product since then.
"This is a great alternative to drinking red bull, monster or rockstar and avoid all the calories."
"I still can't believe these things actually work as advertised, but for the most part they really do. You get a quick, smooth energy boost without being jittery, and no crash later. It's far more pleasant than coffee or Red Bull. However on a couple occasions I have felt a little weird while on this stuff, not jittery, but just a little funny. To counteract that, and also to make this expensive product last longer, I've drank only half a bottle at a time, which really seems to be spot on perfect for me. Great product!"
For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.
"This drink is the best energy drink I have found!  I like it because I can feel it work.  It works fast and sustains my energy without giving me shakes or making me hyper.<br /><br />I recommended it to a friend who regular drinks the big cans of energy drinks, and now he drinks these.  It is a lot less of all the bad stuff like artificial sweetener or sugar, and the same amount of the important stuff Vitamin B, caffeine, etc.<br /><br />Cheers!"
"I have chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia.  I have a lot of trouble with daytime sleepiness.  This product is not a ""cure all"" but I believe it helps."
This bottle is small. but the package is big. I drank half bottle on my way to the gym and i was hype. in a good way. i did'nt feel tired at all. no bad feeling nothing. I love this product i will continue buying it.
good deal on the energy drinks. That's the only reason i decided to purchase them through your website and not somewhere else.
This is a great product - very true as there is not a crash.  I find that drinking it cold is the way to go.  Felt an increase of energy within moments.
"5 hour energy will def. give you the kick you need. Occasionally I will use it if I have had a terribe nights sleep. It wakes me up immediately. But, I only drink half of it. A whole one is too much for me."
"I've tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn't my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice."
"The first of these I had was wonderful.  I got renewed energy and it helped me get through the rest of the day.  I've drank most of the rest of these and generally it gives me a bit of energy and does help me get through the day, but not like that first time.  There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.  Maybe it has to do with how much I've eaten before drinking this?<br /><br />The best thing about this, though, is there's no drugged feeling.  And I sleep well the night after I take this.  All-in-all, it's been a good boost for me, though.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.  But I haven't found the decaf version in anything other than citrus flavor."
I love this product! It does what it says it will do with no side effects.
"My friends think I am crazy when I rave about it, but my husband and kids know that this stuff has been life changing for me! For the past 15 years the only thing I drink 99.5% of the time is water because I prefer to eat my calories. :) But I see these 5 Hour Energy bottles EVERYWHERE, so I wondered what was the deal? Then I saw the tv commerial and figured I would at least try it, because I am an avid runner always trying to get my 5k time down, so how awesome would it be to FEEL like running rather than dragging myself to do intervals sometimes. I've been drinking it for the past 3 months and it has worked wonders for me! I'm telling everyone about it.<br /><br />I found for best results I drink half the bottle around 11am and the other half around 4pm usually after eating a snack or drinking a protien shake. This gets me through an tough afternoon workout, and once I get home from work I have the energy/motivation to cook, clean, do laundry, or whatever tasks I would normally just lay around and wish I had the energy to do. Even more amazing I can stay up about an hour later each night, but still wake up early, feeling refreshed and ready for a morning workout. I always drink some about 30 minutes before a race and usually before a hard workout.<br /><br />Cons....Well, I did find that if I drank it on an empty stomach I would get some pain in my right side. :) But I'm still sold on it!  I sometimes just drink half a bottle all day and don't drink it on the weekends or on vacations because it's not good to be addicted to anything (but Jesus) :), and you don't want to get immune to it because you want it to work when you need it to plus it is kind of expensive...<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't found anyone else who loves it as much as I do, but I still say TRY IT!"
"i drank one of these at 8:40 am and didnt get to sleep until 4 am!! maybe there were other factors involved but, if i drink a cup of coffee at around 5 or 6 pm i dont get to sleep until late as well. anyway my local dollar store sells these for 1.50 so check around. still a bit expensive but ill drink em. berry tastes decent. lemon lime is atrocious."
"5-hour tasted fine and I felt somewhat ""energized"" as I hoped. But, 5-hour, like all of these energy drinks (Monster, RockStar, RedBull, Cocaine etc.) is obscenely overpriced liquid caffeine. As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these ""proprietary blends"" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money. Buy ANY drink you like and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill like max strength NoDoz or Vivarin. Cheers."
"I know the effects from this are different for everybody, but this is just how it was for me.<br /><br />Within ten minutes of taking the whole bottle, I noticed that my heart was practically beating out of my chest. Within thirty minutes I felt exhausted to the point that I had to plop down on to the couch. If that was not a crash, then I don't know what is. But within a few hours I felt normal again.<br /><br />I would say that for the money it is not worth it. Just take a multivitamin and a strong cup of coffee."
"I'm convinced these things are a placebo.  After taking one per day for a week and noticing no difference, I 5-hour-energy roofied my roommate's soda before bed and he went to sleep without a problem.<br /><br />Maybe if you believe they work, they'll work for you; they didn't do anything for me.  For this price, they should make my eyes incapable of being closed."
"I wanted to try this product to see what all the buzz was about with the ""5 Hour Energy"" drinks.  Seemed like everyone is using them.  I had trouble finding them in local stores, so I ordered this box from Amazon.  The price was good and there were no problems with the shipping.  There is only enough caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee in each bottle.  I'm a huge coffee drinker, so this product did not work for me.  I did not feel any more energy when I needed it and it did not keep me awake or alert.  In fact, I got stomach cramps and diarrhea for several days after using this product.  I'm physically fit and do the P90X workouts. I eat healthy food and rarely have abnormal bowel movements or diarrhea.  As a test, I did not use this product for a week and felt fine with normal bowel movements.  I then used another 5 Hour Drink and the next day, diarrhea again!  It may work for other people, but it did not work for me!"
"5-hour energy drink works within minutes.  It gives me that extra boost I sometimes need to get started in the morning and it lasts a long time.5 Hour Energy, Berry Flavor, 2 Oz, Box/12"
My husband works graveyard and can't live without it. It helps without the crash you get from other enery drinks
I love this stuff! It's a God sent Remedy for hangovers!.... I understand the health concerns many people have and I can also see that this can be habit forming. I make sure I only take one every so often and not everyday.
"Good price, flavor, fast delivery And good presentation overall. Very eficient when playing  golf,  it really gives extra Energy and it helps to achieve  a better game"
"Half of this bottle saved me from falling asleep at the wheel on a late night drive from Vegas back to LA.<br /><br />Unlike my usual goto Red Bull, I didn't feel a instant rush when I took 5 Hour, the alertness came gradually. My heart wasn't rushing, but I was wide awake. I didn't crash afterwards either. And was able to fall asleep without a problem once we got home."
"On this particular flavor: I find this is the best when chilled or at room temp, with Lemon Lime as a second.  I keep these in my desk at home and at work.<br /><br />I've been a fan of 5 Hour Energy for a few years now, and it certainly works.  I have noticed there are particular times when the coffee buzz is more preferred than 5 Hour, but basically, I use it like so: Before noon, I'll use coffee.  When that afternoon/post lunch slump comes on, this is the perfect time for HALF of a 5 hour energy.  It's enough to keep you awake.  If you really need to get up and go, drink half, and then an hour later, drink the other half.  Of course, YMMV, but I've converted a few of my co-workers to using this method."
"I have twin two-year olds and a very heavy workload so these help me get through the day. They're a really good deal if you choose the ""subscribe and save"" option. Rivals the price at the local Wal-Mart."
Seems like a good product however the price is prohibitive for regular use. I would recommend persons use it only under special circumstances like a long automobile trip for a lift and safety. I would also recommend drinking only 1/2 the product and saving the remainder for later. The manufacturer recommends use within 72 hours of opening the bottle. For those who are having a caffeine problem the smaller dose or the decaffeinated product would be better.
This product works great for an alertness boost.  There is no sugar rush.  Just a little caffeine and B vitamins.  No crash either. I would recommend this product to everyone.
"Being a busy SAHM of 3, I occasionally get the days where I want to wave my white flag & give in. But that is never an option. Usually my go to source is coffee, but depending on the level of energy I need, several cups might be the answer. But that answer has me going to the bathroom more than I have time for. So I was pleasantly surprised when I drank a 5 Hour Energy instead. I had more than enough energy to make it all the way to bedtime! I never felt bogged down or sluggish at any point. & I had zero issues when it came to falling asleep. Not to mention not having to stop to use the bathroom every 30 minutes. Definitely my saving grace! & although it is very tart, I have to admit I'm a fan of the berry flavor.<br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I us1ed 5 hour energy to help me stay awake at my nieces slumber party to help take care of all the kids and it was such a big help! No 20 minutes of energy and then crash hard like coffee. I was able to help out and have fun with the kids, no problem. ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I have low energy most days because of a hectic lifestyle and too little sleep. But life goes on and when I was feeling tired and lethargic one 5-hour energy shot really helped perk me up without making me jittery nervous and more importantly not keeping me up at night. I experienced a natural energy boost when I needed to get through a vigorous workout class or just be able to do chores around the house.<br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"1am, downtown going-away house party. I've been here for hours and I'm starting to lose energy but the fun is only just starting.  What to do?!?  So I drank a 5-Hour ENERGY® and never gave my tiredness a second thought! I felt naturally alert and energized like the night had just began. If I had chosen an energy drink instead, I would have felt jittery and bloated due to the carbonation in the drink. Just a little sip is all I needed. I would definitely buy this again!  FYI, I also snacked on a banana at the same time.  I think the two together really gave me the shot of energy so I would suggest hungry 5 hour energy fans to try this healthy snack along with the drink,<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."

I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and I must say that it really works for that afternoon dip between lunch and dinner. It tastes really good and it works better and longer than a cup of coffee. I will buy this product again just to have it around the house in case I need it.
"I received two free samples to try out and I decided to try the first one on the night I did my job until midnight. I had gotten up at six am and knew I would be up until past midnight so I decided to try the first one after dinner to see if it would help keep me up until midnight, I didn't think it was going to taste very good but I was presently surprised, I certainly didn't feel any different than I did before I drank it but I did decided to try the next one the next night with no change, I guess I just have natural energy :)I did not have any jitters or anything like that which I was worried about.<br /><br /> I would rather drink that then soda if it works, maybe I had too much caffeine before, I will try it again<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I tried out the 5-Hour Energy drink and was expecting an unpleasant taste, but no it tastes great!  I use the 5-Hour Energy to help me beat the mid-afternoon slump, after having done housework, errands and schoolwork all morning.  5-Hour Energy left me refreshed and ready to finish the day and evening.  I never experienced the after sugar slump that you get with so many energy drinks or the shaky feeling like you get from too much caffeine.  It was great all I experienced was energy and a great tasting drink.  I love 5-Hour Energy and it's a great value for the price!<br /><br />I did receive a free sample from 5-Hour Energy and Smiley360 to try out, the review is based on my actual experience!"
"I have a 5 month old, a preschooler, and a teenager so I'm forever tired!  I hated the taste, but it did what I needed it to do. I got energy enough to keep going, but not so much that I was jittery. When it wore off I also didn't crash out like other products powered with caffeine. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I was skeptical trying 5 hour energy as a regular source of an extra boost, but i really like it! It is good because it gives you energy and vitamins without the jitters. You can actually focus better without side effects (in my experience). Sometimes coffee just doesn't help and the 5 hour energy berry is my go to energy boost. I would recommend you give it a try.

"Yes, it's a little pricy but compared to most energy drinks out there, 5-Hour Energy just stands out for it's contents and performance. It has ZERO sugar, ZERO herbal stimulants and only 4 calories! I was a little worried that I would feel jittery but that wasn't the case at all, and now I use it before my workouts to get that extra push I need some days. Also, I was so happy to find out it comes in many different flavors; berry and pomegranate are my favorite! If u need an extra push to get you through the day's tasks or workouts, give this product a try! (I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360) Thanks!!!!"
I recieved my 5 hour energies very quickly but unfortunately there were only 11 in my 12 pack.  I emailed customer service to let them know what happened and they immediately took care of the problem and sent me a whole new package.  I was very impressed with how quickly they responded and were willing to help.
"Keeps me going for about 3 hrs, Great price, better than drinking carbonated drinks that are bad for me. Easy to carry and low calories."
"Five hour energy worked for me, I am sensitive to most products, but I did fine on this and I was nervous but did not end jittery."
"Have to say that I dont get much effect out of this product.  Has a nice berry flavor.<br /><br />Was shipped in a timely manner so that, with the fact that I dont much effect out of it, earned it 2 stars."
"I'm a busy mom who normally runs on coffee, but 5 Hour Energy is a great lower calorie alternative. I don't get the shakes like I do after one too many espressos, and I can tuck one of these into my purse easily. A quick shot and I'm good to go, without the possibility of coffee stains or spills.<br /><br />I was amazed at how long it lasted as well. I was used to having to refuel my caffeine tanks around 2:30 pm, but I took the shot at 7 a.m., and kept going until 6 without a hitch.<br /><br />I may have to start buying by the case. Great product.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"5 Hour Energy is great for an on-the-go lifestyle because it is a quick shot to drink down. It is also conveniently packaged in a small, easy to store bottle that is perfect for your pocket, purse or gym bag. There is little sugar & caffeine so it keeps those yucky feeling crashes away. The energy it gives you is subtle yet helpful, comparable to a sugar rush I would get from drinking soda as a child. The only difference is that I don't feel awful afterwards. 5 Hour Energy comes in some yummy flavors too. Berry is pretty good but I do prefer the Pom. One star off because these could never replace a good old fashioned cup of coffee; but they are a fabulous alternate energy boost!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360"
"I wasn't a believer, until I tried for myself. I received a free sample from 5hour and smiley360. So I tried and wow. I don't understand how a little bottle could pack so much energy. No crash afterwards, no jittery feeling, no heart racing. Gave me the energy to get through the day when I was super tired. Would I recommend? YES!!! Again I received sample from 5hour and smiley360.com. No compensation and I never tried before. I have though bought since the sample and recommend to put in fridge b/c I like 5hour cold as I do everytthing I drink"
"Tasted gross made my stomach upset and I felt jittery all over. Its kinda pricey if you wanted to drink this every day, which I will never do again."
"I like to work out in the morning, and at times it can be hard to jump out of bed when I'm tired. I've started drinking half of the 5-Hour Energy bottle as soon as my alarm clock goes off. By the time I put on my workout clothes and sneakers I'm already more awake, and the 5-Hour Energy keeps me going for a great workout! The berry flavor is my favorite, but I have tried others as well.  p.s I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 (the first time I tried it out)."
"I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G"">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.  Hope this helps someone!"
"I've always been a huge fan of 5-hour energy drinks, but it's just too expensive for me to take on a regular basis, I know I tried! I've always preferred not to drink coffee, the only way I can stand it is if I overload it with sugar so that's kind of a bust. My co-worker who is a crazy health nut introduced me to this energy stack, Energy Booster Stack (90 Day Servings!) Better Than Jack3d, Red Bull, Monster, Hemorage, Caffeine, Rockstar Drink which I've been taking in the morning and really liking it. If you ever taken raspberry ketones, dmaa, or yohimbine extract then you know what I mean when I talk about an energy high that feels different from caffeine.<br /><br />I also like the cost, very affordable. I'll always be a 5-hour energy drinker here and there but if you need a consistent source of energy and are concerned with price, this is the most effective and cost effective energy booster I've found. Hope this helps someone!"
"After looking at a site that referenced 5-hour energy and finding out that NALT (N-Acetyl, L-Tyrosine) was an ingredient, I went to wikipedia to find out the other ingredients and lo and behold all five major cognitive-enhancing supplements (I'm including the B-Complex Vitamins here)including in this drink were the four that constituted my core stack for mental-intensive tasks (I substitute Alpha-GPC for CDP-Choline on occasion, due to it's effectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier . The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"". ALL which can be bought cheap on here and combined at 1/5 the cost. Not to mention you can split the caff. tabs in half when you're already ""up"" and don't want to risk the anxiety that comes with a full tablet, which consists of 200mg of caffeine. Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it. But that markup is straight nasty. Good luck!"
"Kind of had the opposite effect on me.  A friend recommended I try 5 hour energy and use it to replace my morning cup of coffee.  If anything it actually made me tired and groggy.  I guess it has a different influence on each individual.  I would suggest trying one first, before buying in bulk."
"I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking ""Go Girls"" for a while and I loved them. I wanted to try the 5 hour energy because the ""Go Girls"" kept me up at night.<br /><br />First of all, I understand first hand that this drink affects people differently. Like I said my Dad loves it and swears by it, myself, not so much.<br /><br />I decided to drink only half the bottle to start with, so it wouldn't be too overwhelming. But, even with half the bottle it really messed me up.<br /><br />I felt tired but my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was pounding so much, like I just ran 10 miles in record time! The rest of my body felt awful too. My arms were jittery, yet kinda numb. My legs felt like spaghetti and my stomach felt like it was in knots. Andy even though my body felt like it was all amped up I still felt exhausted and needed to keep putting my head down. I also felt like I just wanted to have a meltdown and cry. It was awful!<br /><br />Be careful if you try this. Take a little bit at a time. For the first time take it when you don't need to do anything or go anywhere. Like I said everyone reacts differently to it. My Dad has these like 2 or 3 times a week and loves it. So try it for yourself, but this was my experience."
"I thoroughly loved the product and got a great price through Amazon.  I have diabetes and suffer from job layoff depression.  I purchased the product for it's low calorie and promise of energy boost to combat my health conditions, and it WORKS GREAT without any 'buzz'. I was definitely about to stay focused after the drink and be more productive in the tasks I need to complete for several hours, instead of getting tired and having no energy to keep going."
"I drive between Pittsburgh and Philly most weekends.  Usually an hour or two into the drive, I start to nod off with highway hypnosis.  When I get in the car I pop one of these down the pie hole and no nodding off.  I arrive at my destination alert and without the Red Bull and triple latte induced jitters normally experienced prior to finding this product.  Experienced none of the negative effects I saw in other reviews.  I suspect there may be secret agendas involving reputation assasination with some of those posters."
"During a scooter tour of the southwest (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizon), a group of us decided to try one of the 5 hour energy drinks (I think I had the Berry 1.93 ounce, regular strength).  I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again."
"I stock pile and train with 5 Hour and am glad for it, for the Zombie Apocalypse is near. Miami yesterday, tomorrow everywhere. Stock up while you can."
"The second I tasted this product, I knew that drinking it as a shot wasn't for me; but, I also knew, just how it would work, and I don't know why it isn't written on the package somewhere.<br /><br />This is the best way to use it:<br /><br />  Take a bottle of water and pour in the amount you want to drink of the shot - half for some or the entire bottle for others.  This tastes exactly like the flavored bottled waters that you can buy.  Everyone is different, but all the flavors were good like this, to me, except the lemon or lime or whatever that one is.  As a matter of fact, the grape flavor added to water tastes identical to the flavored Dasani grape water.<br /><br />  I take a bottle of this 5 hour energy/water concoction to the gym with me.  It has helped me get back into working out.  I don't need it everyday, but some days it helps me overcome the tendency to flake out and not go, when I feel tired.  I imagine that with lots of things, the effectiveness is compromised if you use it everyday.<br /><br />  I also have A.D.D. and just finishing any task is a challenge.  This helps me with that...as well.  I know a little bit about the ingredients in this and a lot of the energy comes from the l-tyrosine, which is used by some to treat a.d.d.<br /><br />Happy living!"
"I loved the energy I got from the 5 hour energy. It was quick and natural and helped me feel alert, but I did not experience any jitters or shakiness that usually accompanies when I drink an energy drink. It also gave me the most energy out of any energy drink I've ever used. When the energy did wear off it didn't feel like a crash. It was a completely natural and gradual decrease as the day went on. I found I was able to get a lot more done in my day.<br /><br />I recently used the 5 Hour energy on a long trip I took with my kids. Normally a few minutes into the trip I'm struggling with alertness and usually have to drink a lot of energy drinks to stay awake. But with one 5 Hour energy I was able to drive the entire trip without any additional energy drinks. I was alert and focused and felt better than I had in a long time. At the end of our journey instead of having an energy crash and needing to go straight to bed, I didn't even notice that it was wearing off and I never felt tired until it was time to go to bed that night. This was after getting only 4 hours of sleep the night before the trip. the 5 Hour energy definitely did it's job and I will always use one before I make any future driving trips!<br /><br />I love that the 5 Hour Energy bottles are just a small dose bottle instead of a full sized soda drink that I have to chug down before I can feel any increase in energy. And even better, you don't even need the entire bottle! Just drink half for a medium amount of energy or the entire thing for a huge dose in energy. And what you don't drink stays good for up to 3 days in the fridge, so you can have one ""pick me up"" on day 1 and use the rest on day 3.<br /><br />Cons: I think some of the flavors can be improved. At first I didn't like the flavor at all, and in fact choked on it and literally had to gag it down. The next day I had left the 5 hour energy in the fridge and then I was able to drink it with a lot more ease. Although there was still a definite after taste similar to that of a Diet soda.<br /><br />I think I would enjoy a flavor other than Berry a lot better. Yet if you are used to diet sodas or energy drinks you probably won't notice any distaste in the flavors. I'm used to drinking just straight up caffeinated sodas so it was a bit different for me.<br /><br />Of all the energy drinks I've tried, the 5 Hour energy definitely gave me the most energy! It felt like a natural burst of energy and for me it lasted more than 5 hours.<br /><br />Will I use 5 Hour energy again? Yes! For every trip I take where I will be driving and for days when I need to focus more!"
"I have never tried energy drinks before trying 5-Hour Energy. ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."" One was berry and the other was pomegranate. I shared one with my co-worker. We tried them at work. She doesn't drink a lot of caffeine so she felt hers kick in right away. I have coffee every morning so mine wasn't as noticeable...until I was done with work. I usually go straight home after work because I'm too tired to do anything, but this time I felt like I had energy and I went shopping. Loved it! I had energy that I wasn't even aware of! No jitters or sugar crash. It was great. Will definitely try it again. Thank you to Smiley 360 for my free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY."
"5 Hour Energy was like a dream come true for my working spouse.  As a manager, on his feet for thirteen hours a day gets extremely exhausting so when I agreed to receiving a sample from Smiley online in exchange for my opinions, he was the first in line to try it.  I was impressed that it contained B6, B12 & B3 along with folic acid and only had a small amount of caffeine.  My husband tried the 5 Hour Energy after a full day of work in hopes of being able to stay awake and watch the baseball game.  He was surprized that did give him a few more hours of energy.  5-hour energy also complies with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act as enforced by the FDA."
I like to use 5-Hour energy from time to time to help my self get some more energy.  It can't replace a poor diet and no exercise in my mind but if you remember to eat healthy and get some exercise but sometimes just need a little something-something instead of ho-hum coffee this is a good option. A lot better than a soda too! It definitely picks you up and perks you up--I think even better than coffee. It is good for me in the late afternoon when I need to keep working but I am just kind of tired. It gives me energy to keep going. It tastes great too--not too sweet! I keep one stashed in my purse for emergencies too. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.
"I am unable to drink caffeinated energy drinks, as I am too sensitive to large amounts of caffeine, and it makes me ill. I get jittery and get a massive headache. Additionally, sugarless items usually taste horrible to me. These are the reasons I was hesitant to try 5 hour energy. I received a sample from Smile.y.com to try, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised! The taste was great for only containing 4 calories per bottle! There was absolutely no jittery feeling, no headache, and no crash!! I'm not going to say I'll drink it everyday or completely replace my am cup of coffee, but I've used it since I've tried it, and I really feel like it gives me an extra boost when I need one! I feel like everyone could use this at one time or another. It contains B vitamins instead of a ton of caffeine so there's no jitters or crash. =)<br />""I received a free sample of 5 hour energy by Smiley360"""
"I liked that the 5 hour Energy gave me that little extra lift I needed, especially in the afternoon - evenings, when I needed it most.  It didn't make me feel jittery or shakey and as other products have, since I have anxiety to begin with.  It also didn't keep me from falling asleep at night. The only thing I didn't really like was the taste/after taste.  It tasted a little bit mediciney to me.  But, I just drank something else, like some tea or something after taking the 5 Hour Energy to get the taste out of my mouth.  ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and it changed me. I was so impressed with how much of a boost it gave me without making me nervous or having racing heartbeat.

"""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.""  When I first tried this I was apprehensive that it might make me jittery.  Not the case.  I was a great pick me up just the right amount.  No jitters or odd feelings.  And when it was time for bed I had no problem going to sleep and didn't feel any crash sensation.  I would recommend this if you have things to do or need a little pick me up in the afternoon.  I tried it before 3 pm and by 9 pm I went to bed with no problem and slept like a baby.

I usually hit a wall right around 2:00 in the afternoon at work. I start yawning and my eyes get heavy. I tried 5hr energy to get passed that feeling but it didn't really help.

I absolutely love 5-hour ENERGY! I use it after work right before I head to the gym to work out and it gives me that extra boost I need to make it through my work out! The cherry and pomegranate flavors taste great. Its definitely something you should always keep in your purse and buy them in larger quantities to save money and so you dont have to buy as often. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for that extra boost. Its great that its only 4 calories also!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360
"I received one six pack from Smiley 360 to review and I wasn't sure how I would react to it.  I don't drink coffee, so I only drank 1/2 bottle at a time. I was wide wake and full of energy!  I got so many things done on my to-do-list, while I was using 5-Hour Energy. I wasn't jittery from the caffeine.  This is an awesome product and I would recommend it!"
"I tried 5 Hour Energy when I had a long night with my 3 year old and had to stay up the next day with only 1 hour of sleep.  It definitely woke me up, and kept me awake for the duration of the day, or at least until my body picked itself back up.  I didn't have a crash afterwards, nor was my stomach full like it is with some other energy drinks.  I do agree with others on the taste.  It isn't a terrible taste but it isn't a great taste.

"I received 3 sample bottles of 5-Hour Energy from Smiley 360...and LOVED this product! I loved how the taste was pleasant and there was no strong aftertaste like most products have. It also was fast acting, gave me the energy I needed and I never experienced that 'crash' you would get with caffeine or sugar. I am not a coffee drinker, and have tried to stay away from caffeine because I always seem to feel worse off than I did before taking it. But with 5-Hour energy, I can use it as often as I need and don't have to worry about regretting it later! It also got me through most of my (BORING) day at work without making me jittery or jumpy.

"I love using 5-Hour Energy to keep up with my kids, my family's hectic schedule - you name it!  This product gives me the boost of energy I need and I don't get left with jitters like I have with other energy products on the market.  This product is great for when you start to feel sluggish in the afternoon and need that extra pick me up to finish out your day.  I still love my morning cup of coffee, but 5-Hour energy is there to help me out later if needed.  I would definitely recommend this product to others!<br /><br />*Disclosure:  I received a sample of this product for review courtesy of Smiley360.com on behalf of 5-Hour Energy."
"Recently I returned to the work force after being a stay-at-home mom for over two years. I am not going to lie, I have been doing this work thing for almost two months now and it has not gotten any easier but rather seems to more difficult. The biggest problem I have is lack of energy. Sitting at a desk for 8 hours then having to drive to work in traffic to get home to cook and play with my little guy takes a lot of energy and I obviously don't get enough sleep because I also have to spend time with the hubby and catching up on my shows.<br /><br />I have tried several energy pick me ups over the years, especially during those late nights in college when I was cramming for a test or needed to finish a paper but have found that they all make me feel weird and I don't like the jittery, lack of concentration feeling they give you then followed with a serious crash when they wear off. So, when I was presented with the opportunity to try 5-hour ENERGY I was a little hesitant but the one day driving home from work and I had to pull off the freeway because I was falling asleep did it for me. I need to try something!!!<br /><br />5-hour ENERGY does EVERYTHING it says it is going to do! It gives you a sudden burst of energy that lasts with you and when it has filtered through your blood stream you don't experience a sudden crash. It did not feel like I had taken anything but rather made me feel like I had just woken up from a nice nap and was ready to take on the day! Plus it actually tasted good! I tried the Berry Flavor and it didn't leave an aftertaste or yucky taste like others have. The secret behind 5-hour ENERGY is that it is made from everyday key ingredients that are found in your everyday foods (which truthfully we don't get enough of) with an added bonus of caffeine but no more than what you would find in your own cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the best pick me up ANYONE can use safely and take my word for it, you will not feel any side effects.<br /><br />**I received a sample for my review from Smiley360. However these views and ideas are my own."
"I love that when I am in that afternoon slump I can reach in my purse and pull this out and drink it and it gives me just a boost to get through the rest of the day. It didnt make me jittery and I usually take it at around 3pm and had no problems going to bed at 9pm :) Before recieving my free sample I was very concerend about weather or not I would be bouncing off the walls or able to sleep, but since my samples I buy them regularly. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I don't like coffee, but have tried caffeine pills before, but this stuff is much better, and works quicker. The taste can be kinda bitter (I usually get grape, but have also tried orange and lemon when that was all the store had available), so I always chug it down in one gulp, and then either drink some other kind of flavored juice or chew gum to get rid of the taste. I only use it for general alertness, never as a substitute for sleep, to try to stay up late for whatever reason. It's mostly just to ward off that ""blah"" feeling that sometimes hits in the afternoon, so I'll drink a bottle sometime between 12-2pm. But never after 2pm, because I want to make sure that it's completely worn off by the evening, so it doesn't effect my sleep-cycle. Sometimes I'll drink one bottle first thing in the morning when I wake up. But then I make sure at least 5 hours have passed before taking another one that same day. Taken effectively, it works perfectly. TWO THUMBS UP!"
I must say I loved 5 hour energy!! This product did not taste as bad as I thought it would taste. I was super surprised by the flavor. I used this one morning because I was up most of the night with my son. I had a lot of work to do the next day and I had absolutely no energy! I must say that this product started to work immediately. It was nice to feel that burst of energy. It was actually pretty refreshing to have energy for a change LOL I can honestly say that this will be my number 1 go to when I am exhausted and have a lot of work to do. It actually works!!
"I love 5 Hour Energy! It is better than any other energy supplement out there, in my opinion. There really is no crash and it helps me focus and get through my tasks of the day. I recently started work and waking up early and being tired and exhausted for the first week go hand in hand. 5 Hour Energy helped me get through the first week and I'm now on to my second and 5 Hour Energy is along for the ride. Try it today and you'll see results! I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I was skeptical about 5 hour energy... but I have to say that it was the BEST tasting energy shot I've ever used, AND it really did deliver - when I took it, I never felt sluggish (like I normally do) after lunch.  I wasn't jittery or shaky, but just felt like my normal self whose energy didn't fade!  It was wonderful!  I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"When i first received this product i was nervous to try it but after hitting amed day slump one afternoon i decided to try it. my first time using it I was really surprised by how much energy i had with no side effects. plus i didn't come down hard off the energy of it like others or have to run to ythe batroom every five minutes to pee like with coffee. Not sure I buy it all the time as it does get expensive but a definite once or twice a week use isn't bad.<br /><br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I just started a new job, which is mornings, instead of the 2nd shift I worked for over 20 years, and am also taking classes for real estate..I used 5 hour energy and was able to make it through the day and my night class, without being jittery or tired. I had plenty of energy and felt great! When I drink soda, or coffee, I have to drink numerous cups to give me the same amount of energy, and it does not last long..and it makes me feel jittery and nervous feeling. I have purchased it on numerous occasions, and will continue to do so..I have some in my fridge at this moment, for when I need the extra burst of energy!<br /><br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I had never tried 5-Hour Energy before, but had heard good things about it. I received a free sample from Smiley 360 and gave it a try.  It helped me get through a very busy day when I started dragging midway. It made me feel alert and more productive and ready go keep going to get my job done that afternoon.  I liked that it was easy to use and I didn't have to go find a cup of coffee.  This is something I'll buy and continue using. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and am so glad I did!"
"I have been using 5 hour for a good while now and find it works great for me.  I get drowsy at work and this ends those sagging, dozing feelings.  I find though that if I take it and continue to sit that it works much slower.  If I get up and walk around for a while it kicks in faster.  I do not get a sudden burst of energy but find that I just am no longer sleepy.  No jitters or other ill effects.  Try it."
"I love this flavor of 5 hour energy, I have 3 kids ages 6, 2 and 9 months and let me just say I am tired all the time!! 5 Hour Energy gives me the energy I need to get things done around my house and it doesnt make me feel shakey or have a big ""crash"" when it wears off, I use it all the time.I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I recently purchased the multi-pack of pomegranate 5 Hour Energy shots for a driving trip, because I know that after only an hour on the road, I tend to fall asleep at the wheel.  When I have eight hours of driving ahead of me, that's not the safest place to be.  Now, I knew that 5 Hour had the potential to keep me alert, because I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and it had worked VERY well to keep me focused on house cleaning - why not driving?  Eyes drooping, halfway to Knoxville, I grabbed a 5 Hour Energy out of my purse and downed the thing.  I'll admit - the flavor isn't the greatest, and Orange and Pomegranate are the only flavors I've tried that I can tolerate.  However, within ten minutes I was alert, wide-eyed, singing along with the radio and finally appreciating the beautiful weather as I drove through the mountains.  5 Hour, you're a life saver!"
Started a new job and I'm sitting at my desk hours before the work day starts and still there way after the work day ends.  My boss calls me the Energizer Barbi.  My secret 5-Hour Energy Shots.  They are quick and easy.  No need to worry about finding a cup of coffee or soda....not to mention that those options don't last very long and once again I'm in search of more.  5-Hour Energy shots help to keep me alert to get the job done.  They has lasting power with out any jitters or nervousness.  I feel like me but just more awake and focused. It is safe and contains no herbal stimulants.
"I have tried a couple flavors of this, Pomegranate is my favorite, and I think they work great! I have a busy 3 year old and work full time, so there are times I need an extra boost.  I have tried other energy drinks and always feel anxious and jittery.  I didn't get that with 5 Hour Energy.  I felt a noticeable boost in energy about 10 minutes after drinking it and it tapered off throughout the day, I never had the crash I was expecting. I wouldn't use these everyday, but for when you need the extra boost, it's perfect!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I used to buy the 2 packs almost daily at over $5 a pack. When I saw this case I just had t get them. I love 5 hour energy. I only use them on long drives now, but its s till a great product!"
"5 hour energy is fantastic for myself & co-workers who work @ 4AM.  Halfway through out workday, drinking 1 5 hour energy will get us through the rest of the work day, and give us the energy we need to participate in family activities after work as well!<br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"Yes, it is expensive to use every day.  But if you need an energy boost every day, you might need to sleep more.  But when you really do need that extra boost to get through the day, this stuff really works.  The taste is not so bad.  It has gotten better.  And it seems to start working rather quickly. Better than soda or coffee, especially if you are driving.  You don't have to drink that much to get that same boost, so less potty stops.  :) I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. And have bought it myself since."
"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and being a stay at home mom to a 7 month old infant who is disabled can be very tiring. With the help of 5-hour energy drinks I was able to kick start internal engine and be alert for my child. I didn't experience any jitters or crashes. I will admit in the stores this product can be very expensive. Amazon has this product priced very reasonably. I would recommend it to others, however not all will have the same experience as I."
"The five hour energy drink has been a true blessing for my hubby, He has to be up and driving first transit busses at 5am every morning, He grabs a morning cup of coffee, But like a few hours later he gets so very tired. So I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY from Smiley360 for doing a test review. And I thought who better to test this 5 hour energy product out than my hubby who really could use some energy to be alert for driving, Because he doesn't like drinking more than one cup of coffee a day. Well, he agreed to try them out. The first day he tried them he was like. WOW, This stuff really works. So I will tell you he doesn't leave home without his 5 hour energy drink. And he has bought more of it this week, Thank you for the free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY from Smiley360, Anybody that wants something to stay alert without the side effects of coffee and soda , etc. Should try 5 hour Energy"
"I used 5 Hour Energy after eight hours at work to complete a twelve hour day. My alertness and energy improved after about ten minutes.I felt great. It works better than a cup of coffee and I felt more alert and the effects lasted longer. I also had no jitters. I will definitely use this product from now on.

I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I really liked using this product. It tasted good and didn't leave me jittery. Even my husband who works the night shift has started using 5 hour energy regularly since it is safe. It's packed full of vitamins and comes in a variety of flavors. I do want to mention though that it does contain niacin flush if anyone is sensitive to it. I will purchase this again!!
"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I have never tried this product before but had seen commercials of the product on tv.  I am a busy mother of 4 daughters (ages 6, 5, 3, and 2).  I have a very full schedule and as most moms know the afternoon hours are just when I start dragging.  Maybe a nap is what I need, but no time (literally!).  So I tried a small bit of 5 hour (half a bottle) just to see how it would go when I hit that afternoon drag-- and yep it was just what I needed to complete my day.  My mood is good, my energy is still on the go, and I am not dragging just struggling to make it through dinner and bathtime and the wonderful thing is no headaches.  This is a huge help to me and I am so thankful to 5 hour for this aid to my day- and yes it has made it on my grocery list!  I hope others find it as helpful as I have!"
"We recently recieved 2 samples of the 5-Hour Energy and my Husband and my Son inlaw used them the next morning. They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard. So in my oppinion the 5-Hour Energy is well worth the cost, and I would buy and use them again. ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I have been restricted to 1 cup of coffee a day and have been hating it. So when I got the free sample, I decided to try it before I went to the gym in the morning. Within 10 minutes, was not tired and seemed to have a little more spring in my step than ususal. And, it kept me up and going for the full 5 hours, but no racing heart or multiple bathroom trips from coffee. So I had the second one around 2 and it got me through the rest of work, no upset as coffee would have done. I am totally happy with this product and keep a good stock in the fridge for whenever I need a pick me up ( it does taste a little better when reallllly cold!)"
"It's ridiculously well priced for what you get - it lasts like it says it does, it doesn't taste horrible.. it's win all over!<br />Not the best for first thing in the morning, but that afternoon lull, it's  great. It'll get you through the day with no problems.<br />Also, I LOVE to take it right before working out - it gives me a massive amount of energy and I get a great burn.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
After a long week of projects at work I was exhausted. I had a closing project that needed to be completed and came in on a Saturday to finish the work. Well I needed a pick-me-up and did could not risk feeling the crash later on. So I took a 5-hour energy and sure enough I was ready to go. I love 5-hour energy and I recommend it to anyone who needs some energy.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.
"5-Hour ENERGY is an AWESOME product.<br /><br />I take 5 college courses in a semester. While this might not be such a big deal to people however; when I explain everything else in my life you will ask yourself ""how does she do it?"" Wasn't there a movie out about that? I am 46 years old and completed an Associate's degree in a year and a half. I am married with two children and my husband works 6-7 days a week.<br /><br />I was drinking coffee like it was going out of style and was a bit concerned about all the sugar and caffeine in my body because let's face it, who can drink coffee without sugar? And because 5-Hour ENERGY is loaded with Vitamin-B I was able to reload and be ready for the rest of my courses after drinking it.<br /><br />My favorite is the berry flavor but, I do like grape, orange, lemon-lime and pomegranate as well. Ever since I tried it I have used 5-Hour ENERGY every day. It gives me a boost of energy to finish my homework, housework, dinner or whatever it is that is left to do for the day. Plus it doesn't give me the jitters or keep me up at night when I need to rest.<br /><br />I recommend using 5-Hour ENERGY when you need a lift. I personally prefer purchasing it rather than coffee now and always will.<br /><br />""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I start my day with a 5 Hour Energy, so having it arrive each month on a subscription is the best way to save money!  I order 3 boxes in my subscription and save consistently over store prices."
"I ordered the 5 hour energy drink,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8"">5-Hour Energy -  Berry 1.93-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> the order process is so simple, I think 3 clicks and done. the product was promptly dispached and I received it a few days later. Just fantastic"
"5-hour Energy is a product we've found to work well for our needs. Better than coffee without the added fluids which is a huge plus when driving. We get ours auto shipped through Amazon, which makes the process very easy."
Kick in the ass. I love 5 hour energy and this is 5 hour energy on roids.  Will definately keep buying.
"I initially tried this product just to see what the buzz was about not to mention that the company spends so damn much advertising it. I assumed it was sort of like another cup of coffee to pick you up, and believed it was hyped way too much.<br />I was wrong on this one as the product must contain a different type of caffeine because it really picks you up without any side effects.<br />I like to fill my morning with exercise of some sort, but many days I just don't have the desire or energy to get started on the exertion. A half bottle of this will get me ""in the mood"" within minutes.<br />I just would not have believed that how much brighter my day will look with a little exercise and a half bottle of this stuff. Almost too good to be true.<br />I have read other reviews for this product and some people just don't get the same boost, so I can only suggest that you try a half bottle just to see if it does as much for you as it does for me."
"While it doesn't always work for five hours, this energy drink works well for me.  I've tried other energy drinks but they don't work as fast or last as long as 5 Hour Energy.<br /><br />It takes a while to get accustomed to the taste.  I probably would not drink this for the flavor alone.  Grape seems to taste the best."
"I've tried several energy products, both drinks and pills, and 5-hour energy is my favorite.  It certainly gives me a kick of energy but doesn't leave me jittery or anxious at all. It is convienent to use and take with me.  I usually keep me with me, one at home, and one in the office in case I hit a mid-day slump. I don't recommend it for any type of weight loss product but if you take it before you hit the gym, you'll get a boost for your workout. I can't take it after about 3:00pm though or I can't sleep at night (around 10pm). I like the pomegranate flavor, but can't stand the Berry flavor."
"I used to head to my local gas station and purchase the individual bottles at almost 3 bucks a piece. A friend told me that she buys them off amazon and they come out to half price! You can't beat that! I only like to drink energy shots when I am in NEED of a quick pick me up. I dislike having to take red bull, monster and all those drinks because of their size and high sugar content. I like the 5 hour drink because at 2 ounces and 4 calories, and no sugar, I can easily and conveniently throw it back and get on with my agenda. However, it does NOT last 5 hours, not for me at least. I drink it 20 minutes before an activity and I can get through it just fine, but maybe 2 hours or so tops. I'm satisfied with it, because that's normally all I need."
A great value. Almost a $20 savings if I bought them individually.I have suggested this deal to all my friends.
"I do like Rockstars, I'll admit, but I don't think you can beat these 5 hour energies.  They just do their job without jacking you up high then crash low.  I like Grape the best, the others are a bit faker tasting.  I would have given 5 starts, but truthfully the fake sugar is nasty, but it's over in a few seconds or just get a water chaser.  I'm sure they'd be super nasty without fake sugar and real sugar makes you crash - can't have it both ways.  It's nice to have a stock of these in the bottom drawer for times of need.  Beats the hell out of prices at the store."
"I normally don't care for artificially sweetened drinks of any kind, especially odd flavors like orange but this product is actually quite tasty. The effects can vary. I find that 1/2 a bottle isn't enough But a full bottle causes me to get jittery. All together though its worth the price"
"I've started using 5-hour energy pretty regularly (2 days a week or so).  I have a newborn and a 2-year-old at home, and a job that requires mental alertness, and 5 Hour Energy really does a great job of eliminating my fatigue without making me feel overly-caffeinated.  And then 5 hours later I'm fatigued again - but no worse that I would have been without it.  As near as I can tell, it's a product with a great benefit, and discernable side effects."
"I love 5 hour energy! I've been using it since last year whn I started working as a package handler in Fedex. Waking up 3am to work at 4am isn't an easy task especially when your used to sleeping in lol whenever I need a boost I drink it. And whenever I need more than a boost I get the extreme one! Lol love it! Recommend it to every1! But one thing everyone should remember, the effect is always different for everyone!"
"As a general rule, I stay clear of energy drinks and drinks with large doses of caffeine in them. However, there are occasions that I need some pep to keep me going - most often when I happen to be working a double shift or am required to work security during the night after just working that same day. In cases like those, 5-hour energy has helped me stay alert for the duration of my assignments. As the product states, there doesn't seem to be any ""crash"" after its effects wear off, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />In the past, I've just purchased these energy drinks at convenience stores, but since I have a lot of double shift days coming up, I opted to purchase an entire case this time around. The price is much more econimical when buying bulk, like this, and the product has a decently long shelf-life (20 months or so), so I'm not worried that I'll be letting some of it expire before I use it.<br /><br />I can't compare this to a lot of other similar products, because - as I stated above - I don't use them frequently, and this is the only energy drink I have ever used. Because it works for me, I don't see any need to try other products, such as Red Bull or Monster, etc."
"5 Hour Energy is an amazing product. It has helped so much when I'm just in need of a little boost. This is so much better to me than the energy drinks since it doesn't give me the crash at the end. On top of how great 5 Hour Energy is, Amazon offers it at such a great price. Very happy customer!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8"">5-Hour Energy -  Berry 1.93-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> I was extremely skeptical about this product until one bottle arrived with another order, as a promotion.  I tend to get very drowsy in the afternoon unless I'm actively engaged in an activity that requires me to move or to talk.  I love to read, but would find myself dropping off to sleep after just a few paragraphs.  This stuff actually wakes me up and gives me energy.  It contains caffeine, but no more than you'd find in a good cup of coffee.  It is NOT full of sugar, and has only 4 calories per bottle.  In addition to caffeine, the product contains a mixture of B vitamins, which have been shown to create alertness and promote overall health.  You really do begin to feel the effects in just a few seconds.  Also, I've tasted some other flavors, but the ""berry"" is the most palatable."
"My husband cannot live without his 5 Hour, so it is so much more economical to order it by the case!"
"Great Product I personally do not like to drink large cans of energy drinks, so when I started taking these 5 hour energy shots It was exactly what I was looking for. Great Price and product."
"i take this and with  omega 3. i am a writer and have not completed a entire novel until now. this is my secret. and this is so much better than a big red energy drink why?<br /><br />1.absolutely no racing heartbeat or too wired like redline.<br />2.absolutely no crash. a perfect combo of natural caffine<br />3.amazing joyful upbeat do anything feeling.all the time.<br />4.please follow the bottle.i learn the hard way. 1 bottle a day not 2.<br />5.combine these with nlp or another motivation technique and its been my cure all.just feeling great<br />6. i have been battleing the mild ""blues"" all my life until about 3 weeks ago.<br />TC-"
"Great product, but this is only for one box. Costco sells these for 32.00 all over for a CASE (two boxes) which brings the price down to 1.33 each, well worth it!"
"VERY effective first time: i pulled an all-nighter and drank this to stay up in class.  I opened it and it smelled really TOXIC but i chugged it down. It only took me 3 minutes or so to become fully alert despite having had no sleep for more 30 hours.<br /><br />i've used it several times since then for all-night studying but i'm not sure why but the impact has slightly decreased every time. also, remember that it keeps you up but that doesn't mean that your attention span will be better.<br /><br />All being said, I would still use it but not very frequently--only when I need to.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)"
"I was at Sam's Club one day and this lady had her entire cart filled with these... Of course, I had to see why she was clearly obsessing over it. So I bought a few... I tried one later that night, when I was starting to feel tired. It sort of tasted like cough medicine. I tried one, nothing happened... I tried another, nothing happened. After waiting 1 hr. I finally went to bed. It took a little longer than usual but was easily able to fall asleep...<br /><br />IT DID NOTHING FOR ME<br /><br />I realize caffeine etc. effects people differently but I did not notice any difference. However, if I drink a can of Mt. Dew I feel the effect rather fast..."
Awesome Quick shipper and good price highly recommend them happy Happy joy joy get some of this wu Hu yee ha wowie
"Like everything, some things work for some and some things don't. For a while it seemed to help me pretty quickly with the alertness, waking me up, and energy. I bought a few boxes and over the period of about 3 months used them on and off. To me they lost their effect quite quickly. I am not sure whether I got used them, whether it was in my head and never really worked (don't think this is the case), or whether they just stopped working...in my head. In the end I decided if it wasn't working for whatever reason, then why put it in my body.<br />  One last thing, I bought this flavor due to the lower price, but in my opinion the grape is much better tasting and not as bitter as this one."
Good stuff.  Works more like 3-4 hours for me .  Same as you get in the gas station only 1/2 the price.
Basically 5hr energy is a huge dose of vitamin B. Orange is the best flavor I think. This is a good price and it gets here fast and free with Amazon Prime.
"These come in really handy when you need an extra ""push"" to get things moving. Average price is $2-3 per bottle. Sometimes you can get a deal on bulk, but for the money, the Dollar Tree stores carry Stacker 2's for $1/bottle and they are just as effective. Just FYI. Can get costly is you're a heavy user."
"I use 5 hour energy as a replacement for coffee because coffee was irritating my throat and eliminated the desire to drink coffee<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8"">5-Hour Energy - Berry, 1.93-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>"
This product saved my life... I was driving back to Las Vegas from LA and could not keep my eyes opened... I was drifting to sleep... I pulled into a Gas Station to take a nap... Went inside and bought my very first bottle... Within minutes I was refreshed... This product works... and the prices on Amazon are great... I paid 3 times as much for my first bottle...
"I used to take 5 hour energy shots on occasion, but the price just really made it not worth it.  It's amazing to think about how much money you spend per month/year if you're taking these on a daily basis.  Also, after doing some research, a lot of the feeling that you think you're getting from 5 hour energy is just a b-vitamin-induced rush, not anything real or long lasting, so I don't like that.<br /><br />If I was getting these for free, I'd be using them... but in terms of stuff I spend money on, I now take <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, which is literally 90% cheaper than these shots.  Every since finding the Good Morning Pill, I've made it my mission to try to talk other people out of wasting their money on more expensive energy products.  In the past I've also taken <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3WFFG"">iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill, Tablets, 84-Count Bottle</a> which seemed to work well enough too."
"Tried these on a whim, after seeing them at gas stations for all these years. The Berry taste took a week to get used to, but now I thoroughly enjoy them.<br /><br />It's hard to say if these specifically perk me up and get me going like a caffeine pill, but I do believe they keep me from being exhausted. I guess I'd speculate that instead of elevating you, they keep you at a constant level, whatever level you happen to be at one you drink one. If you're already tired, IDK how much these would work.<br /><br />Keep in mind the following after reading the above: I have, in my 30 years on this planet, taken far more caffeine than is recommended. I consider myself very tolerant of its affects now. My MD told me to stop taking so much caffeine because it was damaging my kidneys. This probably doesn't help, but it (hopefully) isn't as bad a straight dose of No-Doze."
"Shipped promptly, it is factory wrapped in clear plastic, then amazon shipped in their box.Alot cheaper then buying at store. I would recommend this to anyone looking for 5 hour cheap. I bought two boxes and use onee almost everyday when I need that energy to get me back to normal working speed."
"For two nights in a row, I had gotten hardly any sleep. The family dog had to go out, someone tried to break into the house, and a major thunderstorm were the things I can remember that kept me from sleeping through the night. I was up late during the night trying to accomplish some late night writing and it all caught up with me. I had a long commute home and I was driving alone. Even with the radio up and the windows cracked blowing in the cold winter air, I didn't want to take any chances. So, when I pulled into a gas station for some gas for the car, I picked up this POMEGRANATE 5 HOUR ENERGY drink.<br /><br />I don't like energy drinks. Most of them taste awful and give me what feels like a combination of indigestion, heart burn, and acid reflux all combined. I've drunk some in the past, but only a few taste ok and seem to work. I usually try to stick with tea or cappuccino, but on this particular evening the coffee machine was on the fritz and iced tea didn't sound good in the winter weather. So, I opted for this POMEGRANATE 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK.<br /><br />I was really surprised. The drink tasted great and didn't have any sort of nasty aftertaste. There was some sweetness to the flavor. Not only that, but about 3-5 minutes after drowning the bottle in one gulp, I felt it kicked in. It was about 5pm and I didn't feel tired until just after 9pm. From now on, if I need a pick-me-up that will last, I'm going to use the 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK."
These things are the best for long nights of last minute homework! Its so nice not having to get an upset stomach after drinking a whole pot of coffee. Instead one little bottle and im good for hours! I think this is the best product out there for energy.
"5Hour shots are the right amount of energy i need after lunch! When i feel lazy after my meal, and would like to take a rest, i just take a 5Hour shot and i got the power to work for the rest of the day! =)"
it arrived on time and the quality is good as i expected. i will purchase again and recommend to other people.
"Don't take a long drive without it, it's a life saver and not just yours!<br />Found it takes about 10 - 15 mins to get into system.<br /><br />Told my Doctors I was taking it and I have Diabetes, it doesn't cause a problem."
I drink a 5 hour energy 2-3 times per week when I need the boost to make it to the end of the day and sometimes to get my day started.  I like the 5-hour energy over coffee.  Coffee tends to let me crash and the 5 hour does not.
great prices i order from here 2 times a month ..i trust amazon a lot and they have fast service and great service and these energy drinks are new..
amazon can be trusted good price's and fast service i really like ..this the best place to order from i get my energy drinks from two times a month
"Can't go wrong with the clean energy of 5-Hour. It's our caffeine boost of choice. There are many flavors and we like them all, but pomegranate is our favorite, though we always just buy whichever costs the least."
"Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the ""5-hour ENERGY"" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing."
"I used to be totally against energy drinks. I thought they were a scam to get people to placebo themselves into a state of awakeness. Then one day, walking the streets of SF, I was handed a complimentary sample of 5-Hour Energy. I threw it into my bag thinking that I'd never use it. A couple weeks later, I was having a hard day and knew I was going to have a long night, so I figured why not try the freebie, it didn't cost me anything anyway.<br /><br />Oh My Gosh it worked so well! It was amazing. I guess I'm more sensitive to it because 1/3 of the bottle kept me going for hours. So I decided it was worth it to buy a dozen so it's cheaper per unit, and I could just store it for my long days.<br /><br />I've tried Berry and Pomegranate, definitely like the Berry flavor much better.<br />Cheers!"
"I have enjoyed these ever since they came out.  I agree with another reviewer - do not take all of the time or your body will start to adjust and get used to it.  I keep in the refridgerator as I like them even better when they are cold.  As far a pricing, I am a prime member so I do not pay shipping.  I have never seen a lower price on these at any store!"
"Both my girlfriend and I use these, not everyday but those days when you know you need something to help get you going or days when we work overtime. I have to say they do work, some days we split one to save a little more but I have to say they do work, I asked my doctor if they were safe and he said sure when used in moderation as with everything else. The plus side is you do get a boost of vitamins that you dont when drinking coffee. When we started buying them it was at the local convenience store but at $3-$4 each it was getting expensive. Found them in a local Sams Club for like $39.99 + local tax for a case of 24 and started buying there but that makes it $42.39 for a case. It was nice to see them on amazon Subscribe n Save auto shipment for about $38.xx so almost saving another $5. Nice thing is we have it setup where we get another case right before the previous runs out. Thanks Amazon. One thing I would like is for amazon to offer the pomegranate in the subscribe and save but thats all."
"Works wonders for me when I first started taking them, after that it was harder to get that quick, long lasting buzz.  My suggestion:  Don't use everyday, drink lots of water on the side."
This stuff is wonderful. I even talked to my pharmacy about it and they thought it was full of vitamins and fine to drink. I talked to my doctor about it and told her how it made me feel better. She said that she couldn't recommend it-since she is my doctor but she said it was full of vitamins and thought it was fine to be taking it. I am nervous about taking things over the counter so I wanted to double check with the my pharmacist and doctor. I now drink a whole bottle  each morning when I get to work. It works great for me. I have more energy and feel more positive. I have a SI Joint pain at the moment due to an injury and this has help me through it. I like the grape flavor. In my opinion this is a terrific product-not like sugar that your crash shortly after.
"After hearing some much about 5 Hour Energy, I decided to give it a try by ordering it from Amazon.  I was very pleased with this product.  It actual helped me get through mh daily cardio work out and gave me the energy I needed at 3 o'lock when I start to get sleepy.  Love the product!"
"Having purchased these retail, its great to be able to purchase in bulk, and have it delivered.  Started using 5 Hour back in the spring, and its great.  Good pickme up, but more importantly, you don't suddenly crash in a few hours.  Works for me on the golf course, and at work, when the day goes a LOT longer than you expected."
"Good, clean energy without the crash from other caffeinated drinks. This is our favorite flavor, but most all of them are good, so we just get the best priced flavor."
"The 5-Hour Energy is great!!  It helps keep me alert without any adverse effects.<br />The price was right, shipping was prompt, and I'm very happy with my Amazon Purchase."
"this product not only gives you energy (not in a burst, but subtly); i find that it clears the morning cobwebs from my head.  it is not habit forming and the new flavors are really good.  don't buy this in a store, though, because it is prohibitedly expensive."
"This product works well for energy levels. I really like the price from Amazon, much cheaper than at the convenient stores. The taste could be a little better though."
"It doesn't make me shaky. Energy last sometimes more than 5 hours. It can make my stomach slightly upset without food, but it is well worth the advantages that I receive."
"I love 5hour Energy. It works just like it is advertised; feel it in minutes, last for hours. I work 15 hour days 6 days a week and a 5hour about 2/3 thru the day keeps me going strong. Definitely recommend Berry or Pom."
"I will not say I am addicted to 5 hour energy but I have used it quite a bit this summer. I have never been a coffee drinker and don't like the energy drinks I've tried (Red Bull, Monster, etc.) I am a cabinet builder and installer and have never had a busier summer so I found myself putting in long hours. I couldn't believe the first time I tried this that I could actually feel myself ""waking up"" in the first 5 to 10 minutes. I have done a lot of research on any possible side affects of this stuff and found that it really is safe, if not abused of course. Amazon has the best price that I have found.<br />I prefer the pomegranate over the Orange but it's a little more expensive. The Orange isn't bad , besides I'm not drinking it for the taste!<br />I love it!!"
This stuff really works! I wouldn't be able to get through my 30 hour shift without a bottle of this! So light too!
"I'm not sure any of these can be considered ""good"" tasting, but I like the Lemon-Lime better than the other flavors.  Helps to keep them cold, of course, but sometimes you just have to plug your nose and down it.  It works for me, but I don't use them on a regular basis.  I mostly just have some on-hand for those slow, dragging days when I knew I needed to get something done.  Decided buying in bulk on Amazon was better than paying gas station prices."
"Like most of the reviews posted here, I give this product a positive rating. For me, it does what it claims to do... and I especially appreciate the ""no crash"" effect after a few hours! I first found out about this product when I started racing Go-Karts this year... I hit the local Stop-N-Shop before getting to the track and decided to plunk out the $3.00, as I was a bit tired. I threw it in my cooler and then drank it just prior to my qualifying session. Almost immediately, I could feel the ""boost""... and it helped out on track! I never felt the Niacin rush that some claim, but the one thing I did notice, was that my jaw was a bit tight due to the jolt of energy. I only have few suggestions: I've tried all the flavors, and I think the Orange flavor is the best; I drink the product chilled... tastes better to me that way; the flavor is a bit too sweet for me so I add it into my personal water bottle; I buy this on amazon because it's a lot cheaper than buying it at my local Stop-N-Shop!"
"This is a really great product. I am currently in college and at times I just cant get motivated to do my school work and at times I am too tired. Regardless of exercise and a healthy diet sometimes I still need a little help. When I use this product, it works really fast and there is no after burn or crash from the product. I usually feel more alert also. I would highly recommend this product to any one who made need a little extra push to get through the day!"
"Good for short burst of energy especially for long drives.  I could not tell any difference in the ""extra"" from the regular 5-hour."
"So I'm the kind of person that hates getting up in the morning. I get tired, groggy, uncomfortable, and begin to doze off again if I sit down for too long. I get pretty tired throughout my day too, especially in the afternoons. So, when I heard about Five Hour Energy I simply HAD to try it. I had never drunk a lot of caffeine before, and I wasn't too thrilled about it being in this stuff in the first place, but I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />I read online that some people need a whole bottle to feel any effects but that some people only need a teaspoon. So, I started by drinking 1/4 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. Still tired, still unhappy. So I upped it to 1/2 bottle in the morning: NOTHING. I had read somewhere that it tends to work better on an empty stomach, so I tried it first thing when I got up in the morning: NOTHING. I was really hesitant to drink a whole bottle and consume all of that caffeine, so I thought maybe it would work better for me in the afternoon. I tried a half bottle when I got home: NOTHING. I finally decided I would drink a whole bottle in the afternoon thinking all that caffeine had to do something: NOTHING. My next thought was to take a whole bottle in the morning, but after eating something as that helps lessen the chances of having a niacin flush from it: NOTHING. Disappointed, I wad down to the last resort: having it in morning AND on an empty stomach: BINGO! Within five minutes, I was awake, refreshed, and ready to start the day! It was one of the most amazing feelings I've ever experienced; being awake in the morning felt SO good.<br /><br />Needless to say, I now LOVE Five Hour Energy. I feel awake and alert in the mornings whenever I take it. However, I limit myself to 4 bottles per week, as I don't want to get hooked on caffeine or become dependent on the stuff. The only problem (and the reason this is not a 5 star rating) is because it only works in the MORNING and on an EMPTY stomach. I wish I could use it any time during the day but it just doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />If you're hesitant to try it, don't be! Go into your local drugstore and pick up a small pack and try it out. Experiment with different amounts at different times during the day. It seems to work really well for some but not at all for others, so the only way you're going to know if it works for you is by trying it yourself.<br /><br />And there is no crash like the bottle states: it wears off slowly, and if you're moving around all day anyways then you'll wake yourself up naturally by the time it truly wears off. It's great for students who need to stay up late to study, although I've never tried to use it after pulling an all-nighter. You probably need at least a couple of hours of sleep in order for it to work.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best prices for this stuff in large quantities. You can get a 12-pack here for around $1.80 a bottle, which is really good. Flavor-wise, grape is my favorite, but I've tried most of them. The grape seems to have the least bitter taste; it's pretty sweet. The Lemon-Lime is really sour/bitter and the orange has a really potent 'orange-flavored-medicine' taste. Berry is my second favorite, but I'm eager to try the pomegranate.<br /><br />So PLEASE, if you're considering trying this stuff, DO!"
"This is the best stuff, it may not make you crazy with energy, but your focus and general energy is elevated for hours."
"5-hour energy does what is promised.  If you are looking for the nervous, jittery, and overall anxious feeling, this is not the drink.  Plus with no hard crash, this is the best out there."
"I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc). But all of them made me jittery and made me feel uneasy, even before an intense workout. I go to the gym at 5:30AM everyday and take one of these on the way out the door. As soon as I get halfway to the gym, I cannot wait to hit the weights! Now sometimes I will add a sugar free Red Bull on leg day, but one of these usually does the trick on regular days. I love this stuff. I hate the feeling most pills and drinks give me. This stuff just makes me feel alert."
"I'm a college student who needs all the extra energy I can get. 5- Hour Energy really gives me the boost I need with out any ""crash"". Berry and Orange flavors taste great. I highly recommend to everyone."
This product works great to give you that initial push you sometimes need to get moving without any jittery feelings or crash later.  I only use 1/2 of the bottle at a time and the no refrideration needed makes it handy to keep in the car and drink on the way home from work when you have a lot you need to accomplish at home.  Love it!
"I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days.  Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the ""drop"" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right?"
"This stuff really works, and it's cheaper and better than Red Bull, Monster, or any of the other energy drinks.  It lasts longer, there's no crash, and no sugar.  I drink one every morning instead of coffee, and the best thing is, it actually tastes pretty good.  Highly recommended to start your day."
"I was not sure this product would live up to the ads, but it gave me the energy boost I needed when I needed it when I had to work the overnight shift."
"Definitely a great deal, can't get a pack of 5 hr energy cheaper anywhere else. Came promptly and lasted me a good while, will definitely be buying more from this vendor again."
"My sister started to use this during inventory time's long shifts.  Her triglycerides were sky high before she started her half a bottle, not even every day. When she went back to her doctor, her level had dropped from over 400 to right around 200!  On no medications!  Her doctor says it's due to the niacin.  She told me about the energy boost, since I have Parkinson's Disease and between that & the medications, it was hard to keep up with work.  I love it!  And at these prices I can afford it!"
"Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the ""5-hour ENERGY"" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either. I'm so very pleased that they created this product (just for folks like me)! Try some for yourself soon, and see what you've been missing."
This was a great order.  The unit price was right around $1.60 which is much cheaper than you can purchase them for retail.  The package arrived unharmed the next business day and the product was undamaged and unopened.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and will likely purchase this item again in the future.
"Product is exactly like the boxes you see in the stores, comes in individually sealed containers.  Pomegranate is the only flavor of Five Hour Energy that doesn't taste like butt.  Great pick-me-up for those dragging work days!"
"I'm a night owl with a 8-4 job that is preceeded by a 1-hour commute, that often gets stuck on call during the late hours simply because my supervisor knows I'll be awake. So sleep is a coveted prize.<br /><br />I originally was drinking Monster energy drinks. While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel. I tried coffee as an alternative, and that was a guarentee for a rebellious stomach, and the stuff usually took a good hour to really have effect no matter how strong I made it.<br /><br />I stumbled onto 5-hour energy when hiding in a 7-11 during a sudden downpour on my walk to the office, and figured, ""Eh, why not."" I'd seen a few commercials, but kinda just wrote it off - primarily because I utterly hated that their early commericals were almost entirely a smear against other alternatives. I chugged it, then headed back on my walk once it was clear.<br /><br />I was awake and alert by the time I got to the office, and I'd only downed half the bottle. I was expecting an aftershot later from my stomach (I really have a touchy one), with only a very minor reaction from it.<br /><br />Big thing that hit me, was the price they slap on them Downtown; this 12 pack was the answer to that. Especially since I will easily go through them all.<br /><br />I very definitely recommend them."
I start every morning with a quick shot of this. I hate drinking coffee in the warmer months so this gets me my caffeine fix.
"I am an Assistant Secretary/Computer TA at a Pre-K/K school and I used to be almost constantly yawning the last couple hours of the day.  I kept seeing these little 5 hour Energy Shots at the local Wal-Mart checkout counters and finally tried one.  NO MORE yawning!  One of these little bottles and I do NOT feel sleepy until the five hours are up!  Depending on when I take one, it sometimes works a little longer.  Now I keep a stash (of every flavor) in my desk drawer for emergencies and I LOVE it!  HIGHLY recommended!!"
"This tastes great and is truly effective. I drank half a bottle every few hours everyday during finals week and was able to pound out those practice exams one after another--all day, baby! The best part is that there is no (sudden) crash like there would be after a sugar rush. The fatigue does catch up to you though, but not for a while and definitely not suddenly. I wouldn't advise drinking this first thing in the morning, though, like I did. Although you get a sudden jolt of energy, your stomach might be upset the rest of the day. It's best used to overcome that afternoon drowsiness, or to stay up late."
Doesn't give you the jitters and doesn't tast bad either.  Prefer this over the sweet drinks that you have to drink over 8 oz
"Quick shipping, good price, exactly what I paid for.  I'm definitely not a morning person, but these definitely do the job.  I hate coffee and these definitely don't taste ""good"", but they are easy enough to take down.  It's not like you're trying to shoot a bottle of cough syrup, it's really not that bad.  Kind of tart/tangy but it gets the job done.  Good product."
"This stuff is wonderful, but I wonder if the name scares people off. When I use this, it feels like a cloud is being lifted from my brain. The effect is more like a good night's sleep than an shot of cappuccino. I have more energy, but it is in the form of more alertness, not bouncing off the walls. I used to struggle through meetings, especially after lunch, but a shot of 5-hour energy gets me through easily. I've not noticed any negative affects. I wouldn't drink this just for the flavor, but it is tolerable."
"They do work, and don't taste too bad<br /><br />Only complaint and reason I didn't give 5 stars is they are expensive little buggers; wish these things would come down in price."
"I was a coffee and caffeine fiend until I found this stuff. Works faster, better, and is arguably more affordable. No preparation required, just keep it in your car, backpack, etc and it goes down warm or cold. What more does one need for a serving of wake-up-juice?<br /><br />On sleepy days I drink half a bottle around 10am and the other half after lunch. It can dehydrate you a little so I'd suggest making a mental note of your hydration status when using. I don't notice or have any side effects, except I can sit at the computer all day doing my job without having to try and stay awake!"
"Up and up. I remember when this was 19 or 21 dollars. In a matter of months, it's near 27 bucks. While I enjoy the product and would like to buy in bulk, I'm going to have to stop."
"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR. I HAVE TRIED BERRY, ORANGE, GRAPE AND LEMON LIME.  I GREW TIRED OF BERRY.  LEMON LIME HAS A MUCH LIGHTER TASTE.  SO FAR AS I CAN DISCERN,  ALL FLAVORS WORK JUST AS WELL.  I ONLY USE ONE HALF OF A BOTTLE PER DAY.  I TAKE IT IN THE MORNING ON MY WAY TO CLASS.  IT TRULY GIVES ME A  MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BOOST.  I PREFER IT TO COFFEE AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE  A MUCH LONGER EFFECT AS ITS NAME IMPLIES.  GOOD STUFF."
"I am an ex barista who worked at Starbucks over a decade ago, and have been a slave to coffee for many years. I have found that the 5 Hour Energy Extra Strength Berry Flavored not only stimulates me better, but it lasts longer too!"
I keep a box in the pantry.  Helps me from snacking all the time and now I found that it even helps me get over a nasty flu symptoms.  The real benefit for me it that I'm insulin dependent diabetic so I'm very limited as to what I can consume without drug interactions.  And this product doesn't cause any interaction problems.  And there isn't any crash problems or sugar rushes that other products cause.  I'm back looking to by my 4th case of this product!  It's a great pick-me up when traveling or just feeling drained.  I never make a driving trip with out one in the car!
"So you may have seen the cheesy commercials for these energy drinks and never thought twice that they may actually work, they do! These energy drinks give you the energy/caffeine boost you are looking for without a crash and without those jittery feelings you may get with other energy products. I like to drink one of these in the afternoon in lieu of coffee to help me get through the work day! The Berry flavor is pleasant as well."
"I don't do a lot of reviews, but I just had to say that this stuff works for me.<br /><br />From traveling long distances on boring highways to staying clear in the head while writing a book to reading boring stuff, it just keeps me engaged in the activity at hand.<br /><br />It seems to get me past the big lunch sleepy-time that follows...<br /><br />Give it a try.  (I have no financial interest in your doing so... except that it keeps the product in production so I can get more when I want to! :)<br /><br />Keep smiling,<br />Ron"
"I usually drink half, wait an hour or so, and finish the bottle. The biggest advantage for me is that I'm not running to the restroom as often with this as with coffee or tea. I bought this with Amazon's Subscribe & Save which is the best price I've seen anywhere.  I don't drink this everyday, but only when I need help staying awake in a boring class or for a homework assignment."
"This shot works like a charm, and tastes SO good- like doing a shot of kool-aid! Also true that there really is No Crash. Feel great!"
"I had heard good things from my friends about 5-hour energy, and I really needed a boost one day after school. I had a couple hours of jujitsu training that day, and I was in desperate need of a wake-up. I walked a couple miles home and on my way, I stopped and grabbed a 5-hour energy. I took it at 3:30, and by 4:45 (when training class started) I felt great. I went through the 2 hours of training just fine, but what really surprised me was that I still had a TON of energy after that. I really felt the need to burn that energy, so at 7:30 I decided to go for a run.<br />A while later, I realized that I just run 5 miles.<br />The energy wasn't an intense sugar high either. It just felt like I could run and never stop. I probably could have gone even further if my leg muscles were in better shape (I usually don't run very long distances).<br />This product did what it advertised and was WAY better than I expected.<br />Will definitely buy again."
"I won't spend a bunch of time repeating what others say - just reiterate - If you need constant energy boosts, you probably have some vitamin deficiency or a job that isn't providing enough enriching growth and fulfillment (too deep?) but if I have to slug through a few hours, this stuff works for me.<br /><br />It kind of just refreshes my perspective, not really boosts like i'm going to run a mile. I feel it less nervous than I do from a can of Monster Low-Carb.  Does make my heart beat a little more noticeable - which to me just screams ""DO SOMETHING instead of sitting here watching TV or typing amazon reviews"".<br /><br />It has sucralose in it (as does Monster Low Carb) which i think stinks. i'd rather just have a few grams of sugar than artificial anything so i don't drink it too often (though the sucralose is probably minimal since it's not a big drink) - on a side note - check out Xylitol from birch (not corn) if you want a supposed awesome alternative to sugar and sweeteners. Tastes just like sugar, comes like white sugar but none of the bleaching. No insulin issues, no tooth decay. on and on benefits and all natural.<br /><br />Back to the 5 hour - well, i like the berry flavor the best, so I buy that one.  the rest are tolerable to me with a slight eye squint of sweetener at the end of the glup - reminds me of Smarties candy from Halloween.<br /><br />Tried a few others and this one seems to work well for me without the cracky jitters.  Never done more than 1 in a day though."
"No shakes or quakes! This is exactly like having a cup of joe, and will cost you less! Two gulps of 5 Hour makes the rest of my day a breeze. I usually have it near 3 in the afternoon and I get more done in the 5 hours than I would in three days. Seriously. This stuff is not dangerous, rather it makes your days productive. Need to exercise? Got to make dinner for the kids? They need help with homework? No problem. And you'll have extra energy for whatever else floats your boat!"
"I have only used this product 2 different times in the past 8 months, and both times, I drank the whole bottle of it. It's probably not a good idea to do at first, maybe start out with half of the bottle, until you know how it will affect you, but I wanted to see what it would do.  For me, this was more like the 10 Hour Energy drink both times. I can drink a bottle of it in the early afternoon, and within about 15 minutes, I am very alert, and awake, and feeling very good with more than plenty enough of energy. If I drink a bottle, say around 2pm, I am still feeling the effects of it, even up to as late as 9pm or 10pm. The best part about it is, there is no crashing feeling when it starts to wear off. This will affect each person differently, so experiment with it, accordingly.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have with it, is that it makes my heartbeat, race. Not so much that it makes me want to panic, but I notice a real hike in my heart rate after about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Contains caffeine and other powerful ingredients. This isn't your typical cup of coffee with caffeine that wears off in 2 or 3 hours, this is powerful stuff, so please follow the directions and DO NOT drink more than prescribed, otherwise, you're liable to find yourself running circles on your ceiling.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody that needs a good boost of energy to make it through the afternoon. But as I stated, respect it, use it accordingly, and you should have no problems."
"I think people either love or hate 5-hour energy. IF you're here then you probably love it and as i was, looking for the cheapest place to buy 5hour in bulk.<br /><br />gave it 5stars because 5hour is awesome. The energy feels clean compared to energy drinks and coffee. There really isn't any other way to explain it.<br /><br />I know its against guidelines to talk about price, but this 12-pack of pomegranate was the cheapest at the time. 19 or so with free shipping. IF anyone finds cheaper, PLEASE leave a comment with link to item."
i just tried 2 bottles so far. my first i took halves and lasted 10+ hours. i waited near 72 hour mark before drinking the last half and it was really weak. my guess w/e is in 5 hour degrades over time when open because my second bottle gave me the boast as when i first opened my first bottle. when i take it keeps me focused unlike any energy drink or coffee i drank except for cocaine energy drink but that like drinking acid and feel like your gonna die. I only had berry it not sweet mostly bitter and the taste lingers in mouth long after you drink it this is only downside of 5 hour of energy and berry taste. Also i got that burning feeling in my veins the first time i taken this but that caused by one of vitamin Bs
"5-hour Energy works, and the best part is, you don't feel at all shakey or ""antsy,"" and your heart doesn't seem to race. All I feel is energetic.<br /><br />I can't say it tastes all that great, but since it gives you the pep you need on those days when you don't seem to have the energy to get things done, it's well worth the taste. I've also found I don't have to drink much of it, about 1/3 of a bottle works just fine unless I'm particularly tired.<br /><br />Just one word of caution. I'd advise you not drink it before breakfast -- before you've eaten anything on any given day. I did this only once, and I felt a bit weak and nauseous.<br /><br />However, I now use the 5-hour energy drink fairly often, and as long as I drink it after eating just a little breakfast, or any time during the day after that, I've felt nothing but energetic."
Great if you need energy!  I use this product daily and it keeps me going with my extremely high-stress job!
"I've only tried these a couple of years ago and don't remember my experience. This semester I have an advanced college class from 5pm to 10pm every Wednesday and it's after a couple hours of work and another class. I usually drink coffee in the morning so I don't want to push it and drink more before a long class late in the day.<br /><br />I ordered the 12 pack of Pomegranate last week and yesterday just before class I drank my 1st bottle. Within two minutes I was actually feeling more alert and energized. I'm a 22 year old guy who's somewhat active but not exactly in shape, and this made me feel like going out and exercising even though I had been rushing around most of the day. I would say the effects lasted past the 5-hour mark as I was still feeling awake and alert around midnight (7 hours after drinking a full bottle). Of course results will vary but mine excellent on the first try. I'll update next week or anytime thereafter if I have any negative or interesting effects.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-10-2011:<br />I held out and didn't try another bottle until my Wednesday class came around again and I had the same effects as last week. I was alert and able to enjoy the class while others were fatigued from the long day. I ended up staying awake until 4am and I'm not sure if that was because of the 5 Hour Energy but I don't usually stay up after 1am if I have work the following day, so beware if you're interested in this for late night applications."
Tastes very good! Drinking one will give me energy for MORE than five hours and it's best to take in the morning. Much better than having to drink an entire energy drink.
"I love 5 hour energy.  It makes sense that some will enjoy the effects and other will not, as we all react differently.  I also agree that it has a decreasing return, even moreso than you experience with caffiene.  So one a day is plenty, and anything after that just gives you heartburn.  My only gripe is this seller's long shipping time.  I love amazon prime because of the 2-day shipment (otherwise I'd just go to the store), but, as this isn't fulfilled by amazon, it has taken over a week to actually receive the product."
I LOVE 5 HOUR ENERGY I THINK THE ORANGE IS THE BEST FLAVOR BUT HARD TO FIND SO I ORDERED A CASE...
"I am a big fan of this product.  I love the grape flavor, but you should realize that (at least, right now) you can get the extra strength version for about the same price - just not in grape apparently.<br /><br />There are some knock-offs that probably do the same thing, but there are also similar looking products with an entirely different toolkit of supplements.  I recommend trying this brand at least once.<br /><br />Also, when trying this for the first time, start with just a sip and wait 15 minutes.  If you feel fine, have a bigger sip, working your way to half a bottle.  Once you build a tolerance, you can have up to two bottles a day apparently.  Tolerance seems to fall off after a few days for me.<br /><br />I think if used wisely this is a healthful supplement, and the price is reasonable."
"As a morning person, afternoons are usually not a creatively productive time for me.  I found that when I try to keep going by drinking coffee I sometimes experience drowsiness as though the caffeine has an opposite effect on me.  I tried a few of the different energy drinks and found that 5-Hour works best for me.  The taste is OK, but I'm not drinking it for the taste.  I also like the fact that you don't have to drink a 16 Oz can of fluid.  I don't use it every day but when I need to work into the evening, it keeps me alert, energized, and productive.  There is no after-effect that I can tell.  I fall asleep quickly and get a good night's rest after 5-6 hours.  Results may vary for different people, but this works for me.  The price is a bit steep but you can find pretty good deals if you shop around and buy in bulk."
Does what it says...it's an energy drink but so is coffee.  Unlike coffee you can carry it to class and take it when you need it.
"I like this stuff, it very helps me get through my busy days. The merchant, ""Pro Sports"" is incrediable and has earned my loyalty as a customer"
They keep me awake when I need to be without any side effects - this is my coffee/soda
this has more caffiene and 2000 mg of energy blend... instead of 1870 mg energy blend... I can't tell the difference from regular 5 hour energy but it costs more. it's good though. I think 5 hour energy is the best energy shot available.
"good stuff....no matter how tired I am or how much sleep I didn't get, this gives me an extra boost for the gym"
"I ordered the 5 hour energy drink from Amazon because it is cheaper than buying it one bottle at a time.  This product is great when you need to stay alert for 5 hours.  I have had no jittery, caffeine type effects from it.  It just lets you have 5 hours of non-drowsy time and then it lets you go to sleep.  Very good for people who need to drive at night or do something that requires mental alertness.  Highly recommend it!!"
I've tried a million kinds of energy drinks but these 5-hour energy shots always work the best for me. I have a lower tolerance so I only need half of one of these to get a good effect. They taste pretty good for an energy drink. They are a fruity berry flavor with hints of multivitamin. They last for at least five hours. I'll take them around 7 or 8 pm if I have to stay up studying and sometimes they'll keep me up until 2-3 in the morning.
"I drink red bull, but sometimes I don't want to drink a whole can, so I keep these little bottles nearby and drink one of them.  One gulp and 15 minutes later I feel like I can get up off the couch and do something productive. Easy to take with you because one will fit in your pocket and is ready when you are. Great Product!"
I just had twins in December.  How do I make it through the workday?????  5-hour energy.  Enough said.
5 hour energy give you a kick in the pants...great for a rough day at work!!
Great product.  It tastes fairly good and does give you a nice burst of energy to do what you need to do on a Wednesday (and Thursday)
I was curious and tried this item on Jan 28th.  I bought 2 bottles of the lemon-lime.  The taste is very bad---need to flush it down with a glass of water.  Within about 30 minutes I began feeling very uneasy---sort of had the jitters----didn't have a lot of energy but was very nervous and just could not sit down.  I was afraid it was effecting my heart rate or blood pressure but I checked and both those remained normal even though I felt very uneasy.<br />I tried it a day later with the second bottle---same results.  Very uncomfortable feeling---I will not use it anymore
"Drinking anything that causes headaches should be avoided and prevented.  This drink gave me a whopper and I had to leave work early.  This was given away for free at our company last week, and many were concerned because of potential side effects of sucralose.  I gave it a try, but needed a headache pill and only felt normal - ironically - 5-hours later."
"I primarily use these to prevent a hang over. Since your body gets depleted of most of the vitamins that are in this it gives you an extra BOOST of these vitamins right before I go out for a night of drinking. I can have fun all night long, drink like I'm 18 years old again (and as long as I drink a fair amount of water also) I wake up with absolutely NO hangover whatsoever!!!!!<br /><br />I may feel a lil tired the next day from being out late, but NO hangover!!<br /><br />I've also used these about an hour before I go work out and it gives me an extra little boost to push myself a little harder on the treadmill or when I'm lifting weights.<br /><br />I HAVE experienced the niacin flush that they warn about on the bottle, but it went away within a few minutes. This usually gives me INSTANT ""energy"". It's not really an energy energy perse, but I feel a lot more alert and focused.<br /><br />THERE are THREE main reasons I use these......... 1.) PREVENT hangover  2.) Boost workout  3.) Energy boost<br /><br />I LOVEEEEE it for ALL three! (Especially the preventing a hangover part!"
"Let me just tell you what a great decision 5 hour energy drink made at the corporate level.  As soon as I received my first case I popped open the first bottle and chugged it down. Then I relized they are like pringals, once you pop you can't stop!! I had to contain my self to drink only one every hour.  By the twelfth hour/bottle, I had walked from my house to the UPS facility to grab the second shipment (this one arrived exactly one week later). However, my legs hurt from standing for so long. I am very happy. Thank you corporate at 5 hour energy!"
"There are a couple of uses this product is given at my house.<br /><br />My husband swears by it so much that we actually have the ""Subscribe & Save"" option for it (we get 2 12-packs every month).  He uses them when he's going to go out drinking with his buddies to avoid the next day hangover.  I've tried it for this purpose too but I couldn't vouch for it as much as he does because I've never experienced a real hangover just the occasional headache which I fix with a couple of aspirin.  He did use to get the whole spectrum of the hangover rainbow symptom (vomiting, nausea, headache, sensitivity to light and sound, dizziness, etc).  He swears that ever since he started drinking 5-hour energy before a night of drinking he's reduced his next day symptoms.  I do see him a bit more functional the next day and whether it's a placebo effect or an actual effect of 5-hour energy is disputable of course but I'm not claiming scientific certainty just personal experience.<br /><br />He also uses them in place of coffee when he's in a hurry and doesn't have time to make coffee.  Coffee in our household is more of an enjoyment but of course we do have the little caffeine habit that affects our productivity.  I actually do feel the same replacing one of these for a cup of coffee but nothing bits the deliciousness of a cup of coffee (the flavor of this thing is mediocre at best and absolutely horrendous at worst).  I've actually made the mistake of mixing a cup of coffee with one of these and I did feel jittery but if you just take the 5-hour energy without extra caffeine you should be OK. Of course if you are pretty much immune to caffeine at this point, both products at the same time won't make much of a difference.  I would be careful to drink more than two per day just because of the amount of vitamins contained in it.  You never know what kind of side effects you can get from OD'ing on vitamins.<br /><br />If you can get past the horrible flavor, I'd recommend it, otherwise stick to coffee."
The taste of extra strength is better than regular 5 hour energy but I still question the ability to give ME more energy. Would recommend if you like energy products.
"I remember when this product came to the market, it was dirt cheap at your local gas station. Now that the product has taken off the price has also taken off, it is easily twice as much as it used to be. For the price these things just aren't worth it. You can find alternatives that are just as convenient and work just as well for cheaper.<br /><br />As for the product experience its a mixed bag for me. Sometimes it would wake me up and other times it seemed to be more on the sedating side than the stimulating side. When it did work it was nice and smooth but did not overstimulate me like some other energy supplements/drinks do, I mean who wants the jitters and that nervous feeling in your gut? These did not disappoint when it did work.<br /><br />Positives<br />- convenient<br />- doesn't overstimulate (obviously will if you over do it)<br />- smooth come down<br />- works fast<br /><br />Negatives<br />- varied results, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't<br />- price to benefit ratio isn't that great, in other words they are expensive for what you get..they are like the red bull of energy shots, they may work but they are overpriced for what they are and there are better alternatives out there.<br /><br />Recommendation? If you have some patience when it comes to energy products then pills have the best price to performance ratio, I recommend iSatori Energize or Energy NOW products.<br /><br />If you want something that works faster than pills then I recommend getting the drink mix called ""deton8"" they sell them at Kroger (Smiths) stores and at $2.50-$3 for 10 packets its far cheaper than buying these and works just as well in my opinion."
"I have never been able to tolerate the taste or effects of any energy drink.  I've always gotten jittery after finishing it, or given up after a couple sips because of the gross chemical taste.  I saw this in a gas station on a long road trip where I found my eyes drooping and decided to give it a shot.  I was amazed at the quick results, how suddenly peppy I felt, but without feeling weird.  I've found occasion to use purchase 5 hour energy 2 times since then (in about a month), and again had great results.  I decided to purchase with Amazon since it's so much cheaper, to have these on hand when I need them.  I work full time and go to school at night, and I have PCOS, so there are occasions when my energy gets really sluggish.  I'm thrilled to have these to rely on when it's absolutely necessary.  I definitely don't intend to get in the habit of using them, as I know anything like this isn't really healthy, but they're a lifesaver when really needed.  Oh, and they, like all energy drinks, taste pretty horrible (I've tried berry and orange), however, at only 2 ounces, I can tolerate drinking them and then washing it down with water or something else - thankfully the taste doesn't linger!"
Order was done well and without a problem.  Employees like all of the 5 hour energy.
This is my 3rd or 4th purchase from this company. The price can't be beat and the shipping is extremely fast. Couldn't be happier with my experience.
"This isn't a LOT of sugar/caffeine.<br /><br />It's a LOT of vitamins and some energy blend. It has (supposedly) 200mg of caffeine, which is about as much in a strong cup of coffee. Compare this to the average 45 mg contained in Diet Coca-Cola. I compare this product to Diet Coke because regular Coca-Cola contains enough sugar to obscure the effects of its caffeine.<br /><br />With knowledge of its contents in mind, this product offers a subtle and extended increase in energy. It is clearly an increase in energy, but that doesn't mean that you'll experience anything similar to the energy boost from a sugar high. It's a much more controlled boost in energy.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone who is in generally good health. Even if you don't take it for extra energy, it's probably a good idea to take vitamins every once in a while rather than not taking vitamins at all.<br /><br />Forclosure: The only other energy shot that I tried is the Mountain Dew one...it wasn't worth it. I have consumed more than my fair share of energy drinks, though (rockstar, monster, etc.)."
I figured this would be a good energy shot before my evening workout and it is. After working all day and still needing more exercise this really helps get me through. At first I was amazed at how good it tasted. It reminds me a bit of Kool-aid. Then the aftertaste hit and I thought I was going to die. Fortunately it is small so you can shoot it down and chase it with anything. I'll keep using these as long as I can find more. The pricer here on Amazon also makes them a valuable find.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098214251X"">Build Your Beverage Empire</a><br /><br />5 hour energy shot has the best selling products on the market.

"5-Hour Energy Berry 12 bttls I am 100% satisfied with this product. I drink a cup of coffee before going to bed and I sleep like a baby. I can even drink Red Bull with the same results, There's an energy drink called Cocaine and it does work yet it's not as convient as 5-hour energy. I keep it in my car, my desk and purse. Whenever I start to nod. I just grab a bottle and within minutes I'm good to go 5 hours or longer. My sister called from Florida asking for the name of this enery drink for her husband He now travels with it too."
"Great energy boost from amino acids, vitamin b12, etc. NO crash, NO headache, just a boat load of energy that lowers back to normal without any negative issues.<br />Great price and fast shipping help too."
"This product works if you need some instant motivation, whether or not your sleep deprived."
As advertised this drink gives you a long boost when you need energy and you are out of it. with a very fruity flavor the drink delivers its promises.
"I never drink energy drinks. I'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water. I never got the point of it.But today it was 2 pm I could barely keep my eyes open and i had class from 3:30 till 9:00. I needed energy and fast. Then the commercial for 5-hour energy popped in my head, ""2:30 feeling"" I knew some of my friends used it, so I thought why not give it a try. I figured it was small so it wouldn't do that much harm.<br /><br />I drank half of the bottle and within minutes I know longer felt like I was falling asleep. Unfortunately 10 minutes later I was feeling more tired than before. I decided to drink the rest of the bottle. Once again a quick 5 minute burst of energy and then back to exhaustion. Then everything got worse. Around an hour after drank the drink I found myself doubling over in stomach pain and throwing up. It has been 7 hours since I drank it and I feel like I just got hit by a train. Instead of helping me get through class the 5-hour energy made it nearly impossible."
"I took this stuff and nothing, maybe a little bit more alert other than that , No energy, And let two friend's try it. For them NOTHING also.. Buyer beware!!! "" Buy 1 bottle from wal-mart, before you consider a case."
"I ordered the lemon lime flavor and although it works well to perk me up, it tastes the way lemon floor cleaner smells--hard to swallow without at least a shiver, even after ""getting used to it."" I like the orange flavor better. Much better!"
"I use this to wake up in the morning because I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. It is very convenient to sip in bed, compared to a soda or a pill. I like the extreme version because I only sip it and the extreme lasts longer. I'm somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I never drink a whole bottle. I use the 5-Hour brand instead of the cheaper alternatives because it does have a bunch of chemicals, and I assume they have a lot to lose if something goes wrong, so they probably spend more on quality control.<br /><br />If all you want is energy, caffeine pills are way cheaper. You can get 60-100 for a few bucks. They only give you mental energy though, but 5-Hour gives you physical energy.<br /><br />Someone mentioned green tea. I also recommend matcha green tea. It is a very good low level, long duration energy, but it's also expensive. I won't even mention cocaine - oops just did."
"So yeah, it kept me awake..... Only to give me a huge migraine. Thanks five hour energy... Everyday? How about never... I'm in terrible pain from a QUARTER OF A BOTTLE"
"I tried this for the first time today, but I only managed to drink half of it. It tasted so bad I was afraid I'd vomit."
"Five hour energy is junk.  It tastes awful, doesn't work, and is way overpriced.  Just about anything is a better alternative."
"These things work at first..but after prolonged use the effects are diminishing. After using them almost daily for about a month when my twin girls were born (exhausting work by the way!)...I noticed even though I wasn't eating much I still wasn't losing weight.  I also noticed that after drinking one of these I'd get mood swings too. The web site [...] lists a variety of consumer complaints from Splenda consumption, such as:<br /><br />  Gastrointestinal problems<br />  Migraines<br />  Seizures<br />  Dizziness<br />  Blurred vision<br />  Allergic reactions<br />  Blood sugar increases<br />  Weight gain<br />I'd avoid these all together and stick to coffee!"
"I've been using 5 Hour 1-2-3 days a week for quite sometime now and have had a good experience with it.  However I just came across a new energy shot that I like better called DYNAPEP Energy.  It's an energy shot that comes in a much smaller package that keeps my energy on a higher level for as much as 10 hours and at 46 years old I need all the energy I can get.  It's a lot more convenient to carry, seems to have a longer effectiveness and I seem to like it more than I do the 5 Hour."
"I would consider myself a caffeinated products connoisseur, so of course I've had 5 hour energy before.  But it's not something that I'd consume on a regular basis.<br /><br />It's just ridiculously expensive compared to equally effective products.  Right now I'm taking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A"">Black Friday to Cyber Monday Deal - 50% Off Sale: The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Drinks, Shots, Coffee</a>, which costs like 33 cents per pill, and gives me just as good (or better) energy boost than a ~$2 5 Hour Energy.  I've also taken <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3WFFG"">iSatori Energize All Day Energy Pill, Tablets, 84-Count Bottle</a> in the past and also plain caffeine pills, and either one of those options would also be a fine substitute for 5-hour.<br /><br />Bottom line - if I get one for free I'll drink it, but why take a $2 shot instead of a 33 cent pill?"
"The first thing I noticed was the taste was overwhelming - but I figured that's fine - vitamins usually don't taste terrific.  But afterwards I didn't really have an increase in energy.  Instead, I just felt dehydrated and nauseous.  An overall sick feeling.  Even worse, I actually felt *tired* after a few hours.  It may work for some people, but definitely not all people."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QNJY5K"">5 Hour Energy Orange, 1.93-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> is good but a bit pricey.

Unless the price really goes up, Red Rain is the better buy, but has slightly less quality."
"The happy news:  Wednesday was 100 degrees and I felt exhausted and unable to focus on the 90-mile drive.  Experimented with 1 bottle of Orange at 2 p.m.  It tasted awful.  At first it had no effect, and I did find some relief by pouring water on the back of my neck and back to revive me.  I continued driving and I would say about half-way (45 min) I no longer felt like I had a problem with tiredness or my driving.  At home I was able to complete several errands and continued working into late into the evening.  At 9:15 p.m. I began to feel my usual tired self, then normal drowsing and fell asleep without issue.<br /><br />During the night I awoke feeling like my skin was crawling without anything specific to scratch.  I am guessing that this is a generalized itching sensation from ""niacin flush.""<br /><br />The unhappy news:  Wednesday was also the day the three tornadoes hit Massachusetts so I cannot say for sure whether what happened the days after was from the 5-Hour Energy or from my adrenaline kicking in from pure worry.  I was glued to the TV for several hours watching the weather color maps as the storm systems moved Eastward.  Thankfully our neighborhood was out of range.  On Thursday I woke up and could not get going. It was tiring to do anything but shuffle around, wishing for energy that did not come. Thursday finally wound down in disappointment and Friday came with the same dreaded tiredness that lasted until afternoon when I snapped back into normalcy.<br /><br />So I do not know how to rate the product.  I am leery about experimenting with it further, especially since I am hypothyroid and tend to be tired, though nothing like what I described in the preceding paragraphs."
"IMPORTANT: DRINK PLENTY OF WATER (if you plan on taking this continually) This has 2000% of your daily intake of Vitamin B and, believe it or not, you can overdose on vitamins. Side effects of overdosing? Headache, dizziness, fainting, etc. Just a heads-up, but anyways! On to my review.. :) After reading other reviews, it's obvious that this works differently for everyone. For me, it worked great! I just had it for the first time today (Orange flavor was tolerable, just drink it like a shot so you won't taste it too much) to help me pull an all-nighter to study for a final. It worked immediately, my eyes aren't heavy anymore, and I had a rush of energy to just study, study, study. This is absolutely useful if you need a quick boost as long as it's used in moderation!"
"I really like the 5 hr Energy because it has no caffeine, no sugar and it works.  I like the fact that it has vitamins in it.  It helps get me over the last few hours of work when I start feeling sluggish."
Excellent customer service and I received the item sooner than expected. Price was lower than in stores.
"After reading the other reviews, I was thinking I'd better be careful lest I end up beet red and running around my office like a rat on acid.  Well no problems there.  I tried just half a bottle and felt no different.  Tried a whole bottle and kept waiting for the ""afterburner"" to kick in.  Well, personally I think strong coffee works best for me."
"I tried a bottle today and it was a waste of money. I drank the whole bottle and it tasted very gross, I almost gagged on the aftertase even though I chased it with water. Felt a tiny energy boost but less than normal from coffee. There was a ""crash."" Slight but still, they advertise that there isn't one."
"This product does work. I have taken it multiple times. Every time I do take this 5 hour energy, I am more alive and aware.<br />It helps, but it makes me crash real bad at the end. It says no crash, but just last night when I took this, I couldn't keep my eyes open after taking it, I kept trying to stay awake, soon as I laid on my bed, at 9 pm. I woke up at 1 pm the next day. I missed the entire morning because I had crashed so unbelievably hard.<br /><br />I do not recommend this to everyone, everyone has a different reaction to it, but mine wasn't so good.<br />I suggest if you take these when ""Not Tired"" to avoid heavy crashes like mine. I took mine after being up for around 18 hours. So take them when you are only feeling a little worn out, not exhausted or restless."
"Had a couple bottles while driving around on vacation this summer.  No buzz, no energy, nothing."
"Gave me such a caffeine overdose I had the shakes, a racing heart and an anxiety attack. Plus it tastes unbelievably bad. I'll stick with coffee, tea and soda, thanks."
"It is hard to review products like these because results are very dependant on each person's physiology and are also subjective.  I don't think anyone who has said they've had great success with this product is lying, nor do I think those that have said they've had little success are lying.  As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br /><br />I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br /><br />I first tried 1/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br /><br />I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the ""extra strength"" version of this product to see if that yields a better result.  For now though, while I cannot personally recommend this product based on my own results, I think each person will have to try and see for themselves.<br /><br />Update: I tried the ""extra strength"" version of this product.  I took the entire bottle and found little to no difference between this and the ""regular"" version.  Since the regular version, as mentioned above, had pretty much no effect on me, I don't plan to buy anymore of this product."
I loved the stuff! I would still use it but I found I was allergic to something in there that caused a facial rash that took the top layer of my skin off after 6 days with only one bottle! .. it was a terrible rash but great energy drink! The facial flushing they say may occur did for me in a HUGE way.. UGH!
I am pretty sensitive to caffeine so I was a bit nervous about taking this stuff. If I drink coffee or tea on an empty stomach I tend to get the heebie-jeebies. I drank a full bottle and didn't really feel anything. Nothing good and nothing bad. I took the berry flavor and it wasn't that bad at all. I think I'll stick to some strong Irish tea.
Very expensive and didn't work any better than popping an over the counter caffeine pill. And you don't have that horrible taste!
"This stuff is really gross - I tried the lemon-lime and the berry. Neither were good, but the berry was a little better. I have also tried chilling them and transfering to a glass. Nothing seems to help. Add that to the fact, that I got nothing from these. Nothing at all. Not worth the money to me. By reading the label, I can see why - they contain vitamins, enzymes, and a little caffeine - products I ingest daily anyway....maybe if you don't take vitamins or drink caffeine, these can help you."
This product is a waste of money.I noticed no effects at all.You would be better off drinking a cup of coffee and taking a vitamin.
"I decided to try this, and bought a bottle since I was up from 8:30am on a Sunday, and had to work a double (4am -Midnight and Midnight - 8am), and wouldn't be home till around 9am.<br /><br />It has a horrible taste.  I gagged and chugged down some water hoping to get rid of the taste.<br /><br />I chugged it around 5am, hoping the ""5 hour"" energy drink would last till I get home.<br /><br />Felt absolutely zero pick up, zero energy.  Didn't work for me."
"I bought a 2-pack of the orange flavor 5 hour energy drink at Wal-Mart.  I tried one bottle in the afternoon, the other 2 days later in the morning.  I drank the whole bottle, but saw no real change.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't imagine I have made myself insensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />The orange flavor tasted fine though.  Kind of like orange drink in elementary school.  It sounds like other reviewers don't like the berry or lemon-lime."
I tried this product twice and both times it gave me a headache without any added energy. My advice save your money don't even try this product unless you like headaches .
work with kids use to keep up plus I train to fight so they told me i need more words
"I FELT NO REAL EFFECT FROM THIS PRODUCT.  IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, YOU COULD TAKE THE VITAMINS, AMINO ACIDS AND CAFFEINE IN TABLES FOR A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PRICE.  OF COURSE, ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN COFFEE. I NEVER DRINK COFFEE."
"This seems to work for so many people. It didn't do a thing for me. People talk of their heart racing... I even had soda an hour or so within taking this so-called energy shot, I felt no different. It tasted nasty too. I just took this about an hour ago, I feel like I could just go to sleep. I have 0 energy. Of course I've taken ephedra and it did nothing for me... man I'm just unlucky. I wonder what it's like to feel rested and energetic! I wouldn't know and I guess I never will."
"I got the energy boost of drinking a cup of coffee, however had to hold my nose while drinking it it was so bad. Sticking to coffee which isn't great but is much cheaper and doesn't have all these chemical additives."
"Shipment was amazing. I got the item 5 days before it said it was supposed to come in. And for a product like this, you can't review the quality of the product. So, I definitely recommend this company."
"Of all the energy solutions out there, this is easily the best one.  However, it still has its drawbacks.<br /><br />First, the PROs -<br /><br />Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me)<br /><br />Not a lot of ""jitter"" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling.  This one does not<br /><br />No Crash - Its true, there is no crash.  Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash.<br /><br />A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy.  It can almost be described as a very focused high.  A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once<br /><br />Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water.  So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two<br /><br />Now, for the CONS<br /><br />Taste - See above<br /><br />Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff.  I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around<br /><br />Its addictive - The ""mental"" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again.  Probably not for people with addictive personalities<br /><br />Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much.  I seem to want to do everything all at once.  After that, i calm down a bit and become intensely focused.  But, those first 10 minutes are usually spent just trying not to knock anything over in my office"
"Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body."
"My wife and I recently took a trip from San Diego to Great Basin National Park in east-central Nevada. It's about a 750-mile drive and we attempted to do it in a day. On the way there, I was getting real drowsy by the time we got to Las Vegas and we still had another 5 hours of driving. We'd stopped at a truck stop for gas and I noticed the little bottles of ""5-hour Energy"" drink. I'd seen them advertised on TV but had never tried any kind of energy drinks. Being somewhat cautious, I sipped about half or the small bottle, saving the rest for later. Well, it seemed to work fine.<br /><br />On the way back to San Diego, I was tired and drowsy right from the beginning. I was fighting sleep all the way from the park to Las Vegas, where we gassed up. Remembering the ""5-hour energy"" drink, I bought another little bottle for the seven-hour drive to San Diego. After driving for about an hour, I consumed the whole bottle. I was wide awake almost immediately. It was amazing! I still felt very tired, but I was awake and alert and remained  that way for all the remaining drive to San Diego.<br /><br />Other than the awakeness and alertness, I experienced no side effects at all. My wife hated the taste and said she would not drink it again, but then she wasn't the one who was driving. The taste seemed fine for me. Somewhat medicinal, perhaps, but no problem.<br /><br />This stuff is effective! I'll now always have a couple bottles in my car for any long drive. It's expensive, but well worth it. The cost by the case, by the way, is substantially less than the cost of single bottles in the truck stops.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"My husband loves this stuff. We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied."
"As a person who has never consumed a cup of coffee or other energy drink before in his life, I can't say for certain just how effective 5-hour energy is in comparison.<br /><br />I can say that it worked, though -- my God, did it work. Having drunk merely half the bottle, I felt energized and ready to roll in three or four minutes. The product was true to its label in that I was able to study with concentration from 12 o'clock to 5 with no ""afternoon slump"" or ""jitters""(though for a time I did experience a subtle tingling in my fingers). When my five hours were up, I came back to normal and didn't feel any side effects or ""caffeine crash"". The product is not addictive: I bought a pack of twelve bottles a month ago and still haven't used them all.<br /><br />5-hour energy should be used with wisdom, however -- the manufacturers say that it contains ""no more caffeine than a cup of coffee"" but doesn't specify the size of the cup. It took me an hour longer than normal to get to sleep when I drank a whole bottle.<br /><br />That said, I have no other complaints to offer of this excellent energy drink. I suggest taking half of a bottle whenever you need a boost of concentration or motivation, as that is usually sufficient. Also, drink these only when you need to -- it's potent stuff, and I wager those little bottles can disappear quickly.<br /><br />5-hour energy is a great resource for workouts, daily business, and the hurly-burly of modern life. I give it 4 stars."
"I picked this up at Costco at a pretty good deal after seeing this here. Best next thing to my old Vivarin fix but better as it is in somewhat of a food form without the crash.  Do NOT take this more than the recommended 5 Hour intervals!  First you'll be wired and more on the EDGE than anything.  Taking two of these in less than 9 or 10 hours was a shock to my system and it actually knocked me out for a minute, but after that I was wired more than anything, almost ready to fly!!  Again great booster, maybe too great sometimes. You gotta remember this is basically a double shot of the regular.  You could probably just drink 1/2 of these and get the same effect of the original obviously."
"TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from ""tired"" to ""not tired"" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body."
"Makes you feel alert without making your heart pound out of your chest.  Doesn't make you feel hyper-alert, it just makes you feel normally awake.  I've taken this on the brink of exhaustion late at night it definitely makes me feel 10 AM awake, without feeling obnoxious.  I'm a regular coffee drinker but this stuff is alot more effective with no jitters.  Works for about 3 hours for me but the 'no crash' thing is a bunch of hooey.  It just means no sugar crash.  If you were tired when you took it, you obviously better be near a couch when it wears off.  Once your body remembers how tired you really are you'll pass right out when it wears off.  Definitely the best out of all the energy drinks out there when used sparingly.  Tastes horrible but it does what it claims to do.  I only use this stuff sparingly, as-needed but has yet to let me down."
"I consider myself a connoisseur of the energy drink world, and by far the 5-Hour products have been the best of the best.  For various medical reasons, I can't drink coffee or tea because of irritants/acids that naturally occur in them.  However, thanks to many years of moderate insomnia (I wake up a lot, no problems falling asleep, just can't STAY asleep), and not having good reactions to prescription sleep medications, I often still need some caffeine and/or extra b-vitamins to help get me through the day.  I've tried living without it, but sadly all it takes is one bad night without enough sleep (which is at least once a week) and I'm nodding off at my desk at work.<br /><br />I used to drink Sugar Free Red Bull, sometimes as many as 3 in a day to help me stay alert.  However, Red Bull makes me CRASH!!! I loved the taste (even though many people think it's gross), and I liked Red Bull a lot more than the other can drinks (ie. Monster, etc). However, it was almost as bad as drinking nothing at all!<br /><br />Then one day, I tried a 5 Hour Energy drink.  Back then, there was only lemon-lime and maybe berry flavors.  I preferred the Lemon Lime, and I was shocked to find that this product didn't make me jittery, and definitely didn't make me crash!<br /><br />I've been using them ever since!  Amazon.com has a great price for 12 bottles (these can be as much as 3 or 4 dollars each in NYC, if purchased at a small grocer or deli), and they offer all the varieties.  I used to use the extra strength ones, but I am downgrading myself back to the regular ones to try and limit my dependency on them (I only use them now when I absolutely need them, usually around 1 or 2pm).  I drink the whole bottle, and rarely have I ever felt the need for a second bottle during the afternoon if I had my first in the AM.<br /><br />I just tried this new-er flavor, Pomegranate, and I must say, it ACTUALLY TASTES GREAT!!  I will be buying a few boxes of these for sure!!<br /><br />As a side note, I noticed my hair and nails have been growing a lot faster since I started drinking these daily.  I can't say for sure it's a related effect, but it's an interesting coincidence!"
"I usually take one of these before lifting weights or going out to the club. I'm often tired from work so this gives me a good amount of energy to push through an activity. The best part is, I never crash from it. I would take one of these over a traditional energy drink any day."
"i bought one of these bottles because i wanted to try it out first before i got alot of them. i tryed half a bottle since i didnt want to be all hiped up. the taste was horrible..it was like drinking gross medicine. i didnt feel it right away, but i did notice after my walk to my daughters doctor (about 30mins) when i was in the waiting room and i sat down i was pretty tired and could of fell asleep. it was no more than 2 hours of me takingit. im sure if i took the whole bottle i would of gotten more energy. i may buy a few more of these bottles in different flavors. it did help me with early morning appointments that i know i wouldnt of wanted to do( no one likes sitting in  and running back in forth to 3 different offices all day)<br />besides the taste i think its alright"
"Excellent...works like any other in the category. No crash or jitters. Just a consistent non-overpowering boost of energy.<br />In the future, I will not purchase from Amazon. There's significant markup on the item. To compare, I recently bought 24pk sugarfree Monster at what turned out to be 100% markup from the pricing at a local big box store. Unit price of $1.45 apposed to amazon's $1.96/unit"
"My three teens (110lb - 125lb) loved the effect of this the first time they tried it (at about 5pm in prep. for an evening swim meet).  Swam fast for whatever reason, too.  Second time around, same circumstances, one still loved it but the others felt tired / shaky / nauseous and frankly looked quite pasty-faced.  Tried a half bottle for those two, for the third time around, and they felt no effect at all (good or bad).  All three times, they had orange flavor and they did not down it on empty stomachs.  So now two don't want to use it any more and one is still interested.  Results definitely vary, therefore, but I'd recommend newbies to try it several times in non-critical situations before you decide to down it to prep for that truly vital meeting."
"After 6 or 7PM, I tend to be pretty worn out. I saw one of these in my brother's car, and he didn't want it, so I decided to go for it. I drank the whole bottle, and I felt the effects after about 30 min. I didn't have any weird side effects, but I noticed myself twitching a lot. It does some things correctly, as physically I feel decent, but mentally I feel awful. It's the kind of feeling you get when you want to go to sleep, but you can't. The best word to describe it is restless. It also tastes awful, but you can't really mark it down based on taste, as it's not obviously supposed to be something that tastes good.<br /><br />I'll give it a couple of stars for making me feel a little better physically, but that's still questionable, as it also made me very twitchy. Definitely not a product I'd recommend to anyone, unless they felt physically fatigued. A lot of people here seem satisfied with it, so maybe it's just me."
Sorry but u can get rip it at the $.99 store that does just as good if not better. I think for what it does nothing spectacular way over priced!
"I drive a lot and frequently suffer drowsiness on the road. I was hoping this product would be the answer. Unfortunately, it  was not. The effect I feel after downing a bottle is marginal. Maybe a boost in alertness for a few minutes but quickly back to the same level of drowsiness I was at. Two bottles does not help much either.<br /><br />I'm not sure how it seems to work so well with others but I wish I had the same effects. I am 6 foot 2 inches and around 250 lbs. Not sure if it works well only with smaller individuals.<br /><br />Despite not working so well for me, I still take it occasionally on the road for the small effect it does offer - though I do wonder if it's more placebo effect than anything."
"Exactly what the title says- better price than the gas stations for sure, it just took a while to get to me."
This is a good product but beware; the cost plus s/h is no bargain.  It is probably cheaper to buy it in a store.  The only advantage here is convenience.
I rec'd different flavor of item ordered 5-Hour Energy Berry 12 bttls; but my email was answered immediately & an equitable solution was reached quickly.  Would definitely use this vendor again.
"My girlfriend and I decided to try 5-hour energy because we both like Red Bull but didn't like the ""crashing"" effect it can have after a little while. First off, Amazon's price is absolutely ridiculous. You should be able to get a 24 pack of this stuff for around $33 (at Sam's, etc.). Secondly, this stuff tastes gross (we had the berry flavored...more like vomit berry favor). Thirdly and MOST importantly: it didn't do anything except make us actually more tired. We couldn't stop yawning about 20 minutes after shooting our drinks down. I've read the negative reviews that other people have written...believe them and save your money! The positive reviews I am convinced are by people who are affected by the placebo effect. They think they should be more awake, so they ""feel"" more energized..."
"I don't usually drink energy drinks and I stopped drinking caffeine a little over a year ago, but had a long drive and I was exhausted so decided to give this a try. It worked great for the first 2-3 hours. I had a boost in energy, was more alert and felt fine, but into the 3rd or 4th hour my heart started racing, broke out into a cold sweat and was horribly jittery. When I got home my head started spinning and I couldn't sit down for hours. It was the worst feeling ever. I seriously felt like I was overdosing on a drug. Finally after 7 hours I felt a little better and was finally able to fall asleep, but all into the next day I felt horrible, entire body ached, felt unrested and still jittery. I know not everyone will react the same way, but be careful with this stuff. I did a little research afterwards and found information that suggest it is possible to OD on caffeine and Vitamin B. Maybe the percentages in this drink were just too much for me."
"While this product works with many others I know, it doesn't work for me at all. The only reason I cite that stands out for me is I eat healthy, I maintain an active lifestyle and I get enough of rest, so in the mid afternoon when I have the 5 Hour energy drink, I still feel sleepy and I can sleep through it without feeling energetic (I work out in the morning). I'd love to hear comments from others who do have a healthy, active (vagan) lifestyle and still find this energy drink valuable."
"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned."
"I drank some to try and keep me awake for an essay, I fell asleep about 15 minutes after drinking it. I don't feel it did anything for me."
The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.  Back when the natural supplement/remedies law changed allowing manufacturers to sell so call natural products it created a problem and this type of product is one of the symptoms of that problem.  They can claim it's herbal and natural etc.  and put out stuff that is not good for you.  I curse the day I signed that partition in a Whole Food type of store.  A already sick pharmaceutical industry is now even sicker.  I want a do over on that damn change.<br />If you don't like my comment good for you.  If you leave a comment I will not be reading it.  So swear away.
"It may help you in the short run but it does damage to your heart in the long run. It also taste awful this side of Cherry 7Up. By the way,Yes I did drank this stuff so you can't say I never had this before. I give this 1 out of 10."
"Lemme tell you, before this miracle drink; I couldn't please my wife for more that 50 sec's without me tiring out. I mean after seeing her fat tail everyday. I started to get limp(in the spirit that is). And then my friend Bill(you know Bill from those commercials) showed me this... and let me tell you, never has my wife been so happy, not only can I please her for a whole 50 second's but now I can please her for FIVE HOURS! At first she was just a fat repulsive whale who lost her charms, and pizazz! Now after taking 5 hour energy I can take on any challenge including my wife, and my next door's neighbors wife.<br /><br />Not only has if kept me great with my wife, I also can now power my car off on the sheer energy that radiates from my body, for 5 hours I was on a town rampage, robbing banks, hitting the gentlemen's clubs, spray painting my obscene terms on corporate buildings, you know the usual teenager stuff. Yeah my life has been great since I started taking this miracle drink. The ladies love me, the me envy me... yeah I'm the talk of the town now. I even grew extra hair on my chest, and my 2 cabbages are too huge for my size 38 pants now, I have to move up to 44's.<br /><br />Pros:<br />.Keeps you up and going<br />.Makes you the talk of the town<br />.Makes you feel like you mean something again<br />.Fends off Mid Life crisis for 5 more hours<br /><br />Cons:<br />.You may wake up with bullet wounds<br />.You black out, and wake back up to your face on the news for some reason<br />.Your wife won't be able to walk for a month"
"i drank one of these extra strengh before a math test. right after i drank it my whole body started shaking and i cudnt breathe, it also gave me diarhia.  i had to RUN outo f the class holding my ass buecause i was shaking and cudnt control my bowels. i wound up finding a girls bathroom running in and wet diarhia cameo ut and went on my boxers which i had to throw out.  everyone was looking at me and i just got home and i still feel the effects.  this embarassed me infront of my classmates and i cudnt breathe and my body was shaking and my eyes wre dilated. dont drink this plz"
"The product I received was fine, but the Supplier(Eray) was impossible to deal with.  I saw that shipping on $50.00 was to be free, only to be charged almost one-third again for shipping cost.  I feel that these people robbed me and no-one cared.  I will not do business with Amazon again do to this."
"Wow, the one star isn't based on the product itself, but the condition that my package came in... As soon as I opened it I know it was bad news. The container of the bottles was so gross and soggy from the drink leaking out of the bottles. I'm pretty disappointed since I've never  had a negative experience purchasing items on Amazon. Below are photos of what my package came looking like.<br /><br />[...]"
"I really love this product, so I thought I'd buy it online in a pack of 12... and I ended up only getting 11 in the box!!! I'm very upset over this. I expected 12, it advertises that there's 12, that I'm buying 12!! and only got 11!"
This product is a complete waste of money. I am a long distance motorcycle rider (1500 plus miles in 24 hours)and bought this product for a quick and lasting energy boost. I read the good reviews and bought a case. Form the first bottle to the last I couldn't tell any difference after taking it.It was as effective as drinking a glass of water. If you still want to try it only buy one to try and don/t waste your money on a case.
"My husband was driving 17 hours from Arkansas to SW Florida and decided this stuff would give him the boost needed to drive the distance. He took naps and ate food along the way. When he started to get tired he drank one 5 hour energy drink and arrived shortly after irritable and OUT OF CONTROL. He through a metal bar stool at my glass sliding doors of our new home. I thought he had calmed down so we went for a drive, he had a mood swing because I disagreed with him about something, he called himself stupid and started literally PUNCHING his own face while driving!!! He broke his glasses and started crying and gasping for air saying his heart was beating out of his chest. He then proceeded to do 108 MPH with our two young children in the back weaving on and off the road. He made an abrubt stop and got out. At that point I was scared to death and praying he would walk in front of a car. I started to dial 911 on my phone. He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance as police feared he was having a stroke. They said drinking the 5 hour energy on a half empty stomach triggered a response when his saritonin levels started to fluctuate drastically causing possible suicidal/homicidal thoughts and frequent mood swings~ I was 25 years old at the time, my two children were 1 and 4 years old. We ALMOST died to a chemical imbalance that was caused by 5 HOUR ENERGY! Its IMPOSSIBLE to tell how a chemical will effect you, but with possible side effects as these, they are not worth the risk! I have currently filed a lawsuit against the company!"
"Bear in mind, different people have different metabolisms and different tastes.  From past experience, I avoid anything lemon-lime flavored.  I went with orange, which tastes like watered down OJ.  Just two ounces, small bottle fits in a knapsack or desk drawer.  When I'm crashing, caffeine just gives me the jitters and I still feel tired, no matter how much coffee or tea I drink.  I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.  Also, if you have a high metabolism, take a small sip and wait 5 minutes.  Drink only what you need."
"REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT CLAIMS. I USE IT IN THE MORNING TO GET GOING AND THERE ARE NO SIDE EFFECT. LOVE THAT THERE IS NO SUGAR! ALWAYS GET THE BERRY, IT TASTES GREAT!<br /><br />JACQUIE WOODS<br />MAUI"
"I love this product. I suffer with sinus problems, which depletes my energy level and this really helps to boost me up."
"Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"
"I usually drink about twelve 12 oz Coke Zeros a day, however the aspartame is bad for your diet.  Diet colas are worse for you than regular colas.  So I switched to 5 Hour Energy to replace the caffeine.  I also have Crohn's Disease.  This disease causes me to have a Vitamin B12 deficiency, which I normally have to buy and give myself an injection for.  Not anymore.  5 Hour Energy gives me 8333% (not a typo) of my daily allowance for B12, and also provides another crucial element that my body has a difficult time getting - Folic Acid.  Both of these are essential to the human body.  So, not only do I get jacked up from the 5 Hour Energy, it counters some of the effects of my Crohn's Disease by providing me with crucial elements and energy that otherwise are drained by this disease.  I am not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, and drank 5 Hour Energy while I was there."
"First, let me say that I until trying 5 Hour Energy, I'd never tried any of the energy drinks on the market.  My main reason for not trying any of them was simple - most provide their ""energy"" boost from high levels of sugar or high-frutose corn syrup and caffeine.  Not trying to make a sweeping generalization here, and like I said, I haven't tried them - but I am an avid label-reader.<br /><br />I was in a convenience store one day and happened to pick up a bottle of 5 Hour Energy and read the label.  I was surprised that the ingredients were high in vitamins and amino acids.  But, I'm not one to try every ""miracle in a bottle"" product on the market and tend to be rather cynical when it comes to most of them, so I didn't buy any, but I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />But here's the other thing.  I have MS and Fibromyalgia.  So as a result I deal with extreme levels of fatigue every day, and I'm talking about mind-numbing, like you can't even lift your head off the pillow, debilitating fatigue.  So quite honestly, I seriously doubted that ANY energy drink was going to have much of an affect on me.<br /><br />But one day, at another convenience store, I thought what the heck I'll give it a try, and bought 2 bottles.  When I got home, I drank half a bottle.  Within minutes, I felt better, like the 5 hour had taken the edge off my typical ""my batteries are completely drained"" feeling.  My initial reaction was that the sensation was purely a psychological placebo-effect sort of thing.  A little while later, I drank the rest of the bottle.  I still wasn't exactly convinced, but at the same time was thinking ""wow, what if this stuff really works!"".<br /><br />That evening I could feel myself starting to fade again. Not at all unusual for me after about 6 or 7, and when it happens, I'm usually worthless for the rest of the night.  Then I remembered that I had another bottle.  I know that they recommend no more than 2 bottles a day, but I had to know if what I had experienced earlier was the real deal or not.  So, I drank the second bottle.  Again, within a couple minutes I could feel my energy level rebound.<br /><br />Have to admit, that while this stuff isn't a magic potion, for me at least, it does what it claims."
"This stuff really works.  I don't sleep well at night and most times have to nap during the day.  When I can't nap because of committments, and know I will get very sleepy - this energy drink keeps me awake without the jitters from coffee.  The price at Amazon is great and it's handy to have available."
"Great product , I've been an avid fun of hydroxycut hardcore from muscle tech for many years now. I have been also exposed to ephedrine for quite some time. I have a pretty high tolerance for most of energy drinks and being a 290 pounds athlete I require larger amounts of energy to get me going. I found 5H energy to actually work quite well. Make SURE to have 2H window between ur last meal and the time u drink ur energy shootl . Empty stomach is the most desireable environment for ur 5H energy shoot to kick in and in my case it does; within 5 min I already feel the surge of energy that continues for hours to come. Awake , alert , NO shivering heart palpitation trembling or similar effects."
"5 hour energy drink definitely works I have not experienced any side effects. Also it doesn't taste that bad for anyone to gag on it. That's definitely exaggerating. Within minutes of taking 5 hr energy drink my thinking is increased, I'm totally awake and I just feel so aware.  It's definitely great when you have to get up for work everyday at 5am and get home about 7pm.  I'm definitely not a morning person, but this helps me.  It's great for working out because it gives you that increased energy to actually get up off the couch and workout.  But there are some things you should remember. Try not to take on an empty stomach, because this drink increases your energy and your body needs something to burn to fuel that energy.  Another thing is only drink half of the bottle.  Why? because a whole bottle will have your hands shaking and your heart beating really fast.  I learned this the hard way. Maybe it's just my body that couldn't take the whole bottle, but to be on the safe side drink only half and see how you feel and if it's not enough then drink the other half.  I find that a half a bottle gets me through the whole day until I get ready to go to sleep that night."
I like 5 hr. Energy drink.  I have been drinking it for a couple mo.  I was doubtful at first but what the heck.I bought a couple bottles and put them in my fridge.  Couple days later I am busy in the kitchen and feeling run down.  I drank a bottle of 5 hr. Energy and layed down for a few minutes thinking of catching a small nap.  To my surprise I lie there about 15 min. and felt pretty good so I got up and went back to the kitchen and finished what I was doing and cooked something else also. Feels good to know I'm not the only one to run out of gas occasionally.flutterby2554
"I play football competitively and during our training camps, we, of course, had three-a-days (three practices per day). I would take one (or even half) before each practice and I was much more energized even with less sleep. I would recommend this to anyone who plays any sport."
"I had to drive 500 miles and the drive began late in the day when I was already tired and on a full stomach from lunch.  Needless to say I was feeling a bit drowsy.  A friend of mine suggested I try the 5 Hour Energy, and incredibly, I was wide eyed and alert for the entire drive.  The next day, I had to drive another 500 miles, and while it began earlier, I had a hard time sleeping.  Maybe it was the effects of the 5 Hour Energy still affecting me, or maybe it was because of the loud noises at my hotel.  Either way, I only had about 5 hours of rest, and I needed to cover 500 miles.  So I drank a bottle at the beginning of my drive and sure enough, I made it the entire way.  This is incredible for me as I have sleep apnea and although being treated with a CPAP machine, I still suffer from loss of energy throughout the day.  This has been the ONLY product that keeps me alert.  I do wonder what the health risks if any are though."
Great product.  I mix it with some green tea extract.  It's a great alternative to downing 3 cups of java.
"Not a big fan of energy drinks per say, a little nervous about what they might do, so I tried this stuff. This stuff seems OK, no funny reactions, no side effects. I try to only take 1/2 bottle, but sometimes need the whole thing! Graduate school is not forgiving of fatigue!"
"I've tried almost every energy drink out there and some work and some don't, but for the most part they all crash an hour or so later and leave you scrambling for some food or more energy drinks.  A never ending, ugly cycle.  I tried 5 Hour Energy and have been using it ever since.  It is truly a fantastic product.  If you need long lasting energy that wont make you feel hyped up or bring you crashing down an hour or two later, this is the product for you."
"definitely provides more energy.  I usually have a sip or two<br />if I'm feelling a little sluggish.  I agree with some of the other reviews with regards to feeling jittery.  my solution to that is,<br />don't down the whole bottle in one sitting.  I'll usually take half<br />the bottle, or less, then a little more when I need it.  after opening the bottle, it should be discarded within 72 hrs.  :-)"
"My son just returned from Iraq and they said they use 5 hour energy all the time. I decided I would try it and I was very satisfied. I was concerned about the crash but there is none. It provides a smooth long lasting boost.<br /><br />There are no jitters but I wouldn't recommend it if you are going to be sitting at a desk all day because it makes you want to get going.<br /><br />It is great for a day of yard work, hiking, cycling etc."
"I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU"">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE"">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO"">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK"">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC"">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK"">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68"">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0"">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price."
"This products seems to work well as long as you do not use it all the time.  I felt that if I used the drink a few days in a row my body just got use to it, and it didn't do anything."
"I am very leery of ""energy drinks."" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--""Does that stuff really work?"" Me--""Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!"" Them (two weeks later)--""Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!""<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)"
"I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!"
"Dear Five-Hour-Energy (Berry Flavored),<br /><br />You came into my life when I was not ready for you.  I was still in a love-hate relationship with another woman, Coffee.  I loved Coffee's black taste, her bitter aroma, and her warm awakening after missing her for so long.  But she was not the one for me, my nights with her left me shaking, heart furious.  I felt manic and trapped.  My body would crash after tasting Coffee and my mind would race, too busy spinning to do anything useful.<br /><br />Then you came into my life, my sweet 5-Hour-Energy.  Coffee had stormed out, made a big scene at the cafe.  I met you at a gas station, looking alone and forlorn.  I asked you out to a club, and we danced all night long.  Later, I took you to rock climbing, swimming, kayaking.  My heart swelled with joy but you never made it hurt.  As our relationship prolonged, we sat with each other, working, sometimes writing tender missives.  My mind was alert, never spun thoughtlessly.<br /><br />Oh my love, I'd love to love you 5 hours more, my 5-Hour-Energy.<br /><br />Love,<br />Charlie<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- works!  you do get energy!<br />- minimal crashes (only occurs when i partake TOO excessively)<br />- berry flavor is tasty<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- there's a lot of vitamin B in this.  don't know if that is good or bad.<br />- can develop an immunity if you drink two or more every day, so don't do that<br /><br />As always, don't overdo any caffeine product.  If your body does not respond well to this product, cease immediately and maybe ask your doctor.  And then tell me if there are health risks.  Because I am not a doctor.  I am a warrior poet.  If by warrior, one thinks of programmers."
"I am a serious runner and a cyclist. I am very skeptical most of too good to be true stuff but I do believe we landed on the moon and 9/11 caused by terrorists not by government. So I sacrificed  my body to test this product in the name of humanity. I run without 5 hour energy and then  I run with 5 hour energy. Difference is so obvious I really did get extra energy and power to shave off 2-3 minutes of my 5 mile morning run before annoying work day, as a matter of fact I still had gas in the tank to go another 4-5 miles if I had time. Same thing when I do road cycling specially 30-40milers, after 20 mile ride I take a shot of 5 hour energy and  double my distance. Having only 4 calories but giving you so much energy is a good thing. I recommended this for my fellow earthlings"
"This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake. Personally I have had great experience with it; though I have heard from people that they end up having to visit the bathroom due to some digestive issues."
"First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />For this reason, I would encourage people try try a bottle at a local store (sold just about everywhere) before buying 12-pack's from amazon.<br /><br />Experiences with other products -<br />I drink coffee out of habit, but it doesn't help me to stay awake.<br />Instead, it makes me jittery and occasionally sick in the stomach.<br />Soda makes me bloated and deathly sleepy within minutes.<br />Energy drinks (monster, amp) makes me alert, but not at all focused.  The effect doesn't last more than a hour and the drink makes my stomach bloated and my body tense.<br /><br />5-hour energy -<br />The first thing that will hit you is the sourness, as if you're sucking on a lemon or warhead(though not as strong).  The sourness jolts me right up and then immediately after, it turns sweet and leaves no aftertaste.<br />It gets rid of the sleepy (the in-your-head, eyelids closing, can't stay awake kind of sleepy).. but doesn't really fix tiredness or exhaustion.<br />The thing I like best about this product is the -lack of- side effects.  Doesn't make my body tense or jittery, doesn't make me bloated or sick, doesn't make me more sleepy or crash.<br /><br />Does it really last 5 hours?  I've never tried chugging the whole thing.<br />I keep one in my bag and take a sip when needed.  It usually keeps me happy and productive for a day or two.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all imo.. call me crazy but i actually really like it.  Lemon-lime being my favorite, followed by pomegranate and berry.<br /><br />Price - yes, the drink isn't cheap.<br />BUT, the price is similar for any energy drink and i think that the price of this product is way overstated because you're getting a 2oz bottle instead of a 16oz can.<br /><br />However, for it's intended purpose (keeping you awake, not hydrated), (and if it works for you)i see it as a better deal for lasting longer, also I like the small pocket-able size."
"5-Hour Energy gives us the boost without the drop. Pomegranate is our favorite flavor, but we usually buy whatever has the best deal at the time. Orange is a close second. They're all fine. After all, it doesn't take much more than a shot or less to do the trick, so the taste isn't that big of a deal. What's important is the ""clean energy"" without the plunge, addiction, stains or breath of coffee."
"Literally all of the other flavors taste like a rotten four loko, but orange tastes decent. It also doesn't give awful tasting burps like the berry or any other flavor. People who don't take these with some sort of food are misguided. These things go down much better if you have just had a small meal at the least.<br /><br />5 Stars all around"
I have tried other energy drinks and 5-hour is the only drink that does not give me headaches the next day.  Taste is just okay but bearable.  Price is expensive if you buy at convenient stores but cheaper via amazon.
"I'll be honest, I was a total skeptic of 5-hour energy for a LONG time. The TV ads seemed like a scam, no one I knew had tried them, and I just didn't buy into their marketing. Sure enough, I was browsing Amazon late at night one evening and decided to just try a box out. Why not, right? All I can say, is that these are unreal. Straight up. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually still trying to figure out how these are legal and the boost is amazing. Everything they claim is fact. There are not jittery feelings, no crash. The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap."
"I hate coffee so I love 5 Hour Energy.  I also hate paying 3 or 4 bucks at stores here and there for it so this is very economical.  I usually put one in my TSA approved quart size bag so when I am on business trips, I can have it with me for meetings."
"Can't rate this stuff highly enough, does as advertised, no let down as with sugar/caffeinated drinks.  There doesn't seem to be any addictive tendencies with 5-H-E which is nice.  I do not use this every day, great when driving to keep you alert behind the wheel.  Definitely the shizz.  Buy it.  Try it."
"This is the 3rd time ordering 5-Hour Energy through Amazon.  I use this almost every day, probably a bit too much but is great for a boost of energy at work and doesn't give me the jitters.  Buying bulk like this makes it just under $2/bottle as long as you get free shipping which ALL STAR HEALTH offers and the order doesn't have to be $25 or more either! JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE THE DEFAULT SELLER FOR THIS ITEM.  EVERY TIME I FORGET TO ORDER THIS THROUGH ALL STAR HEALTH IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO RECEIVE.  ALL STAR HEALTH WILL PROCESS AND SHIP THE VERY NEXT DAY USING UPS AND THE DEFAULT (AMAZON) TAKES 3 DAYS TO PROCESS, THEN SHIPS VIA USPS (SNAIL MAIL).  USING ALL STAR HEALTH I HAVE ORDERED ON A SUNDAY AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED ON A TUESDAY WITH STANDARD (FREE) SHIPPING."
I've tried this product twice now and I have to concur with the other positive reviews.  It makes me more alert and has a subtle but positive effect on my mood.  It seems too good to be true.
"Wow, this product is amazing! It works really well, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fast bolt of energy!"
"I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time."
Much much better than red bull or anything like that. You are awake and *alert* versus just having your heart pumping faster (due to influx of caffeine) and still being drowsy in your mind. Nothing bad to say about it.
"Aside from all the obvious advantages (size, taste, calories, sugar, etc.), the impact on my energy levels is far superior to any other energy product I have ever used (mostly coffee, red bull and rockstar).  They truly last for a very long time and don't leave you feeling like garbage afterwards.  A+"
"5 hour energy really works. It makes you awake and aware but without feeling jittery, and there's no crash."
"I'm in my late 60's & I find it gives me a boost when I need one. There are days I wouldn't get anything done without it.  Used properly, it's great, DON'T ABUSE IT!"
"This is a good product for energy, at a great price -- available with free delivery."
"This drink delivers exactly what it promises. You get the energy boost you need without the side effects of a caffeine or sugar overload, which means you also don't get the crash when it wears off.  However, I would recommend taking it in small doses.  When I drink an entire bottle at once I get an immediate rush that eventually tapers off a bit and keeps me going for 5-6 hours.  However, it also makes me a little queasy.  I've gotten much better results by sipping on a bottle all day.  I sip about 1/4 quarter of the bottle every 2 hours.  This keeps me going all day without getting that upset stomach feeling. Highly recommended."
For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.
This stuff really works great for me! It doesn't make me shaky like some other drinks that I have tried and I don't crash after it wears off.
"I have Adult A.D.H.D. and this product works well for me. For those that do not know understand, ADD and ADHD people have an issue if various stimulants and relaxants having the opposite effect. For an example, Red-Bull will put me to sleep while a Benadryl will have me bouncing of the walls.<br /><br />5-Hour will not have me bouncing off the walls or falling asleep. It simply allows me to stay alert when I am otherwise dragging my but. In the end I don't even notice the effect until it wears off after 24+ hours of no sleep."
"I don't know about ya'll; but I work in an office and right between 2:00 -3:30, I experience an almost daily crash.  Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual ""too much caffeine"" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!"
"I purchased this product late last week for my husband.  He had been buying it at a local mom & pop store for about a week.  He had been very pleased with its results.  When I placed the order, I told him I thought it would be here on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  On Tuesday morning, the UPS truck rolled into my driveway with my order.  I could not have been more pleased.  Not only was the speed of delivery fast from CA to ME, but it was well packaged, in a properly sized box with minimal packing materials(appealing to the enviromentalist in me).  I had also looked at other products on your site and will be ordering again soon.  The prices were very good as compared to the health food store where I generally get these products.  Thank you for your great service.  It is most appreciated.  Annette from Maine"
The company was on time and as advertised. We have used the product for some time and it works without giving you the jitters or the sudden collapse you get with caffiene products.
"I just recently purchased this product, so I could get the energy to get off my butt and hit the gym. This definitely helped me do that, and since I count calories, this product also have a definite plus. 4 Calories!  :)<br /><br />  I would suggest to take this as early as you possible can, because you will be wide awake. I think this also helps with concentration, but not right after you take it. heh. If you take this for concentrating, wait a while to do work, or study. I don't experience any unpleasant wired-ness with this product, it's great!"
"I'm a medical transcriptionist (typing all day).  Taking the berry 5 hour mid morning I don't get the early afternoon sleepiness, don't have jitters, and just feel good."
"My brother (who's in the Air Force) loves this stuff, and eventually I got into it as well. I just sent him a 12 pack  as a gift to keep him going during his daily 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />If you have never tried regular 5 hour, I would try that first (especially half a bottle to see how it effects you). Then, if you feel like it's just so-so, try one of these extra strength ones and you might see a significant improvement. Energy products affect us all in different ways, and 5-Hour Extra is packed full with high amounts of B-complex and energy concentrated mixture (Gaurana, Taurine, Caffeine, Ginseng, etc.). I've read doctor's reviews of energy supplements like these, and as long as you aren't chugging down more than the recommended amount (2 bottles a day max), they are perfectly fine. Make sure you talk to a MD if you have high blood pressure, or have medications that might interact with a highly caffeinated shot such as these.<br /><br />I recommend putting these in the refrigerator and drinking them in the morning, or an hour before working out."
The part i really like about this product is that it does not make me jittery and i don't crash after use...great product
I drink this one third at a time. It works great for me. My only complaint is that it is so expensive (I ave 26/20 bottles).<br /><br />On the bottle it says it will keep for 3 days once opened. I usually drink one bottle over the course of a day and it makes a huge difference for me!
"First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either."
"quality control is poor.  received 12 pack, but 2 were empty.  still sealed by the manufacture. you could tell no fluid inside, just air.  i squeezed the bottle and it showed no leaks. no hole to be found. anyway by squeezing it should have showed where the hole was.  it is full and empty.  i hope the drink is under better quality control.  lee,  fort wayne"
"This product did absolutely nothing for me. I even tried taking multiple at a time and still no increased in any type of energy. I've read elsewhere the regular caffeine users do not benefit from this kind of energy drink-- I am unsure if that is accurate, but I do consume caffeine daily."
"I started using 5HrE last spring and have been using one every couple days when I feel like I am dragging and need to be on task NOW.  5HrE does it for me.  The auto buy feature is great.  It shows up at my door without me remembering to purchase it.  Plus, it is less expensive this way.  Love t!"
"This will get you through your late afternoon slump. I love the stuff. Can't stand the taste, but you shoot it and it's done. The Pomegranate is, to me, the most palatable of the flavors. I drink just 1/3 of these and have just the right energy boost for the rest of the day. And since they last, once opened, for 72 hours ... It's perfect. 1 bottle covers three days for me."
"Ok seriously, this is the best product I have found that really wakes you up, doesn't make you jittery, and doesn't make you crash.  Typically every morning I just have a pop in the morning and that's fine, but on mornings when I am dragging, this is what I drink and it wakes you up fast and makes you feel great!  I subscribe and save to this so I always have some at my desk at work."
I love this stuff the pomegranate flavor is my favorite. I drink 1 everyday just to get my morning started
"Awesome Product, Really does help with a Round of Golf or getting Home project done!<br />Works pretty quick and you can take half now and half in about an Hour or so for a quick Boost."
"I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups and I like this ""HOT"" bag version. The product is a great soup with much flavor, a very spicy hot taste (at least to me) and lots of noodles. I modify this and other Korean soups a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions and some cut-up pieces of roasted chicken breast ""after"" making the soup (do not add extras during the boiling process as that over-cooks the additions) to make it higher in protein. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great ""power lunch"". Love this soup and other Korean soups, they are fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl."
"I have 3 dogs ranging in size and age: 8 year old Husky Medium/Large, >1 year old SharLab midsize, and a Rot/Pit/Shepard/Lab 4 years old thats a beast (huge)!<br /><br />Anyway, these 3 dogs are now on the Merrick Whole Earth foods and loving it!  Prior to this food I have tried everything, including prescription food which was dog dependent so it got REALLY exspensive fast.  Merrick food is very reasonably priced and the ingridients were well chosen (designed well for overall health).<br /><br />The husky: Very VERY picky eater. She refuses almost anything you put in front of her, many times she would skip 3 or 4 meals just because it did not appeal to her.  She does not eat this food with gusto (as her favorite meal is salmon and cornbread stolen from a plate) but she does eat this food with little hesitation and she seems to be doing well (unfortunately we need to put her on senior diet as shes pudging up a bit)<br /><br />The SharLab: Shes a new adition so her dietary habbits are that of a puppy, eat everything and anything. However recent vet visits have found her in tip-top health.<br /><br />The Rot/Pit/Shepard/Lab: This poor dog... lets just say anything that could have gone wrong to him did before he was adopted. He has extreme allergic reactions (hair loss, skin rashes, skin breaks and drying), digestive issues (gas, vomits mostly), behavioral issues linked to inncident before being adopted :[ (anger management, compulsive doggy disorder, extreme doggy depression when his humans arent around) and then some... anyway from this laundry list of defects it seems that his diet controlled many of the ""flare ups"" that he had.  Lets say I've tried him on at least 10 foods, merrick has been the best so far.  Since this food his gas has reduced, he no longer is having allergic puff ups or hair loss, he is maintaining a healthy weight, he no longer vomits everywhere, urinary infections have ceased to exist, his energy level has normalized he no longer runs around like he is on caffeine nor does he mope around.  He seems to be doing really well with this food.<br /><br />Food is the owners choice, this one works for all three dogs and has helped my problem dog immensley!  If you are going to try it buy the smaller bag first and see how your pooch responds to it (remember to transition slowly to any new food!) I like this food and will stick with it!"
During the last recall (not the 1st for them) I bought this and like it better then CSFDLS. Dogs like it and I feel better with a product that has not been recalled. Quality Control and Poor Custome service during the recall lost me and this dog food fits the bill and is about same price..THANKS!
"We've been feeding this to our 2 year old Golden for about a year now and she's doing very well with it. As a puppy coming from a shelter, she was used to eating junk as in Pedigree Puppy food, and at first was not liking Merrick's main brands. We decided to try Whole Earth.... she loves it and is healthy and full of energy. On top of that, its cheaper than Merrick's other brands."
"This has to be the best grain-based dry dog food in this price range.  Chicken meal and turkey meal are the main sources of animal protein, and the only ""controversial"" ingredient is the tomato pomace (byproduct of processing tomatoes, some people believe it to be a cheap filler for dog foods).  This ingredient is so far down the list that it likely makes no difference.  This product has been rated as an ""above average dry dog food"" earning 4 stars with DogFoodAdvisor.  The great thing about this dog food is that it is in the price range of 2 and 3 star foods (foods I wouldn't recommend)<br /><br />On to the other important point, do dogs like the taste?  My dog, a lab/pit/mutt is quite a picky eater.  Many times I have purchased dog food that she hated and had to give it away.  However, she loves this food!  My brother's lab mix also loves this food. No gas, no ""smelly"" poops, no problems!<br /><br />Any more pluses? Made in the USA, natural ingredients and a  great brand of dog food (only one recall in 09/10 for their beef filet square treats)!"
"I ordered the Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food from Amazon because I live in a small rural town where there are not many healthy dog food options. I have 8 big dogs -all rescues. I had been feeding the Diamond Large Breed All Natural for quite a while. My dogs, who tend to be good, non-picky eaters, started being fussy about eating it. Since I bought 10 bags at a time and dumped them into big cans for storage, I never had numbers to check for Diamond's frequent recalls. I gave up on Diamond.<br /><br />I ordered Merrick Whole Earth Farms based on comments from other reviewers which were essentially all positive. There are no questionable ingredients according to dogfoodadvisor.com. My dogs seem to like it. They are 7 Standard Poodles and a Bluetick Hound/Dalmatian mix, age 2-14. I have 22 acres fenced and a room with a doggie door, so they play outside most of the day while I am at work. They eat about 2 cups each twice a day.<br /><br />I will buy Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food again and I highly recommend it to other dog owners."
Trouble doesn't like this dog food - will have to donate this to the humane society and go back to his salmon based food.
"My dog has had so many different skin problems throughout her life.  Since she started eating this food, I swear they disappeared! No more flaky, red, itchy skin. She loves the food and it's good for my other dog too :-)  Win Win!"
"I really wanted to love this dog food, unfortunately, it just didn't work out. I had my 1 1/2 year old Siberian Husky on it for six months, and while he didn't lose weight during that time, he would regularly skip 2-3 meals.  His bowel movements became very liquidy, and he had to go poop so many times every day. It even got to the point that his stomach would be so upset that he would just go in the house - keep in mind that this is a fully potty trained dog. He just never seemed to enjoy this food, and it never seemed to sit well with his stomach. The final straw was when the bag I received from amazon had a horrible odor to it and 1/4 of the pieces of food in the bag seemed covered in mold. It had definitely gone bad. I'm not sure if that was amazon's fault, or an issue with the manufacturer, but either way, I pulled my dog off of this food.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are quality and it is reasonably priced, but unfortunately it just didn't sit right with my pup."
I am very pleased with this dog food.  The ingredients are all whole food and things you know and understand.  I have two large dogs and they just gobble it up.  Shipping is free and suprisingly fast.  Very pleased.
"I have two indoor adult bloodhound dogs each 100 lbs..<br />They eat 4 cups of Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry<br />Dog Food per day..<br /><br />It's hard to speak for the dogs but based on the fact that<br />they eat it all at feeding time, it's probably good tasting<br />to them. I have not once had them turn their noses up.<br /><br />My observation is that the ingredients are wholesome,Its a mix<br />of some pretty delicious meats, veggies..No corn, no grain..<br /><br />The dog food is a dark brown all solid color.. consistent small bites.<br /><br />Some talk about the dog's poop being better in some way..it didn't<br />change anything about that, nor did their weight increase..but I<br />measure and feed based on how active they are on that day..<br /><br />If I could change just one thing about this food, it would be to<br />not use a tomato paste (filler in my opinion) and to make the<br />pieces bigger for my dogs chewing pleasure..<br /><br />Will buy again, quick shipment as promised, even earlier.."
"We have a 70 lbs lab mix and have been using the Merrick brand for a while. I just came across the Whole Earth Farms type and decided to try it. Our dog never had any food allergies and has never been particularly picky about what he eats and seems to like the taste of this. We tend to add a little bit of warm water to the dry food, which creates a nice mix. This seems to be good quality food at a very good price. Love the fact that I can order this via Amazon Prime and have it delivered in 2 days!"
Very pleased with this healthy and affordable dog food. My greyhound loves it and his stools are smaller and firm on this kibble. Absolutely no problems with gas or loose stools during the transition to this kibble or after.
"(Only 4 stars because it's just been a couple of weeks so far.)<br /><br />I switched my 11 month old rottie puppy over to this from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018DLUPC"">Merrick Before Grain #3 Buffalo Dry Dog Food, 25.3-Pound Bag</a> because it's cheaper and she'd shown no signs of a grain allergy overall.  She loves it, and I've seen no sign of digestive problems thus far. She's got a fairly easy stomach, so I didn't phase her over too carefully, but she had no noticeable issues with the change (probably helped by the change within the same brand, of course.) She eats a little less than when she was on the Buffalo--3-4.5 cups a day instead of 4-5 cups.  It's possible that I have a little more to clean up, you know, afterwards, but not a noticeable amount (I'm a city dweller, so this is an important factor in dog food.)<br /><br />My cat is still on the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001709GF2"">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Dry Cat Food, 11.1 Pound Bag</a>, but while cats are obligate carnivores, I have no problem with grains in a dog diet, as long as they're in moderation and the dog isn't sensitive to them.  Of course, the cat preferred the puppy's food when she was getting Buffalo, but he is willing to compromise his ideals for the occasional nibble of this stuff too."
"Switched from Canidae Pure Grain-Free Formula because it caused an allergic reaction to Merrick Whole Earth Formula because it was rated so highly and was affordable for a graduate student.  Unfortunately, while the Canidae caused my dog to shed fur everywhere and lose patches of his fur, he immediately disliked Merrick and would refuse to eat it.  This is a dog that eats everything that you hand him, so I was initially surprised.  Then, I realized after observing him attempt to eat the food for about a week that he was eating it fast and throwing it back up.  I understand that dogs that eat fast will sometimes choke but this never occurred before with Canidae.  Then, after about a week of eating, choking, throwing it back up, and eating it again (gross, I know) he began to refuse to eat it altogether - missing meal times and sullenly looking at me for half the day until he was starving enough to eat a couple of bites.  After thinking about whether it would be spoiling him if I just shucked the entire bag I'd bought and try another brand, he tore me down when I noticed that he was losing weight, after having already experienced rampant allergic weight loss on Canidae.  So, I switched to another brand today and observed: he tore into that new brand of dog food like today was his last day on earth.<br /><br />So, to conclude: Merrick Whole Earth Farms Dry Food is really affordable and offers quality ingredients - although it is not grain-free, the merits of grain-free are still being contested by dog nutritionists and its expensiveness (in my opinion) is the same expense that individuals would pay at the onset of the Atkins fad - which are being given to the consumer at a good, affordable price.  It is really unbecoming of the dog food market in general that consumers are forced to pay unholy prices to feed their dogs something that isn't made out of processed chicken by-products so Merrick gets an extra star from me just because there are so few foods out there that challenge its affordability balanced with quality. Unfortunately, no matter how good the price is, if your dog won't eat it, its a waste."
"I am so thrilled with this purchase.  I have tried to purchase it at our local markets, & not been able to.  It is the best marinade for chicken that I have ever had & its so fast."
"This is an excellent product that I was able to buy on any store shelf...until I moved. Thankfully, I was able to buy it on Amazon. It's hard to give up something my entire family loves for dinner!"
"I'm not a hard candy person, but my husband is and he loves this product. The candy is mild and sweet, and it doesn't have any artificial junk in it. He has gone through many bags of these Iced Mint Mango treats! The Amazon price for a pack of six can't be beat!<br /><br />The ingredients are not listed on this page, so here they are in case you're curious: Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Natural Mint Flavor and Natural Mango Flavor."
"The go Naturally Organic mint mango candy is delicious. My wife has a medically condition which doesn't allow her to consume artifical ingredients, this works out wonderfully. The price is at least 40 cents less than we have been able to buy in a health food store. We signed up for auto delivery. Try them you'll likem them"
"Honestly, these candies could possibly be too good. My patients seem to grab a few extra on their way out the door. And I'm guilty of have a few there and there as well. So, needless to say, my candy dish is always having to be refilled.<br /><br />These candies are very mild but very tasty. I know you'll enjoy them."
"I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me."
"I took one out and it told me to put 17.5 ounces of water into a covered dish and microwave for 9 minutes (approximately the amount of time to turn dirt into lava)... so I started out pretty darn skeptical.  Then I opened the powder package and it smelled like fish food from my acquarium, so amazingly the skepticism increased.  After considering whether to dump them or eat them I finally had a spoonfull and it was one of the best moves ive ever made. These things are friggen deliscious, I'm a fan for life and will definately be a repeat buyer."
"I am a ""spicy noodles and soup"" person.  If you're like me, you'll like this product.  I like to boil the noodles with high heat in more water than suggested for about 5 minutes, then add an egg (to poach in the soup) for another minute and a half.  The egg will continue to cook after you take it off from the heat.  Finish it off with some chopped scallions and/or cilantro, and you've got yourself a delicious meal for about a $1!  Sometimes I'll add a few shrimps right before I add the egg to make the soup more hearty.  You can make this your own by adding other ingredients to jazz it up, like tofu, veggies, etc.  Have fun with it.  Bon appetite!"
"This is one of the tastiest brands of ramen ever.  There quick and easy to make, no prep work needed, just boiling water.  The noodles are thicker then those card board cup o noodle and so much more tastier.  The sauce is spicy so it'll get you sweating on a cold night.  I recommend eating these while watching your favorite TV show or if you need a quick noodle fix."
"I ate a lot of ramen noodle soups in my college dorm days (didn't we all?) but this one is SO much better!  The noodles are the Udon style which means they are thicker and heartier than the Nissan or Maruchan.  Also, this soup contains not only a soup base packet but also a veggie packet, which the other soups don't.  Even better!<br /><br />In the veggie packet is a lot of dried seaweed, which, when added to the boiling water, rehydrates into recognizable, pleasantly chewy chunks of seaweed!  The flavor base contains mussels and cuttlefish, so, between the seaweed and those sea creatures, there is a nice seafood flavor to the broth.  And, to be honest, with Nissan and Maruchan, I really can't tell the difference between ""oriental"" ""chicken"" ""beef"" or ""pork"" flavors... they all just taste pretty much like ""broth"".  With this soup, the broth actually tastes good and the seafood flavor comes through!  And, while it is nicely spicy, in the future, I may add some Sriracha since I like it even spicier!  I might also add some dried mushrooms and a few green onions, and, once in a while, Sichuan peppercorns for some tingly, floral flavor since I love them in my Asian soups!<br /><br />Also, I have never been to any Asian countries (only Europe) but Hubby has spent a lot of time with the military in Japan and Korea, so I asked him how this packaged soup compared to noodle vendors on the streets... and he said that they usually included some sort of protein (squid, octopus, pork or beef mostly) with the soup, but the noodles and broth were VERY similar to the flavor and spiciness of this soup.  He also enjoys it!<br /><br />As some reviewers recommended, I also added an egg at the end of cooking to add to the protein.  I love to cook, but there are days when I'm just too tired and 2 packages of this soup makes a nice, filling (and quick and easy!) meal for under a dollar each for Hubby and me.  I actually purchased this soup at a HUGE Asian market about 30 miles from me... for $1.09, so amazon beats their price if you spend $25 to get free shipping... and you don't have to spend the gas!  I see they now also have a subscription service which lowers the price even further.<br /><br />Compared to Nissan and Maruchan (and especially that dreck in the ""cup o' noodles"" which has NO flavor!), this Nong Shim soup rates 5 stars from me!"
"I've been eating Nong Shim Neoguri for about 20 years... I was introduced to it in high school by a Korean student, and I've been slurping them ever since.  Back in those days, a case of 20 at the local Korean market was $7.  Now, they're $20+ on Amazon.  Still worth it though.<br /><br />There are really three things going on in the package:<br /><br />- The noodles: The heavy buckwheat Udon-style noodles have superior flavor and texture compared to ramen and other instant noodles.<br /><br />- The soup base: Very salty, very (red) peppery.  Not too complex, but tasty, and if you want complex from a bag of instant noodles, you might need to adjust your expectations.<br /><br />- The seaweed: I don't like seaweed, but I like this.  I don't know why that is.<br /><br />Because I like spicy, I typically use much less water than called for (I use about 1-2 cups depending on how brave I'm feeling) to produce almost more of a sauce that coats the noodles than a soup.  In my opinion, these noodles are at their best if you can eat them with a fork and still have minimal broth left over when you're done.  You may want to bring Tums to that party though.<br /><br />These are, in my opinion, as good as it gets in the instant noodle market.  I.e. they are five-star instant noodles, not five-star food.<br /><br />Downsides: The sodium and saturated fat are really high, if I still ate these like I did when I was 18, I'd be dead by now (37).  Also, merely reading the list of chemicals involved out loud may cause an allergic reaction in organic eaters.  I harbor a dim suspicion that ingesting enough would varnish one's insides in a way that may be of interest to anyone interested in bringing mummification back into fashion."
"I'm new to Korean food but I have an adventurous palate.  Here is my American way to ""ruin"" this dish:  Boil about double the water they recommend, then reduce to a simmer.  Add diced or sliced fresh soup vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, okra, etc) and the spice mix and the dried veggie mix.  Cook until the carrots are softened. Then toss in diced fresh tomato and the noodles (I like to pulverize the noodles in the package first so they will stay on my soup spoon; cannot master chopsticks!). Just before you take it off the heat, toss in a raw egg or two and mix rapidly.<br /><br />Then you have a big hearty pot of soup, with the salt and MSG diluted but still full of flavor, feeds 2 or 3."
"I like the Nong Shim seafood noodles better than their regular spicy noodles and a lot better than Japanese-style instant ramen.  I'll buy another box when the price gets near $10 for a box of 20 again.  I usually boil for only 3 minutes to get a more al dente taste.<br /><br />Like all instant noodles, these are kind of high in fat and calories.  The nutrition information is for less than half a package.  If you're on a diet, you should eat more veggies instead of these noodles."
"Guess I am one of the few that was not real impressed by this flavor.  I did not hate it, but found it only to taste of seaweed rather than seafood.  For some reason I don't classify seaweed as quite making the more generic seafood category.  LOL  That said I did not hate it either.  It was definitely OK for a change of pace, I was not wow'd by the seaweed flavor, and the spicyness was basically a red pepper type spicy.  I am more of a fan of the Nong Shim KimChi soup.  For some reason that one hits the spot for me, and the spicy flavor is different than the normal red pepper flavor that comes across with this soup."
"NongShim Neoguri Spicy Seafood Udon Type Noodle is my third Nongshim noodle that I've tried and love (I have tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE"">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K"">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>).<br /><br />The taste of this noodle is spicy and seafood-y, and I personally like the dried vegetables that are included with this noodle; I think there are dried seaweed and kelp, and also some chopped green onions. At first, I was a little bit disappointed due to the 'fishy' smell of the soup base (just like one of the reviewers here mentioned, the smell did remind me of fish food); however, after the noodle was done cooking, I was happy to find that the smell was significantly reduced. Also, because this is supposed to be an udon noodle, the texture, which I like, is thick and chewy.<br /><br />Although this noodle is tasty, there is a downside. I found that all the instant ramen noodles that I have eaten so far are guilty for their notoriously high sodium content, including this one. The whole package of soup base powder cost us 86% of our daily sodium intake allowance, which is worrying to me (note that on the package, it says that the sodium content is 43% of the daily allowance; but it's only for half serving).<br /><br />What I do to deal with this: I use only half of the soup base powder and use less water so that the soup won't be too bland (I can always adjust the amount of water later on). I also add a splash of sesame oil before turning off the heat, and maybe some chopped fresh green onions when I'm not too lazy to do the chopping. Sometimes I also add imitation crab meat or eggs. Doing these really make the noodles more flavorful without having to use all of the soup base powder. If you're still worried about the sodium, do what I sometimes do: eat the solids only, and maybe several sips of the soup and dump the rest of it.<br /><br />All in all, this noodle is tasty and can potentially be healthier if we avoid using all of the soup base powder. I give this product 5 out of 5 stars."
"One of the best instant noodle soups I've ever eaten.  But it is even better if you add a packet of Kikkoman's instant Wakame Soup (Amazon sells this too), and a few cloves of fresh garlic sliced about a minute before you take it off the burner.  The Kikkoman's Wakame Soup is loaded with thinly sliced very tender and savory seaweed and spices that mix perfectly with this soup. The combination is scrumptious! I will be ordering both soups again."
"This is the only instant noodle that everyone I know who tried it absolutely loves! It's spicy (to make it less spicy, put the packet in only at the end, and put in less powder.), and the noodles are nice and thick. I like to cook mine a bit longer so the noodles get thicker. Note: The closer to the expiration date, the longer you'd have to cook it to get the same texture. The noodle bag comes with 2 packets, one with veggies and seaweed and one with flavor powder.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is the exact same product as Nong Shim's ""Seafood"" noodle. It just has the non-English name, ""Neoguri""...<br /><br />The difference between this and Shin Ramyun (another one of my favorites) is it has seaweed instead of mushrooms in the veggie packet."
"Firtst above all, DO NOT EAT THIS CANCER-CAUSING NOODLE!<br />Recently Korea FDA reported and warned customers that this noodle has too much BENZOYPRENE.Benzoyprene is an organic compound with the formula C20H12. Benzopyrene is CARCINOGENIC, because it moduletes DNA, interfering with transcription. However, the company is insisting Benzoyprene is absolutely safe!! WTF!!?? Do you want cancer? Try this...<br /><br />UPDATE: Korea FDA recently announced that customers should return these products!"
"I like these, especially when I am on a budget. To make these right, you need to have two pots of boiling water. Bring both pots to a rapid boil. Add the noodles to one pan and let come back to rapid boil. Other pan, once boiling add some vegetables, I add some sliced red onion, add one or two eggs and cook only till whites are cooked but leave the yolks raw. The yoke is great dripping over the noodles. When the noodles are done, drain the water and rinse the noodles. That gets rid of the palm oil that they are deep fried in and some of the extra starch. Once the eggs are done to your liking, drain off the water until  you only have enough for the amount of broth you want. Add the packets to this pan. I only use half of the hot powder. Then place the noodles in a large bowl and poor the broth, egss and vegetables over the noodles. If you time this right, you can add some thin sliced beef or even sprinkle some grated cheese then cover and let the hot water cook the beef and melt the cheese. I use a stainless steel bowl and if it is not hot enought to melt the cheese or cook the beef to your liking you can put it on the burner for a little while. Or, you can add the beef earlier right after the egg. Slice the beef thin, I like flank steak, and it will cook quickly. I like my beef rare."
"I bought this to eat as a noodle soup for lunch.  It's pretty spicy and I'm trying to cut back on my salt intake, so I usually use just half the soup base packet, which is perfect for me.  It's great as a soup, but I've taken to adding just enough hot water to float the noodles, then microwaving for 5 minutes.  Just about all the water gets absorbed and I end up with a sort of ""yakisoba-like"" noodle dish that is pretty addictive. I agree that it can be a little seaweedy if you're not used to that sort of thing, but to me it's no stronger than the average dashi you get in Japanese restaurants.  For the price, this is a cheap, tasty, and filling noodle dish."
"This used to be my favorite noodle to eat. But now that it is made without msg, it does not taste the same and I no longer like it :("
"I am a noodle fan.  I can enjoy almost any kind of noodle.  Spaghetti, ramen, Pho, Pad thai, you name it.  But this Nongshim Neoguri reign supreme.  I will gladly eat this any day any time any occasion. This thing is that good."
This was always a favorite of mine growing up.<br /><br />Spicy with thick good noodles.<br /><br />Its not for everyone however as people can get put off by the small cuttlefish bits and seaweed chunks.<br /><br />It's a Nong Shim riff on the classic Korean Jamppong dish! (Spicy noodles in seafood broth)<br /><br />Delicious!
"These are very good noodles. They're very easy to prepare in a microwave. An excellent snack on their own, but be aware that the included spice pack is very hot (I like it like that) and you may want to experiment with how much you add. It would be a shame to waste those tasty noodles because you overdid the spice. You can always add a little more if it's not hot enough."
"Good stuff. The price is right. Even using only half of the spice pack, this soup mix will warm your mouth, bring sweat to your forehead, and make your nose run. The effects only last for a few minutes, save for a cold winter day. One package makes enough for two, add several frozen shrimp to the hot water for extra protein."
"I love this ramen. It's so cheap and easy to make. What I do is I boil about 20 oz of water (a little more than recommended since I like the broth), put the noodles in. Around 3 minutes I put in a beaten egg, then stir and chop to make the eggs into little pieces. At the 4 minute mark I put in the spice and veggie packet. Around 6 minutes I turn off the heat. Stir occasionally throughout. Comes out perfectly and much better than microwaving!"
"This is simply my favorite ramen.  I love everything about it -- the noodles, the broth, and the spices.  Everyone I know who has tried this has converted from that maruchan garbage.<br /><br />I've always made this by bowling, sometimes throwing in an egg or vegetables for some added flavor.<br /><br />I'm pretty spoiled by online shopping, China/Koreatown is a little further than I care to drive, and this price is identical to the instore price for  case (as far as I can recall), so this is a solid deal.<br /><br />ALthough I admit, I would be a little disturbed by someone who would put this on Subscribe & Save."
I got them at a very good price. The taste is bit different and takes a little time getting used to it. I have started to like the taste very much specially the seaweeds that come with it.
I bought this soup for my husband who likes things hot and I mean hot hot.....he loves this soup.  Eats it every week and when given a choice always picks this soup.....
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQLV3S"">Nong Shim Neoguri Spicy Seafood Udon Type Noodle, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>I like this spicy and mild hot flavor:-D<br />So good in cold weather....;-)"
"I had really high hopes for this soup... we love asian foods/soups, seafood, seaweed, noodles and spice.  So it sounded like a perfect combo!<br /><br />I know this review is in the minority, but please remember that it is just my own personal experience and does not reflect the rest of the world, which is why it is ""my review"".<br /><br />So, I excitedly made a bowl this morning and after the first bite had to force myself to eat half a bowl worth... in a word it was disgusting.  Maybe mine are from a defective batch, but the seaweed & very HOT pepper is all you can taste... no seaFOOD not even an undercurrent.  And now that my throat & mouth are still burning & my stomach is queasy (hours later) I am wondering why I forced myself to eat even that much.<br /><br />I did give 2 stars for the noodles since they seem like they will be good without the flavor packets."
"I LOVE these noodles! I cook them up in a pot because I feel like if I boil the noodles a bit longer than directed, the noodles are soft and chewy. I throw in some frozen shrimp and scallops too and boil it all up together and it turns out great! I don't add the veggie pack though cause I think they're too dry and they don't have any flavor either (in my opinion). This has become my absolute favorite instant noodles!"
"I have been eating this stuff for quite some time.  It never gets old.  I absolutely love the noodle quality and the dried seafood packet.  I tend to use much less water and only put in 1/2 of the hot spice packet.  I ALso love my noodles ""al dente"" so after the water boils, I only cook the noodles for 1 minute and serve it up.  Sometimes I add a few Vietnamese beef balls (with tendon), sometimes add peas.  The beauty of ramyun is that you can customize it to suite your taste."
Great price! I don't have to go to the Korean market to get it! So delicious! Shipping is free when I buy 2 cases. This is like the store sale price and I don't have to wait for it to go on sale! Added bonus...comes to my door! Can't beat that! Shipped within days! 5 stars!
i really like spicy food and that really sit for me.en~~~~~~~~~~cheap is better.I will buy this one after maybe i have eaten all my food
I've been keeping a case of these in the house for a long time now and it's a good addition when you don't want to cook a big dinner or just don't want to eat much for lunch or something. It's different than regular ramen noodles since those are extremely instant; this kind you have to let it cook for a little longer to make sure it's getting softer and wider and edible. It's not that spicy if you take it easy with the spice packets. I always receive it quite fast after I place the order so I like that too.
"I was hoping the seafood flavor on these noodles would be stronger. Still a great meal for great price, and plenty hot!"
"I'm currently deployed on a USN Destroyer. I ordered this and Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun. They both came pretty quickly considering military mail and they microwave well. I use a pyrex dish and it's perfect (I hate how plastic smells like ramen forever). It tastes good and it's freaking spicy! Awesome! Everyone is wondering what I'm eating around here. It's really not that fishy and I know another review said it smells like an aquarium... Nope. It doesn't. It's seaweed that has a smell, but it's not bad. Effing delicious and spicy. Buy NOW!<br /><br />I also strongly recommend the Shin Noodle Ramyun if you just wanna steer clear of the seafood."
"Even though its name includes a word ""Udon"", the noodle is far from actual Udon noodle. However, I love this noodle!!! It has just right amount of firmness and flavor. It is said that noodle's true goodness is brought out by soup. This seafood flavored soup is amazing!!! It is moderately spicy to stimulate your taste buds in order to enjoy thick firm noodle. Seafood based broth is thick and strong in this soup. I have been ejoying the product for years and I am still not tired of it. LOL. I highly recommend this product to any noodle lovers."
"I love these deluxe ramen noodles.  I typically add an egg and/or some fresh vegetables in addition to what's in the pack (broccoli, onion, mushroom, etc.)."
"I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups and I like this version too. The product is a great soup with much flavor, a nice spicy hot taste (at least to me), a good seafood taste (sea weed and other sea spices I think) and lots of noodles. I modify this and other Korean soups a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions ""after"" making the soup (do not add extras during the boiling process as that over-cooks the additions) to add a little taste and texture. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great ""power lunch"". Love this soup and other Korean soups, they are fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl."
"I love these noodles, especially this Udon type. Among all the instant noodles, it is one of the best. Although, it does take a long time to cook."
"I ordered this noodle from time to time. It is a really good backup in the kitchen. Once you do not want to cook, you can use it to sweep the hunger. Fast and easy."
"The taste isn't as fantastic as I thought it would be but overall it is a decent bag of noodles. I like the texture of it but the taste is just plain. The only only strong flavor is probably the spicy flavor bag. By spicy, this isn't the tasty spicy, this is plane spicy. I will save these noodles for a rainy day when I do not want to go out and get something to eat."
"Great product. Loved it! Tried it for the 1st time based on reviews. Will certainly buy more. Wonderful with egg, veggies added to broth. Makes it a complete meal. Noodles have a nice consistency."
"We have been buying this Ramen for years whenever we can find it at the local grocery. It was so great to get it in bulk from Amazon. This has thicker noodles so they have some substance. It comes with two packets. One is seaweed and little chunks of mystery seafood, if you like seaweed you will want to use this packet. I love it because there is more then one kind one seaweed in it. The other packet is the soup/spice mix. It is hot and delicious. When I make this as just noodles I only use half the package, for soup you can chance the whole thing. Especially if you have a cold and want to clear out our sinuses. In fact, this is right up there with chicken soup as a great comfort food when you are sick and just want to sit on the couch with a hot bowl of soup and watch cartoons."
"This ramen noodle soup is much better than plain old Top Ramen or Cup Noodles. In the package is three things: the noodle block, the broth packet, and the vegetable packet. The Udon-style noodles are pressed together in a circle shape. They're thicker than regular ramen, and have a very slight chewiness to them when cooked. The red broth powder is in the foil packet. You can smell the spiciness when you open it. The broth is quite spicy, but only has a hint of a seafood flavor. Most of the ""seafood"" comes from the veggie packet, which contains a bunch of seaweed, green onion flakes, carrot bits, and shiitake mushroom pieces. You could say it's a Spicy Seaweed flavor instead of Spicy Seafood. Overall, it's some of the best ramen I've had.<br /><br />Oh, and Nong Shim gives both stovetop and microwave cooking directions on the package. Nice if you only have a stove or microwave available."
"I like these noodles much better than the box of Spicy Picante I got before. There is some spice to them, but not like the Picante, which I found too spicy and not very tasty. These have a great flavor to them!<br /><br />The noodles in this (Udon style) are also better; they have a nice fat shape to them and a good 'bite'. The veggie packet contains bits that smell like something you'd put in a fishtank, but taste amazing.<br /><br />I really didn't see any big deal with nong shim ramen until I tried these. I'll be getting another box."
"I love this one the most among Nong Shim noodle varieties.  I like it very spicy and this one is almost there. I can add a little bit more of chili peppers and it'll be perfect.  But again I like it VERY spicy (I""m asian), so for most people I think it's spicy enough.<br />Try adding an egg and some veggies to it and it's a great meal."
"I think these are good for a quick fishy noodle meal by adding an egg and some green onions.  But, I think a for similar(and I think better) effect would be to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE"">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a> with dashi stock instead of water.  Not sure if I will buy these again, but overall I think they are pretty good."
"I have been eating this specific type of packaged noodles for over a decade... well before Nong Shim products became prolific in so many U.S. supermarkets.<br /><br />This is my favorite flavor from Nong Shim. Here are some tips to turn this from a quick snack into a great, hearty meal:<br /><br />Use your favorite brand of chicken broth mixed with water. Add some or all of the contents of the seasoning into the chicken broth / water mixture. Wait for it to boil. Cook the noodles for about 8-10 minutes. Roughly 4 minutes after you put the ramen into the pot, add your favorite meat product if you're not a vegetarian. I personally prefer pre-cooked, seasoned ground pork or ground beef. Finally, put in an egg or two into the pot. The eggs will sink to the bottom so turn down the heat if you're adding the eggs to the soup.<br /><br />Be careful not to add too much of the red spice packet. People who love extremely spicy food add half the packet or more, but I recommend most people not to do this. Not only does the soup become undrinkable, but the spice packet is what includes the MSG. I usually sprinkle a thin layer of the red spice once before the soup boils and another time after I put the ramen into the soup."
"I started eating these when I lived in Korea, then was so happy to find them in Japan, then in the US.  They are pretty spicy, but if you love kimchi and fish-based Asian foods, then you should like these too.  Korean udon (thicker noodles like these) and ramyun are the BEST!<br />I also add other ingredients: rehydrated Shiitake mushrooms, tofu, shrimp or frozen seafood, more seaweed, etc.  These noodles really hit the spot on a cold night!"
Another great Ramen not really spicy or hot I add Dave's Insanity hot sauce to bring up the heat level. Great bargain!
"Stay away if you don't like spicy foods.  I just had my first bowl yesterday, it was great.  I can probably fool somebody that doesn't visit real ramen places with this.  Adding clams or imitation crab meat would be perfect!<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase<br /><br />***high sodium-don't drink all the soup"
"I've been a long time fan of the Nong Shim picante original noodles, they are of superior texture and the soup is actually spicy enough to kick the spot. I ran out of stock of them recently so I decided to order from Amazon, and try a different flavor. Amazon sells the 20 packs box about 4 dollars cheaper than my local Korean market, free shipping, and the noodles arrived within 2 days. Compared to the original flavor, I like Neoguri even more because of its thicker noodle and the soup base is more flavorful, thanks to the added seaweed, without reducing spiciness. The thicker noodle means you can cook it longer without worrying the noodles turn soft, a problem I frequently had with the original flavor (not to mention any other brand of instant noodles). Give them a try if you can tolerate spiciness!"
Ordered these on the hope they might be good. They are great. Nice serving size for lunch or dinner. Great heat and the seaweed add just the right taste. I highly recommend.
"Noodle was good quality, but that was to be expected for this price range.  I found the warehouse club brands to be much better buy.  For people with ""normal"" tolerance of hot food, I would recommend using half packet of this power in the noodle first, at most."
Hands down the best Ramen Noodles I have ever had.  If you don't like spicy food don't buy these because these are spicy and good.  Will def buy them again.
im a fan of korean food but i have never tried korean ramen until my friend recommended it to me. he introduce the saefiid flavor to me.. and wow the spicy is really kickin and the thick noodle is just so fulfilling. it may look weird but you cant judge a book by its cover right?!
"The first time I tried this I thought it was very tasty and very spicy. Now, after my 4th package, it is just very tasty and almost not spicy enough!  It definitely grew on me - very delicious and addictive!<br />I DO wish there was a low sodium version however; 1040mg of sodium in 1 pkg is just too much. (Are you listening Nong Shim?) Something with this much spice and flavor does not need as much salt so I will definitely have to eat them sparingly, if I can resist the temptation!"
"I liked these noodles a lot.  However, they are VERY spicy so I ended up using only 1/2 of the spice pack.  That said, I would still buy them again, and if you are a spice fan, they might rate a 5 for you."
"This is the best ramen noodles that I have ever had. The soup is very flavorful and fairly spicy. They are way better than the kind you get from most normal grocery stores and I don't have any asian markets nearby. I really like having the little vegetable packet too, it adds a great textural element. My only complaint about this is that the soup is very strong and very salty so I usually don't eat the soup that is left over after the noodles are gone, but I really don't need the salt anyway so I am still giving it 5 stars."
I wasn't impressed by the flavor; it seemed to lack sea food fishiness.<br /><br />Not very spicy either.
"I really like these noodles.  You have to boil them, because they're thicker than cup-o-noodles type ramen, but they're well worth it."
"I don't have a lot against these fast cook noodles, except that they never were intended as a quality product - and I think it's a little too late to start now.  I eat these - I always have some around and Yes, I bought these very ones right here on Amazon.  I keep them around mostly for a quick lunch ramen fix when I'm in the mood - and sometimes I use them as the noodle base for a quick stir fry - I'll admit, they're good for 100s of things, none of which are as good as when I make them the right way.<br /><br />I just have two thoughts right now -no, that's a lie, I've got lots more than two - but I try to limit myself - OK, thought #1: whenever I do have these 'ramen' type noodles (these are not udon noodles, these are ramen), my fridge always has lots of leftovers that would blow these out of the water - I'm simply in the mood, and besides, whenever I eat these, I add lots of other goodies, such as veggies and meats, and other 'helpers' - I don't ever remember eating this plain like it comes out of the pack - I can't imagine that that'd be good at all - this stuff needs some help!<br /><br />Thought #2: I can't help thinking that we've raised a generation of kids that have been cheated, when it comes to the introduction of ethnic food tastes - I think far too many moms who may have been well intentioned, simply marveled at how quickly their kids took to this 'foreign' food back in 80s and 90s - and since it was like, 10 or 15 cents a bag back then, hey, why go any further?<br /><br />This stuff was invented to be fast and cheap - and I'm sure its success far surpassed the expectations of its creator - but then, I'm sure he knew what real ramen tasted like, and this was never going to challenge that stuff!  And I wonder what will happen when the kids who grew up on Top Ramen get their first real taste of  real fresh ramen?  Kinda like an epiphany, I think.<br /><br />What we have here at best is an improved version of Top Ramen - it may be better than Top Ramen, but when I eat it, I still think of how much better the real stuff is than this."
"It figures.  I really love this stuff.  Unfortunately, I react badly to MSG (Monosodium Glutamate), really badly.<br /><br />I hope Nong Shim will create a more health-friendly version of Neoguri soon!"
The pasta was wonderful and the price was great! We used it for a Halloween Party main dish and it was a big hit.  I would definately purchase this again.
"Being a Southerner, I live on ice tea.  While I'd rather have a nice glass of fresh brewed ice tea, that is not always possible.  These travel packets are great for my desk at work and when I am travelling.<br /><br />I don't drink sugar, but like the sweetness this product provides.  And the hint of lemon doesn't taste fake.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1N2"">Lipton Iced Tea To Go, Lemon, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>"
"Hey this Iced  tea 2 Go has 2 Versions one with Splenda and no Warnings on the package and one with Aspartame & a FDA Phenylaline warning on the Box.<br /><br />I like the version of the product without a FDA warning on the side.<br /><br />Be sure you get the right product on this one, I was fooled too.."
"I bought this on special, thought it would be a good alternative for me than drinking straight bottled water all the time. I tried a few and didn't really like the aftertaste of the sugar substitute. But my wife and daughter loves them and finished the whole 12 (10 count) boxes, that's 120 individual packs of Tea. Now they keep asking for more, I know I'll end up get some but would like an alternative to the nasty aftertaste."
"I used to get it at BJ's, but they stopped carrying them for some reason."
I don't like the lipton on the go iced tea as much as crystal lights. It did arrive in a resonable amount of time.
Don't pay attention to the actual instructions to make this - as per theirs you'll end up with powdery/tasteless reconstituted poi.<br /><br />Add water and poi then let soak overnight - warm in pan (or microwave) while stirred - MMMMMMMM!!!
"I missed having poi with Hawaiian dinners now that I'm living on the mainland and thought I'd give the powered poi a try.  I was truly amazed that it was so very much perfect.  Easy to prepare for 2, 3 or 4 finger thickness and I will definitely purchase it again.  Please keep making this product."
"easy instructions, easy to prepare a nice addition to our luau, makes about a cup and half,as i remember, you can adjust to thin or thick, we made thick and served on tasting spoons."
"Obviously fresh poi is the best, but that's a little hard to come by in Kentucky!  I followed the other reviewer's cooking suggestion: I mixed it, covered it, and left it overnight in the refrigerator.  The next day I warmed it up on the stove and ate every bit of it!"
"This was very easy to prepare & tasted all right, although a little different than fresh poi (which is not really readily available in Texas).  I bought it specifically to feed to my infant son - not for food allergies, but to give him a variety of foods.  My only complaint is it doesn't last very long - it is a pretty small jar.<br /><br />And in case you're thinking of trying it, it doesn't freeze well.  I tried a little bit in baby food cubes and when thawed, it was too firm to thin out again to feed to baby."
"I cooked the Poi as suggested by the other reviewer, and let it set overnight. Warmed it up the next day and it tasted just like the real thing. Easy. Happy with this item."
"Poi powder is a decent substitue, but it's not as good as fresh or frozen.  If I had no access to frozen poi I would get this."
"These are the worst brownies ever.  I don't know what they were thinking (Milk Chocolate?)<br /><br />The were so un chocolatey, I ended up feeling like they were cutting corners, putting less chocolate in, and calling it a fancy new product. Decadent? Not so much.<br /><br />My family hated these so much, we threw most of the pan away rather than choke down the useless and unchocolatey calories.<br /><br />Really.  Don't bother."
"Pretty good, cause in a Keurig maker you can set it on small cup and then it is tasty. But caution if you use a Keurig dont use the large cup setting because this one will be very weak."
"I bought this almond flour because was the only one specified as made from blanched almonds. I received a 2lb bag of chopped raw almonds, but chopped with the skin. It's brownish, not white as pictured, and obviously the description lies, as they are not blanced.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
These people are wonderful to deal with. They called me with a question and were able to accommodate me with the greatest customer service. I was very pleased with their quick service and the wonderful quality of their product. Will definitely do business with them again.
"Love the Cheese Lovers variety pack! Easy to make and full of rich, cheese flavor. Each serving is 100 calories and has more than enough flavor to satisfy even the toughest cheese lover (that would be me) so that I don't have to add any extra butter or cheese (or calories) to enjoy the grits.<br />If you like cheese flavored grits, you will enjoy these. I would recommend them and will definitely buy more."
I was disappointed because I would not consider this a coconut flour at all.  It is more of a finely shredded coconut.  It would be difficult to get a bread-like texture with this.
Unfortunately this product did not meet my expectations.  When the jar was opened the aroma was not pleasantly earthy.  The consistency of honey was more like thin pancake syrup.
These are made of quality chocolate and are delicious. Underneath the foil is a piece of chocolate in the shape of a flower. Bought them for my daughter for Easter and they were nice because I could give her one piece at a time instead of handing her a giant chocolate bunny to ruin her teeth on. She was also delighted by the packaging and flower foil covers.
"The regular Extend Bars are great for controlling dips in blood sugar.  The regular bars do not have any sugar; however, all of the ""crunch"" bars have 10 grams of sugar.  The company should make that very clear in their product description!  I unfortunately purchased the ""crunch"" bars assuming they were like the other Extend Bars and now seeing that they have sugar in them, cannot use them."
The Extend bars are delicious not to mention they help control blood sugar levels.  A smart way to have a mid-morning snack.
"Extend bars work for Diabetics, they keep your blood sugar level without spikes or dip.  Probably would work well for non diabetics as well"
These are tasty but really sweet.  I didn't notice they made my blood sugar stable any longer than any other bar.  I might buy them again if the price was right.
". . . and it doesn't taste bad either. It provides a slow uptake carbohydrate that staves off hunger for hours. Since starting these, along with a couple of other not-very-difficult diet changes, my baseline sugar readings have declined by about 40 points. This is my favorite flavor; something like a moist brownie with crunchy stuff."
"I ordered these bubble gum coins for a Mario party-- to fill pinata with ""gold"" coins.  The coins are actually bronze and silver instead of gold and silver as pictured in the description online.  Disappointed and don't have time to order more."
"This is an ideal pre ground coffee of high quality beans for those coffee aficianados.<br /><br />Nice to have this in an office break room for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Works well with any sort of drip coffee mechanism and will brew that tasty special cup for full bodied coffee enjoyment.<br /><br />The taste is rich and complex with a kiss of vanilla to smooth it out.  very nice with or without sugar, milk, or cream. There is no bitterness.<br /><br />Overall, most likely all coffee drinkers will like this offering.  The excellent Melitta name assures that it is the finest."
"Ok, we all know people have different taste levels. You all know the people who grab the salt shaker and empty it over their already salty meal. I'm sensitive to flavorings and with some flavored coffee I just fill my cup almost to the top with unflavored and add a little flavored at the end. This Melitta is like that. WOW. I am totally unable to drink this package undiluted with regular coffee, it would have to be strongly diluted. The flavor is INTENSE and I think the cause of some reviewers saying the coffee is bitter or burnt. I don't think it's the coffee, I think it's the flavoring. I might try it later just adding a little to unflavored coffee but right now I have to rinse and rinse my mouth, which is still tingling/burning from the vanilla flavor. No coffee flavor got through for me.<br /><br />I do drink flavored coffee and like it, just can't recommend this brand. Oh, and the bag!<br />I was very careful trying to open it but ended up making holes so had to get the scissors and cut it.<br />I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I haven't tried adding a little to regular coffee."
"I woke the other morning to the soft slightly sweet scent of vanilla wafting through the house.  My boyfriend had made a pot of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8"">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>that I had just received!  I love flavored coffees and this didn't disappoint...even my boyfriend (who isn't a fan of flavored coffees but tolerates them) commented that the scent was attractive and the flavor mild."
"There were some surprises in this coffee for me. I made two pots, one a little stronger than the other, just so I could try it at different strength levels. Both pots conveyed the same essential characteristics. I poured cups for both myself and a coffee-loving friend, just to help ameliorate personal preferences, but we still quickly reached common conclusions with little discussion.<br /><br />First the vanilla... this brew doesn't really manifest a vanilla flavor. That aspect is more of an essence that quickly fills the room during brewing and which the nose encounters as one tastes it. I was actually expecting a significant vanilla flavor but I couldn't detect it much in the coffee itself, which was fine with me. It was a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I was quite surprised at the product page description which particularly boasts *no bitterness*, because this coffee conveys an edge like a wood rasp. I thought it was among the most bitter of all the premium gourmet coffees that I've tasted over the years. Is this due to the presence of *quakers* (underdeveloped beans which yield undesireable flavors)? I cannot say since this coffee is pre-ground. I can say that I ultimately dumped in some pre-warmed Half-and-Half to tone it back and I could still detect the bitterness, although not as prevalently.<br /><br />This brew wasn't hateful but it's not a coffee that I'd be interested in drinking in the future. But do not fail to try it based solely on what I have had to say about it. Lord only knows that the flavor of coffee is one of the most subjectively preferential beverages on the market so it might suit you just fine -- but not me."
"I enjoyed this coffee, but I'd say it's on the better side of decent.  I also sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Cafe Collection coffee recently and I preferred that variety.  There is a slightly odd, artificial taste in this coffee that I'm not thrilled with.<br /><br />To be clear, this is not bad coffee by any stretch.  It's fresh and seems to have a respectable caffeine content.  It is much, much better than a flavored coffee by Gevalia that I tried awhile back.  Certainly, you might like this a lot, as the vanilla taste, while not great, is not objectionable and the aroma is nice.<br /><br />I think that decent is a fair description and I'd give it a 3 star rating.  It's not a very expensive item, so if you're not sure, give it a try and decide for yourself."
"Having enjoyed the Melitta creme brulee, I thought I'd give this vanilla flavor a taste. I found it average and furthermore enjoy Folger's vanilla coffee much more. The flavor in this coffee was weaker than I would prefer. Also, they still need to do something about the packaging. There is too much glue holding it together and you need scissors to open it unless you want to be sweeping up finely ground coffee from every nook and cranny in your kitchen when it explodes upon trying to pull it apart."
"I recently tried and really liked <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3GC"">Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, and since French Vanilla is my favorite among flavored coffees I was eager to try their Parisian Vanilla ground coffee. I had mixed feelings on tasting it (though when it comes to flavors and coffee opinions can be very subjective.) Like the other Melitta coffee bags, this one was a bear to open.<br /><br />The flavor was not overpowering, as is the case with many other flavored coffee offerings. Most importantly the quality of the coffee itself is really quite good. The coffee was very smooth and lacked bitterness. Note their instructions and aim for 2 tablespoons per six ounces of coffee (not per 12-oz mug) or it will be weak.<br /><br />For my tastes the resulting flavor was a bit on the artificial side. It did not taste as much like vanilla I've had from other sources. That said, there were a few other positive factors about the coffee. First, both my wife and daughter independently walked in the room and said ""Wow, it smells wonderful in here!""  The aroma is indeed nice. Second, I made a large iced coffee for my wife with the Melitta Vanilla coffee and it turned out very nicely. (The expectation there was more for a refreshing flavored cold drink more than on the coffee taste itself.)<br /><br />If you're not a fan of flavored coffees, or shy away from them because of an artificial taste, this won't change your mind. If you sometimes like flavored coffee or like vanilla, it's worth trying, keeping in mind tastes are very subjective."
I have only tried this flavor but it's good! No need for additional flavour shots. It's perfect for a cool evening.
"Overall, this is very decent coffee. The smell when you open the bag is very strong, but the vanilla flavor of the brewed cup is mild. (Ok, it smelled BAD, like too strong fake flavor... but this didn't affect the brewed result as badly as one might suspect.) I think you'd call this a ""balanced"" blend... it is not very acidic or bitter with a medium color and is both fairly mellow and smooth in flavor.<br /><br />Good for a middle-of-the-road cup of coffee to be enjoyed any time of the day. Certainly not my favorite and could use more flavor, but still a good choice for those who enjoy a milder brew.<br /><br />I'd say: Worth giving a try."
"I just received this product that I gave to someone who is a genuine coffee hound.  While I am not a coffee drinker, I had the recipient give an honest, objective statement about it.<br /><br />That person said that the aroma was ""alluring and enticing"" and that the coffee was ""as smooth as high quality leather.""  This observation was followed by how ""smooth and gentle"" the coffee felt upon drinking it and that the vanilla added a ""light and refreshing touch."""
"Based on other reviews I see on Amazon, I guess I'm in the minority but I'm a coffee lover - way too many cups a day - and long ago moved from Folgers and Maxwell House. As a base coffee I prefer the smoothness of Colombian coffee and do sometimes drink a flavor. So I thought this coffee would fill the bill. But that was before it arrived.<br /><br />First things first: though Amazon's description says the beans are Arabica, the package itself doesn't. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The next thing you notice on the package is that the Vanilla is ""naturally and artificially"" flavored. What? Vanilla is a natural flavor. Why use ARTIFICAL flavoring?  (At least Amazon says it is artificially flovored in thir listing)<br /><br />Okay, so here is this hard-packed vacuum-sealed bag. You unfold the flap (with that metal band to reseal it, and try to separate the top to get to the coffee. Ever try to open those hard plastic clamshell cases they put electronics in and are frustrating at Christmastime? Well, the paper bag is just like it. It won't separate! So you need to CUT the bag to get inside and then you can't easily reseal it. (Maybe my bag was unusual but you can't return when it's open.<br /><br />Okay now we are the brewing stage. Vanilla is a nice subtle flavor (or should be) but when the hot water hit the grounds in my drip coffee maker the room smelled like I just sprayed it with Vanilla room deodorizer! It was that strong. (Maybe it was the added ARTIFICIAL flavor.). Okay, I then tasted the coffee and, yes, it was smooth but had little COFFEE flavor. It actually tasted no better than those low grade International Coffees that come powdered from Maxwell House.<br /><br />So, though I do use Melitta filters - and have used their bulk whole bean coffee from supermarkets in the past, I can't say this is a product I can recommend. (But then again, I here to drink coffee with a light flavoring, and expect the dominant taste to be that of ""coffee"".<br /><br />Steve Ramm"
"I enjoyed the Parisian Vanilla Ground coffee for it's full coffee flavor with a little hint of vanilla. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, but I definitely enjoyed this!"
"I do not usually purchase flavored coffee, but this Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee has been truly delightful!<br />At my church, I prepared the coffee for fellowship, and all of them asked what coffee was this! They were enjoying the aroma of the coffee and the taste of it.<br /><br />1. This is ground coffee, but it is very fine in texture. It could be used with both drip coffee maker and percolator. While both methods produce excellent tasting coffee, I realized that percolator produces far more rich taste of coffee.<br />2. The flavor is rich and tasty. The vanilla flavor is not too strong to dilute a coffee taste, but it is there. The balance is well kept.<br />3. The aroma is sweet but not overpowering. So actually it is very pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this coffee to anyone. Get your favorite book, relax, and enjoy the coffee!"
"I really liked this one -- it has enough vanilla flavor to be noticeable, but it doesn't taste like those overly sweet dessert-type coffee drinks (you could of course add more sweeteners/ flavorings).  The aroma while brewing it is delightful."
"I'm usually not too fond of flavored coffees--they usually smell wonderful and taste terrible.  This one is an exception to the rule.  The vanilla flavor scents the entire house, but at the same time, is not unpleasant or overpowering in the coffee itself.  The bold coffee flavor bursts right through, without bitterness, and the vanilla flavoring is just the perfect accent to the coffee flavor.  I drink my coffee with cream and sugar, but I still despise weak flavored coffee.  I want to taste the coffee too!  This one meets the mark on all counts, and while it won't be my ""everyday"" coffee choice, it is an excellent dessert or special coffee.  It's a buy-again product!"
"When I want flavored coffee, I want a really strongly flavored coffee. I want it to taste like candy. If that's what you are looking for, you should continue to look. If you, however, prefer a more subtle flavor (as is the case with my husband) you may enjoy this coffee."
"For this review, I shared the coffee with the rest of the company at our coffee maker in the kitchenette. I put up a simple feedback form, where I divided it into five columns to reflect each star. The middle column read ""O.K."" and to the left and right I put varying degrees of how much they liked this coffee relative to the Green Mountain Coffee we typically drink. On the average the result came O.K., so 3-stars are granted. I added one more star because when I opened the bag its rich aroma welcomed me and gave me a smile.<br /><br />The price per ounce is comparable to the Green Mountain Coffee."
"This. Coffee. Is. AMAZING.  It was so incredibly delicious I do not know what more to say.  We got it the same day we were having about thirty people over for a hymn singing, and every single person who had the coffee asked where we got this, it was that delicious.<br /><br />The only two people who are not that enamored with it are my dad, who has dementia (really), and my husband who likes his coffee black and unflavored.  Even he said that the coffee flavor itself was good enough that he would love to try it out if they have an unflavored, straight up and black coffee.<br /><br />I like my coffee sweet and loaded with cream, but usually I prefer to add the flavor with the creamer, as most flavored coffee beans have a chemically flavor that hits the back of my throat wrong.  This vanilla coffee tasted like the beans grew that way, mellow, naturally vanilla flavored.  It was just good stuff.  I also don't usually like ground coffee at all.  We buy organic beans and grind them ourselves as we need them.  Coffee made from the ready ground stuff tastes weak and insipid to me.  This didn't.  The coffee flavor was rich and full bodied, just also deeply flavored with delicious vanilla.<br /><br />Not overpowering, just incredibly delicious.  In fact, one friend called it dessert."
"Melitta's Parisian Vanilla blend hits all the right notes and makes a wonderfully smooth, luxuriant cup of joe.  The first thing you'll notice is the amazing aroma; a lovely vanilla with hints of cinnamon will meet your snifter, and probably cause some serious salivation.  (My wife said we could brew a pot just for the fragrance.)<br /><br />The coffee flavor is full and rich but not overpowering.  Like other Melitta blends I've sampled, it's very smooth with low acidity, albeit has a darker roast than most, approaching but not quite as ""burnt""-tasting as your average French Roast.  This coffee can be sipped, savored, and paired very effectively with pastries or dessert.<br /><br />If you like smooth flavored coffees, this should be a winner for you.  Enjoy!"
"The aroma is the greatest aspect of the coffee.  Literally once opened, the entire room smells of the rich vanilla.<br /><br />The taste itself is not too bold, nor too rich with vanilla.  It is a very smooth coffee that works well with breakfast or anytime during the day.  I would compare it to dunkin donuts coffee, however it is less bold.<br /><br />My only complaint was the bag itself.  While I was trying to open it, I basically had to cut the whole thing open.  To be fair, it may be that I just got an abnormally sealed bag."
"Fabulous coffee (especially when compared to the vanilla Community Coffee ordered previously!)The flavor is slightly different than what I would consider ""vanilla"" but it is still tasty and has a very smooth flavor."
"This review is for Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3). The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or crushed. The freshness of the coffee was OK, but it was obviously not recently ground due to a lack of intense aroma. I personally am not a big fan of the vanilla flavoring that has been added to the coffee, but it was still OK in terms of flavor. The consistency of the grind was acceptable, and I would classify the strength of the coffee to be medium darkness. Overall, I was somewhat pleased with the quality of this product."
"..but that being said, the actual taste flavor of the coffee is somewhat weak.  I drink coffee black and this Parisian Vanilla just doesn't have any guts.  On its own. So I started mixing it with my Kivu medium ground Costa Rican - now you have coffee heaven!  Mixed it with my VPP Espresso Blend Thai coffee - incredible!  I wholly recommend this Melitta Parisian Vanilla and will certainly buy it again if I can find it.  It's aroma has to be smelled to be beleived, and mixing it with other stronger coffees brings untold delight."
"I'll start by saying that I prefer flavored coffees.  I drink them black with sugar.<br /><br />Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee has a pleasant smell and a pleasant taste.  The vanilla smell/taste is strong enough to be noticed, but not strong enough to be overwhelming.  The coffee tasted smooth from the first sip to the last. I have been enjoying this coffee to for about a week before writing this review.<br /><br />My favorite flavored coffees are flavored coffees from Green Mountain. I would say that I enjoyed this coffee slightly less than my favorites. But I enjoyed it more than many other coffees, so I plan to buy it again.<br /><br />In this order you will receive three 11-ounce bags of ground coffee.  So the price per bag is very good.  The packaging was excellent.  The trick to easy opening is to pull the package not in the center, but towards one of the ends.  Then 1/4 of the bags opens, providing an opening which is just right for pouring.  When I tried pulling it from the center it did not budge.  I noticed that some previous reviews mentioned a problem opening, and I suspect that this is what they ran into. If you move where you pull on the package just slightly it will open very smoothly.  It was easy to reseal the package for storage.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this flavored coffee to those who like flavored coffees."
"Melitta is comparable to the richer Gevalia brands. Not much more to say. It didn't convert my wife away from her Gevalia but she's now mixing and matching it with Melitta brand because Melitta is a tad cheaper when ordered through Amazon Prime. Not recommended for fans of Starbucks - this doesn't have that dark, heavy flavor their known for (which is a good thing IMO)."
"I really enjoyed this pre-ground coffee!  I'm an extra-bold k-cup drinker, and prefer dark french roasts.  i rarely drink flavored coffees, even though i like the concept, because they taste a bit watered-down to me generally.  I used the Melitta Parisian Vanilla ground in the My-K-Cup filter that you fill yourself (to the top, and medium cup setting), and was very pleased with the result: a nice dark, strong coffee with just a hint of vanilla sweetness and smell.  I would definitely drink this on a regular basis- particularly with the k-cup prices going up lately!!!"
"My first cup began with a fairly pronounced chemical taste. As I proceeded through the cup, the effect went away somewhat, but but entirely.<br /><br />I don't normally drink flavored coffee, but this is not something I would choose to drink again, or feel comfortable serving to friends."
"OK, first lets start with the packaging. Forget about actually being able to pull the two sides apart at the top of the bag to get it open and just get the sissors out of the misc. drawer and cut the top off. Then of course it doesn't seal very well by rolling the bag down and bending the ends of the wire over that's stuck to the bag. There is no way to get anything even close to a seal. So before opening try to find something to put the coffee in after you get the bag open. I used an empty Ovaltine jar, (the Ovaltine would have made better coffee than this does).<br /><br />  When I opened the bag of coffee it had a distinct burnt smell to it with just a faint hint of vanilla hiding in it. It smelled the same as it was brewing in my drip coffee maker. From other flavored coffee's that I've tried I've got used to cutting it 2 scoops of flavored coffee to one of Folgers. This time I used some of the French Roast Folgers. Which was a waist of a scoop of good Folgers coffee. The directions on the bag says to use two level teaspoons of it for every 6 oz. of cold fresh water. I cant even imagine trying to drink a cup as strong as it would be brewed to those directions.<br /><br />  I've tried this coffee with just a little sugar the way that I usually like my coffee and it wasn't drinkable. I tried it with a little chocolate flavored creamer, then a lot of sugar and a lot of chocolate flavored creamer and it still wasn't drinkable. I would really like to have a nice cup of vanilla flavored coffee, but I'm not going to get one from this. No matter what I have tried with it, it still tastes burnt. I even tried it with some French Vanilla flavored creamer and it still tastes burnt.<br /><br />  I would really like to be able to say something positive about this coffee but I cant. I tried to brew a pot in my new;<br />  BUNN HG Phase Brew 8-Cup Home Brewer - even the Bunn coffee maker couldn't get a decent tasting cup of coffee from this, and it makes the best coffee I've ever had.<br />  Maybe this bag came from a bad batch that got burnt by being roasted too long. Maybe what ever puts the vanilla flavoring in it was almost out and it didn't get enough or as much as it was supposed to get. From all the other positive reviews I must have got a bad bag or maybe its because I was a heavy smoker for over 30 yrs before I quit smoking 3 yrs ago and I still have damaged taste buds. Something was causing this to produce undrinkable coffee and if it wasn't the coffee then it has to be something else making it taste bad. Unless you like coffee that tastes burnt don't waist your money on this."
"This is good coffee.  One thing I like about Melita coffees is that they are fine ground, so you can use less when making coffee and they work well with any method of making coffee, not just auto drip.  This is also a very reasonable price for the quality of coffee, much lower than equivalent coffees, especially flavored ones."
"This really surprised me by packing a rich, full flavor into a bag of preground beans. It was nice enough to drink black--something I only do with good coffee--and also made a lovely latte mixed with half vanilla soy milk and half freshly brewed coffee. The vanilla flavor is vivid, and it smells wonderful.<br /><br />I plan to treat myself again soon by buying some more of these."
"I enjoy a good, hearty coffee, but I found this blend to be nothing special over anything that I might find in my supermarket on any given day. I really wanted to enjoy it more."
I got this for the office.  I was hesitant at first because there are a lot of people who do not like flavored coffees but did it anyway.  This coffee has such a nice aroma that it won over even the firmest of critics.  It tastes wonderful and smells great.
"Tasty coffee.  Works well in drip coffee maker.  Smooth taste and nice flavor.  Remember it's preground, so don't expect fresh ground, recently roasted bean taste.  But it's a lot more convenient."
"I was a little worried when i first received this coffee ... afraid that it would be some weird sweetened coffee.<br /><br />My concern was unwarranted.<br /><br />This coffee has a light vanilla aroma that makes the whole house smell nice (assuming you like having a coffee smell throughout your house). Taste-wise it is very mild yet not wimpy, very much like a ""breakfast blend"" from any quality brand. Definitely not bitter at all.<br /><br />The flavoring is there, but not overpowering.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this coffee."
"As a fan of flavored coffees, I was excited to see this as an Amazon Vine selection.  I have been trying to diversify my coffee rotation, but so far, I am only a huge fan of Caribou brand Columbia and Dunkin Donuts brand Cinnamon Spice.  After tasting this, I will definitely be looking to try more Melitta brand coffees if I see them in stores, especially since the Caribou brand is becoming harder to find, for some reason.<br /><br />This coffee is very smooth tasting.  I don't understand how some of the reviewers found it burnt and bitter.  In fact, I had assumed from the taste that it was a light roast.  I don't like bitter coffee, which is exactly why I avoid dark roasts.  Additionally, this coffee has a very nice flavor.  Some flavored coffees are so weak that you can't even tell they're flavored.  Not the case here.<br /><br />There were a couple of things I didn't like.  I would have preferred the coffee to be less finely ground, since I use a coffee press.  But I have a strainer I can run it through when I pour it into my cup, so I guess that's a minor inconvenience.  However, companies need to take into consideration that not everyone uses a filtered coffee maker.  Having the option of coarser grinds would be appreciated.  Secondly, the glue used to seal the bag was so strong that I had to cut it open with a pair of scissors, ruining the bag and making it kind of pointless for the bag to have re-sealable tabs."
"Melitta has hit a home run with their Parisian Vanilla flavored ground coffee. As soon as you open the bag, you're hit with a nice burst of fragrant vanilla scent, paired with the delicious smell that (for me, at least), promises a bright start to your day.<br /><br />The Parisian vanilla flavor is strong enough to be noticeable, but subtle enough to not overpower the coffee flavor that I crave to get me going in the morning. It complements other flavors that are added with it, as well, so if you've got a favorite Hazelnut creamer that you're worried this will clash with, don't. The vanilla flavor in this coffee plays well with others.<br /><br />The coffee itself brews up sweet, strong, and not at all bitter. Melitta has created a collection that just gives you a good cup of joe to start your day with. And with flavor this rich, you just might find yourself leaving that sugar bowl alone. You really don't need it with this flavor in Melitta's Cafe Collection!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"This is less traditional coffee and more flavored drink like you'd get from a large coffee shop - filled with milk, etc. - except it's just coffee. The smell is extremely strong and the taste is similar - you get a lot of vanilla with some small coffee hints in the background.<br /><br />If you're interested in strong vanilla, this is it. If you want spectacular coffee, it'll make it - but it won't taste like coffee."
This coffee is amazing. It smells great. It brews nicely and it taste wonderful. I use it in a drip coffee maker and it has been great. I drink it warm or ice it and both ways are wonderful.
"If you like a strong vanilla flavor, you will like this. My kids loved it. I found it was perfect when I mixed about half of this with half ""plain"" coffee when brewing."
"Melitta is the sort of coffee you'd often find in a gift basket from a nicer department store or housewares store, and for good reason. The packaging is nice, the aroma is decent, and the coffee is so middle-of-the-road that it's likely to be well-received by just about anyone used to pre-ground national brands.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor tastes artificial, but isn't overpowering. The coffee itself is, again, a true medium roast. Light drinkers will probably go ""Ooh! That's a little strong."" while dark drinkers will probably say ""Well, at least it's not watery.""<br /><br />So, as part of a gift, you really can't go wrong (unless the recipient is a strict decaf person), but keeping it around regularly doesn't make much sense to me. Folgers French Vanilla tastes basically the same, and costs way less. Or, you can get better quality coffee by the pound for the same price at most coffee shops or grocery stores."
"It's a rich and flavorful coffee. An excellent choice for serving with dessert. I especially like mixing it with half a cup of hot cocoa, it makes a delicious mocha without having to run out to Starbucks."
"I enjoy flavored coffees, but often find the flavor overwhelming, artificial tasting or it leaves a bitter after taste.  This was none of the above.  It was just the right blend of flavor and coffee.  The smooth flavor of the coffee came through with just the right hint of natural tasting flavor.  I will definitely buy this is the future."
"I instantly fell in love with the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee as soon as I opened the bag and got my first whiff of the aroma. It smelled every bit as good while being brewed, and finally when I tried my first cup, I was met with a flavor that was exceptionally pleasing. This coffee has a nice vanilla accent to it that is neither too overpowering, nor is it fleeting. Very well rounded is how I would describe the flavor. It goes down very smooth, with no bitterness, and no odd aftertastes. I can see this coffee being a regular choice around my house. Add a bit of sweetener to it and really comes alive like a liquid treat in a cup."
"Bleh!  I am a flavored coffee person, but I really disliked this artificially (""and naturally"") flavored Parisian Vanilla coffee from Melitta-- it has an overpowering, heavy chemical flavor and aroma.<br /><br />The artificial flavoring of this coffee is just plain yucky, almost sickening-- I can just picture the ""food chemists"" at work coming up with this!  Truly, it does not taste like vanilla.  (Such an odd thing these days, that artificial fragrances and flavors are given names we associate with positive things--like vanilla--when they are nothing like the real thing!)<br /><br />I recently tried diluting this --1 scoop vanilla + two scoops of an unflavored Melitta coffee-- and it was STILL icky and overwhelming.  The packaging was surprisingly difficult to open and then reseal, too.  Not recommended!"
"I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffies but I liked this one a lot.  The coffee is ground so you have to use it quickly upon opening.<br /><br />The taste was very good.  Not quite as good as (I'm trying to be fair) [[ASIN:B001E5DYT4 illy Caffe Normale Fine Grind (Medium Roast, Red Band), 8.8-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)] but it stands its ground in the flavored coffee arena.  I would consider this a good morning coffee.  It a bit too much to drink all day long unless it's iced with dairy."
"I have tried other flavors of this brand of coffee and loved it, but I found that vanilla flavored coffee is not my favorite. The coffee is a little bitter; if you add some sugar or honey, it tastes fine, but if you drink sugarless coffee then this may not be your choice.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQRGG"">Folgers Gourmet Selections Coffee, Caramel Drizzle Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>"
I drink regular coffee with flavored creamer.  This coffee is not in the same league it is awesome.  It smells so good (if it tasted as good as it smells it'd sell like crack)  I like it.  I recommend going 50-50 with regular coffee I did and got a nice blend that hit me good.
"I prefer the robust blends of coffee. No cream, no sugar, just black bold coffee. Having tried Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee, and liking it, decided to give this a try.<br />The coffee comes packaged in a foil vacuum sealed bag. It is appreciated that vacuum sealing a foil bag maintains freshness, the bag is then shredded in an attempt to get to its contents.  Could use a packaging overhaul.  Smells delicious, but very sweet when you can finally get it open. The grind is perfect for my French press, and would also work well with a coffeemaker. I use the ""usual"" amount of coffee for brewing and the result is a smooth, if rather sweet, cup of  coffee.<br />Flavor: The coffee itself is smooth and flavorful.  The vanilla flavoring adds sweetness, which I don't particularly care for.  Perhaps if it was more subtle.<br />Acidity: A very smooth cup of coffee, which no bitterness, and no heartburn.<br />Use: This is a too much for me for my morning cup of coffee. The coffee, while flavorful with moderately intense taste, has too much vanilla for this to be a regular daily grind.  One scoop of this to about 3 scoops of something else would be just right for me.<br />For those of you who like a lighter, flavored coffee, you will probably love this. You may be able to skip your coffee additives and drink it black. It would make a nice after dinner coffee with dessert, keeping in mind the vanilla flavor (don't choose a dessert that will fight with your coffee)."
"The brand name didn't really attract me to this product.  With coffee I seldom go for big brands and love to try unique coffees from small independent roasters.  I have to honestly say, though, that this was one of the smoothest, most enjoyable coffees I have tasted in a long time.  This product proves the idea of trying something you wouldn't ordinarily try (like stopping by a local restuarant you've never tried just on a whim).  Sometimes you lose and sometimes you discover a jewel.  In this case I have discovered a tast coffee that I will definitely buy a quantity of from Amazon just to have it as my ""everyday"" coffee inbetween the more exotic flavors I experiment with."
"The minute you open the package you get a strong whiff of very sweet vanilla and the aroma fills the air while you're making it.<br /><br />It has a good taste, not sweet and very smooth and rich flavor.<br /><br />I really enjoy this coffee and the enhanced pleasures from it's delicious smooth taste. It makes that first cup of morning coffee such a delicious experience.<br /><br />Go ahead and indulge yourself."
"The better the coffee, the higher the price. So, even tho they say this coffee is grown in high areas of the world, dont bet it contains coffee beans from the hawaian volcanos, Jamaican mountains, or the Ethiopian highlands, even tho the coffee bag says the ""High Grown Beans"" are harvested from the ""Finest coffee producing regions around the world"" . Its 100% arabian coffee, like a lot of the coffee at the grocery store. It's got a great vanilla scent and aftertaste, but then again, its naturally and artificially flavored. So if you are a conneseseur of the finest coffees, and finest flavorings, you'll probibly pick up on this divergence between what the bag claims, and what the Amazon discription claims. However, if your palette is not so discerning, you'll not spot the difference. From my standpoint, MELITTA's PARISIAN VANILLA produced a good, solid cup of ""desert coffee"". It's smooth enough, but you'll probibly want to add sweetener and some cream or milk, to bring out the vanilla flavoring.  It did drink well, to the bottom of the cup, without becoming bitter. (Milk tends to keep Cafe au Lait from becoming too bitter, tho.) It smells wonderful, by the way."
"I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. Coming out of the bag, the smell is chocolaty and the vanilla aroma is very strong and pleasant. It produces a coffee that is smooth and creamy, with a thin layer of fine froth at the top when I made it in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264FT9K"">Bodum French Press</a>. I like my coffee piping hot with Half & Half and 3 sugars. The sweetness really brings out the vanilla flavor. Drinking it black, however, there's not much flavor to write home about. Without sugar and cream, it doesn't taste like either coffee or vanilla.<br /><br />The grind is extra fine. I was pleased by the small amount of the dust that passed through the Bodum and into my cup. For French Vanilla lovers, this is a very good price for 3 bags of coffee. The only gotcha is that it is ""Naturally and Artificially Flavored"" and not all natural. It tastes good, however. Lastly, the product is kosher, as indicated by the U symbol on the bag."
"Half the price of Starbucks, Melitta offers great value for coffee drinkers wanting a rich coffee with creamy vanilla and a sweet finish.<br /><br />To compare value, we tried Melitta and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ54H8"">Starbucks House Blend Coffee, Ground</a> which is available on Amazon for $29.59 (three, 12-ounce bags). Starbucks works out to 82 cents per ounce while Melitta is 55 cents per ounce (for three, 11-ounce bags).<br /><br />You can reduce the Melitta price further--to 46 cents per ounce--if you take advantage of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Hands down: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8"">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> is the better value.<br /><br />This coffee comes in an extra fine grind that paired well with our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X"">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a>. We detected no bitterness. We brewed two pots, one for home and the other I take to the office in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V4FM"">Thermos Nissan Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle</a>.<br /><br />I spike my Melitta coffee with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2"">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shots</a> in the afternoon to combat the after-lunch fade. Melitta's Parisian Vanilla is especially tasty as a substitute for or a complement to dessert after lunch or dinner.<br /><br />Rating: four stars. Buonissimo!"
"This coffee tastes as good as, or even better than anything Starbucks or any of the ""gourmet"" coffees I've tried, and costs about the same. Just smelling it in the morning will wake you up, and I love the light vanilla with a little milk and sweetener added. Even when I tried it black, there was no bitterness. If you avoid coffee because it's too acidic for your stomach, you should try this brand. I didn't taste any acidity and had no upset stomach afterward like you can get with some coffees-- especially if you drink it straight. I really like it and will definitely order more when I run out."
"Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee is good, but not great.  The coffee has a lovely vanilla scent when brewing, but the taste has a bit of an ""artificial"" flavor to it.  I regularly drink my coffee sweetened, with lots of added cream and a little vanilla.  With the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, I skipped adding the vanilla, of course.  It didn't taste quite as rich as the coffee made with pure vanilla extract, but it was a close second.<br /><br />Overall, Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee is a good dessert coffee that I'd recommend if you don't feel like mixing your own vanilla coffee."
"I love coffee.  While there is nothing wrong with most stuff that comes from a can, a great cup of flavored coffee or a nice blend of beans is the way to go in my opinion.  I've never been a big fan of the over roasted beans from Charbucks.  Seeing this was a vanilla flavored coffee with a blend of beans from the Americas, I was anticipating a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />My initial impression was one of frustration.  I am used to being able to open a bag of coffee like I would a bag of potato chips.  I worked on this bag for about 5 minutes and was not able to open it with my bare hands.  I'm sure one could argue it seals in freshness, but personally I thought it was annoying.  So out came the scissors.<br /><br />With the bag open, I wasn't particularly impressed with the bouquet.  There was a definite vanilla scent but not an overwhelming scent that I find in many bulk flavored bean varieties from the grocery stores.  What I did notice right off is that there was not a strong coffee smell.<br /><br />So the million dollar question is how does it taste?  Personally, I thought the first few sips were bitter.  However, the coffee is a mild flavor much like I would expect with a coffee made with beans from the Americas.  I did not detect any significant burnt flavor like you get with a typical dark roast.  I did not think the coffee was at all acidy.<br /><br />I personally did not find the vanilla flavoring overpowering (and I usually mix my flavored coffee half and half with a regular roast when I brew it).  As a matter of fact, I found the vanilla flavoring to be a bit odd.  To me, it did not really have a good vanilla flavor.  I thought it had a bit of a sweet characteristic with the flavoring, but there was no creaminess to it that I would have expected.  To be honest, it reminds me of adding the Splenda French Vanilla Flavor Blend to a cup of regular coffee.<br /><br />Overall, it was not a bad cup of coffee.  I think if the coffee had better flavoring it would be a very good cup of coffee.  I think this coffee is worth a try, but personally I will not be switching from my personal favorites for this brand.<br /><br />The one positive that comes to mind with this blend is with its low acidity, mild roast, and sweet moderate flavoring, it would be a good blend to serve a broad spectrum of people.  It probably would be a great choice for an office coffee maker or to serve at a party."
Upon opening the package I found the aroma quite strong so what we did was put one scoop of this to three scoops of regular coffee and it was absolutely wonderful.  I have also tried it straight as a latte and it was really really good.  Oh Yumm!  Latte's are my weekness and this coffee is going to be a favorite in that department.<br /><br />I don't know about the rest of you but I tend to mix and match my coffee's when brewing and I think that is the best way to have flavored coffee.  That is unless you like a strong flavor.  I also mixed this with some pumpkin spice coffee of another brand which I will not mention and oh my....love at first sight.<br /><br />I have tried this iced and hot and tend to like it iced better but it's summer so what can I say.  Will see come winter when I tend to drink it hot on how much more of less I like it.  If you really like flavored coffee then this is a great coffee for you.
"This has been a sweet change of  pace for me.  I don't normally buy flavored coffees. Usually I just want something strong and that's all.  This coffee brews strong, drinks smooth and is generally just great.  i will buy more"
I have tried their Hazelnut flavor and liked it well enough.  I find the vanilla to leave a bitter aftertaste whether I brew it strong or weak.  Can't really recommend this flavor.
"This is a very respectable coffee.  Brews well, has a great smell out of the bag and while brewing.  I just can't say it's that special from a flavored coffee standpoint.  Most of the time flavored coffee's come off overwhelming or under flavored to me and very hard to get ""just right"" and that's got a person to person preference to it.  In this case my wife thought it was a bit strong and I thought it was a bit weak.  We both agreed it's a good cup of coffee.  Overall no complaints, but no agreement in the household on it as a vanilla flavored coffee."
"This is good coffee - not weak, and not overly strong, but the vanilla flavor is a little strong for my preference. On the plus side, there was no funny aftertaste like many vanilla flavored coffees have. Simply put, if you like a strong vanilla flavor, this is a good choice for you. If you prefer the actual coffee to be the focus, and the vanilla to be more of a background note, this is not the choice for you."
"I really enjoy a nice cup of coffee with a hint of vanilla in the morning.  I usually mix my own concoction of a nice Colombian breakfast blend (3 parts) and a vanilla bean (1 part).  I figured I'd try the Melitta by itself before mixing my own brew.  I was PLEASANTLY surprised!  This is really good coffee.  I wish I had received the whole bean version instead of ground, but the flavor was delicious, with a low to medium hint of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring didn't intrude on the coffee's overall taste at all.  I found myself pouring a second cup right away.<br /><br />The coffee was so good, that the next day I didn't bother to mix my concoction either.  I just enjoyed the Melitta Cafe by itself.  Highly recommended if you like your brew mild with a hint of vanilla."
"I love this brand of coffee.  They make a ""Classique Supreme Ground Coffee"" which I really like.  So I was glad to try out their vanilla-flavored coffee.<br />-<br />It's ok.  I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees anymore - although at one point it was all I drank.<br />-<br />I should also start by saying that I use the Keurig coffee maker - you know that one-cup at a time thing?  The machine that's better than the Tassimo?  Well, the Keurig coffee maker I have also allows you to brew regular coffee by way of an adapter, rather than always having to buy those k-cup things.<br />-<br />So I tried this vanilla coffee.  It's ok.  I would say it was slightly weaker than the ""Classic Supreme"", and it may be due to the size of the grounds -  perhaps these grounds are larger than the ""Classic Supreme"".  I didn't think it had a very strong vanilla flavor, but it was nice.  I did like it - I just wasn't blown away.  I like it less than the Classic Supreme, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it!  I will still use it - this brand of coffee turns out really well when you use the Keurig coffee maker.<br />A mild brew."
"If Melitta doesn't sell good coffee, who does?  I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist), although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Parisian Vanilla  (extra fine grind) coffee from Melitta and it lived up to its advertising, ""Rich and creamy vanilla with smooth, delicately sweet finish.""  Mostly, I drink plain caffeinated coffee, however I enjoyed having a special coffee treat. Vanilla is definitely a great coffee flavor enhancer.  Although quite a brisk brew, the vanilla mellows the blend enough to satisfy my taste buds. I suggest controlling the heartiness by using slightly less than the recommended amount.<br /><br />If you are a fan of flavored coffees and feel like skipping Starbucks for a day, this coffee is for you."
I'm not big on flavored coffee....I like good old fashioned strong black coffee in the morning.  This vanilla coffee is not overbearing; it has just the right hint of vanilla.  Makes a pretty decent cup of coffee.
"I've never tried any of these flavored coffee's before so I wasn't sure about this, but decided to take a chance and try it.  And, I'm glad I did.  This coffee is very good.  It tastes wonderful.  And, it smells so good from the bag through the brewing process.  It's a keeper!"
"This coffee is absolutely fantastic. I wish I could attach a smell and taste sample to this review, because it deserves it!<br /><br />The vanilla smell is mouthwatering. It's not quite as strong in the coffee, but it's still present, and it complements vanilla creamers especially well. The coffee itself is smooth and entirely without bitterness -- it makes a smooth cup that is just wonderful.<br /><br />In terms of grind it's not too coarse, which is great because it seemed to last a lot longer. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />I received this coffee through the Vine program, but I plan on buying it in a few more flavors. My usual poison is Eight O'Clock and I loved this, so I'll recommend it especially to anyone who likes the Eight O'Clock Coffee varieties."
"Melitta Calfe's Vanilla ground coffee is an excellent flavored coffee.  I generally don not drink flavored coffees, but I found this one to a good taste, very smooth and not too bitter.  I have tried non flavored Melitta in the past and find that its generally smooth taste to be very complimentary to a flavored coffee.  I used the coffee in several ways.  I brewed a pot of just the flavored coffee and found the vanilla taste a little too much for me.  I later mixed the flavored coffee with a regular medium roast coffee and found it to be very nice with a good balance of flavor (I used two parts flavored coffee to one part regular).  You also don't need very much sugar with this flavored coffee. A good product that I would use again."
"Let me start with that I'm a heavy coffee drinker, primarily flavored coffees.  Vanilla is one of my favorites, normally.  This coffee is a real disappointment.  The main reason that I don't like this coffee is that the vanilla flavoring tastes odd to me, definitely artificial or even slightly metallic.  In addition, there is an aftertaste.  Price wise, at the current $8.72 per pound, this is no bargain either."
"This is an extra fine grind, so you don't need to use very much.  The ""roast"" of the coffee seems overdone, and the vanilla flavor is overpowering, such that this tastes more like burned vanilla than like coffee.  I suspect that people who like really strong, very dark roasted coffee will like it, but I do not."
"I'm a grind-my-own kind of guy, and I'm not much for flavored coffees, but I have to admit that this is very nice, and if you have it with the right food (like a nice piece of pie), the vanilla adds a little something extra to the experience.<br /><br />But the bag it came in...GRR!<br /><br />It's apparent that Melitta is trying to ensure freshness with the double-seal they used, but after trying for about 5 minutes and managing only to tear the foil above the seal, I gave up and cut the bag with scissors.<br /><br />In other words, you'll need a canister if you want it to keep this coffee fresh, because, unless you have more luck than I did opening the package, storing it in the bag is not an option."
"I'm not big on coffee but I thought the Vanilla would make it more mild.  It definitely made it milder and I made a milkshake with it and YUM!  Hubby, on the other hand is a serious coffee drinker.  He drinks it black and he likes it strong.  He takes a thermos of coffee to work with him every day.  He tried this and says in his opinion it makes a great weekend coffee.  It's got a sweetness to it that he doesn't want to drink while he's at work but he really likes it for days when he's not going for strong, black, keep him awake coffee.<br /><br />The sweetness of it isn't overwhelming and makes for a good dessert coffee or would be good with breakfast on a cold winter morning!"
"I'm very skeptical when it comes to buying flavored coffee. Most Flavored coffees that come in flavors I like are just terrible, so I just usually add flavored creamer to solve the problem. And I like my coffee flavored. So when the offer to sample this came along, I said ""what the heck? I'm not paying for it"". I didn't except much based on my previous disappoinments with other flavored coffees. I was so wrong<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8"">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> is jammed packed with a delicious vanilla flavor that's so good, it doesn't need anything  added to it, except maybe a little sweetener<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor doesn't over power the coffee flavor. It's blended perfectly. There's not much more I can say except this is really good vanill coffee.<br /><br />There is however one issue other than the bag being difficult to open - It tastes really terrible cold.<br />I do enjoy iced coffee every now and then. When I gave this a try cold, it tasted different, in a bad way<br /><br />Other than that, this is excellent coffee"
"I loved it even as I opened the package to be greeted by my first whiff of amazing vanilla. Finely ground, it is roasted to avoid all bitterness and succeeds! Smooth drinking and aromatic after brewing in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037ZG3DS"">Mr. Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker</a>. Clear instructions should be followed - 2 tsp per 6 oz of water for best results. Small, vacuum sealed, bags mean your coffee won't go stale before you can enjoy it all - and the old-style bend tab closure works well to seal on the fly. I'm definitely hooked and want to try other Melitta coffees now."
"I love this Melitta coffee.  I'm a big fan of Melitta coffees in general, but this one is fantastic.  First of all it smells fantastic as it's brewing. It fills the entire house with a beautiful vanilla aroma.  I normally put some creamer in my coffee, but for my review I drank a cup black.  The coffee is very smooth and has no bite to it at all.  Even without cream, it has a very creamy texture to it.  It's bold without being overpowering.  I highly recommend the Melitta Parisian Vanilla coffee.<br /><br />Separately, my husband drinks coffee every day but does not appreciate coffee the same way I do.  If you're this type of coffee drinker I recommend saving your money.  While my husband loved the aroma of the coffee, he didn't even notice the difference in flavor between his usual generic brand of coffee.<br /><br />Great for coffee lovers, ho-hum for an average coffee drinker."
"I have always wanted to try Melitta Coffee, so I jumped at the chance to sample this product. I have to say, it is one of the best coffee blends out there. I love the aroma...it has a strong vanilla odor but it is not overwhelming. The way the coffee smells out of the package is exactly what it tastes like. This is a very bold brew with a satisfying vanilla flavor. It is a darker and full-bodied brew, and I loved how smooth it tasted. I highly recommend this flavor to anyone thinking of trying it."
"PROS:<br /><br />The vanilla flavor did not overpower the coffee taste at all, it was actually quite balanced. A lot of flavored coffees go overboard with the concept and thus have a tendency to taste artificial, but this particular blend kept it's perspective.<br /><br />The coffee had a rich, dark grind but brewed up like a good breakfast blend. It had a nice aroma right out of the bag and made for an inviting smell in the kitchen as it brewed.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The bag was impossible to open without cutting. The restrainer tie broke off after about 6 uses and I had to use a bag clip to keep the bag closed. In other words, they used GREAT glue to seal in the freshness, and then used an adhesive that was about as effective as old bubble gum to help KEEP the coffee fresh once the bag was open. Can't quite figure out the engineering on that one.<br /><br />PRO AND A CON DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT:<br /><br />This coffee, like ALL Melitta coffees has a VERY fine grind. It's made for drip coffee makers that use a filter, which is no surprise since Melitta takes credit for inventing the modern paper cone filtration system used in basket filter coffee makers. An extra fine grind means that you can get away with using a bit less coffee, but it also means that you can't use something like a Bodum press to brew this coffee.<br /><br />OVERALL IMPRESSION:<br /><br />A solid 4-star coffee. The frustration with the packaging kind of got to me, but once you get past that, it's pretty good stuff, and well worth it if you like flavored coffees."
"I enjoyed this coffee very much, but I think it's important to be clear about the details of the taste, and how to brew it for maximum enjoyment.First, this coffee has a full bodied flavor similar to French Roast. The taste of the coffee itself is deep & rich. As such, the vanilla flavor is subtle. It's not as ""prominent"" as flavored coffee you buy in the supermarket (that coffee tastes ""heavy & fake"" in the flavoring department). If that's how you like your coffee(with heavy flavoring and less ""coffee"") you will NOT enjoy this coffee. This isn't the cheap Vietnamese coffee that everyone's been drinking since most companies have stopped using Columbian coffee. Vietnamese has a very lightweight flavor (no ""body"") and takes on a much stronger taste with artificial flavoring.<br /><br />This coffee doesn't taste quite as good when percolated through an electric machine. It's still great...but the flavor gets diminished this way. Try a French Press or better yet, a ""pour through"" gadget (see the manual coffee maker below) made by Melitta... instead. This way of making it makes a coffee that...well....blew my socks off.<br /><br />For coffee addicts & lovers...you'll understand this coffee. For those who think Yuban is great, probably NOT. Personally, I loved it and will be back for more. I would have given it 5 stars if the taste was the same with electric brewing as it was with more ""rustic"" methods using boiling water. As it is..making it by the cup made alot of difference and that's why my review gives it 4 stars instead of 5. Most people will use an electric coffee maker, and depending upon the brand (Krups would probably be ok) it may be less than superb.<br /><br />This is the ideal pot to use for this coffee:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Manual-Coffeemaker-10-Cup/dp/B000MIT2OK/ref=pd_sim_k_3<br /><br />I use the one cup size for myself, and that's handy for me.<br /><br />*This coffee is ground very fine and is ideal to use with a manual coffee maker.*"
"I'm kind of a coffee snob,I am very selective and and I won't drink crappy coffee. I gave up on the stuff at the local supermarket decades ago and since the 80's I've consumed mainly Gevalia coffee because I like my coffee STRONG but never bitter,always smooth with great taste.<br /><br />In the past year after reading the coffee reviews here at Amazon,I added Douwe Egberts to my daily coffee rotation and now the tasty Melitta Cafe Collection coffee has now joined my personal lifestyle.<br /><br />I like my coffee two ways,hot during most months and over ice with milk during these HOT summer months and I've tried this Melitta both ways and it's a real tasty winner.<br /><br />I'm very selective about flavored coffees because of a bad Gevalia experience a couple years but Vanilla seemed a safe bet so I checked it out and it's a real winner. It's a very subtle,not an overpowering flavor and I find it to be a true delight each day.<br /><br />I look forward to trying some of the other Melitta coffees after this great discovery!"
"This is a smooth and mild premium coffee blend, much nicer than basic Folgers and more on par with the Dunkin' Donuts French Vanilla coffee you can buy in the supermarket. It's not a gourmet brew, but it's better than many of the store brands out there."
"Typically I do not like flavored coffees, but this one is the exception.  It has a deeply fragrant aroma that is just simply heavenly.  I thoroughly enjoyed this blend and intend to buy some without hesitation.  If you like vanilla, you will be crazy over this coffee.  It is great in the morning, or as a after dinner treat. What a nice treat! In fact, I have to go make a pot now! Talking about it is making me want it.  It is especially good with a little fresh whipping cream. Buonissimo!"
"Normally I like my coffee to taste like coffee. I've never been a fan of flavored coffee. Surprisingly, I liked Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla. The vanilla flavor is not overpowering, or overly sweet. I did notice a long vanilla aftertaste. Some people may enjoy this. Some may not. I actually enjoyed the smell of it brewing more than the taste. I did enjoy drinking it though. It's not a coffee I'd want to drink everyday instead of regular coffee, but for a change every now and then, I like it. Fans of flavored coffee will probably enjoy it more than I did. If you're used to drinking your coffee 'black, no sugar', this may not be the coffee for you though."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this vanilla coffee. Honestly, I avoid vanilla coffee like the plague because I usually find it bitter and acidic. However this coffee was bold, but smooth. The vanilla taste was stronger than I prefer, so the next time I make it, I think I will use 1/2 vanilla coffee and 1/2 unflavored coffee. While I like this, I still prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV38A"">Melitta Cafe Collection Vienna Roast Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>. The Vienna Roast has a more pleasant taste and I plan to order more.<br /><br />Two slight inconveniences are the following: opening this package is like trying to break into Ft. Knox. However this is probably because it is vacuum-sealed. So plan to use scissors when opening it. Also, note that this coffee is very finely ground, so it won't work with a French press, unless you plan to chew some of your coffee. However, particularly with the Vienna Roast, I felt like I got French roast taste with my bottom-of-the-line drip coffee pot.<br /><br />One thing I discovered about this coffee is that brewed double strengh and blended with milk, sweetner and ice, it makes AMAZING frappucino. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars. It is officially my favorite frappucino coffee!"
"I am a coffee addict and very particular when it comes to coffee. The Melitta brand doesn't disappoint. It may sounds cheesy, but this is heaven in a bean. So rich, tasty and delicious to the point I can't stop drinking it. Also, Melitta is affordably priced and gives you a nice buzz that can sometimes be lacking in other coffee brands. A much recommended coffee that I urge everyone try.<br /><br />Katiebabs"
"This coffee was delicious. It's very smooth and has great flavor. The package was super hard to open (I had to cut it), but I don't know if they're all that way or if it was just mine. Regardless, I would highly recommend this coffee!"
"I've got to admit that I prefer non-flavored coffees. So for the purposes of this review, I elicited the opinions of my wife who prefers flavored coffees. So what follows are her comments...<br /><br />I thought the Melitta Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee came in a really nice, high quality bag. I enjoyed the subtle swirl pattern on the bag and it just elicited an overall impression of European quality and luxuriousness. The little tabs that enable you to close the bag are a bit longer, and heavier duty than those found on other coffee bags that I've used. Keeping air out of the bag is important and this bag helps you to do that. The coffee would make a nice gift to another coffee lover because of the appearance and quality of the bag itself.<br /><br />And I haven't even gotten to the coffee yet... I thought the flavor of the Parisian Vanilla coffee was quite smooth, rich but with a small amount of a bitter aftertaste. Not so much to make it objectionable but enough to prevent me from giving it a full 5-star rating.  I make my coffee in a Keurig machine (with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and am very happy with the results. It works really well in my Keurig. Sometimes with other coffees, the grind isn't quite right, either too fine or too coarse and the Keurig can be picky about that... too fine a grind and the filter will plug up and the Keurig will labor while trying to push the water through the grounds. Too coarse and you don't get enough coffee flavor and the coffee is ""thin."" No problem with the grind of the Melitta coffee. Even though it is labeled as ""extra-fine"" it works perfectly in the Keurig.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy this coffee. The balance in flavor between the coffee and vanilla is just right. The grind is perfect for use in my Keurig and the packaging is of high quality.<br /><br />Thanks wife... husband now takes over... although I prefer non-flavored coffee, I did enjoy this coffee as well. It wasn't overly ""vanilla-y"" and had good overall taste in mouth. I agree with the bag comments that my wife made and I also give this a 4-star rating which makes things a lot easier."
"I tried this product with my mother-in-law one morning and LOVED it!  This coffee is strong without being overpoweringly so, and is great for use as either a breakfast or dessert coffee."
"The Melitta coffee has a bright vanilla flavor, not overpowering but well-balanced.  My only reservation is that the underlying coffee itself is not excellent.  Most of us will not notice."
"I'm an old-fashioned kind of coffee man - good, strong, black - sometimes with cream and sugar, but rarely do flavored coffees do it for me or satisfy.  I made a pot for friends and they oohed and ahhed over this stuff.  I tried a cup in lieu of dessert (with cream and sugar) and found it had a vaguely creme brulee type of taste that I found delicious!  Quel surprise!<br /><br />Getting the vacuum packed bag open was a bit of a chore (more easily accomplished with a pair of scissors), but I'll be getting this stuff again - and maybe not just for guests!"
"This coffee was very popular at my work.  Since I only drink a moderate amount of coffee myself, I brought it to the office and my co-workers loved it.  I also had mine over ice and liked it this way as well.  I don't enjoy very strong coffee and even avoid some coffee places as they tend to taste strong and bitter; this had a very good taste the way I drink it - black with a 2 Truvia sweetener packs. I also like McDonald's coffee so don't hold that against me. :)"
I just made myself a cup of this coffee and I think I found a new favorite brand. When I opened the bag I noticed the pleasant vanilla aroma which wasn't too sweet and overpowering like other brands. I used my french press to brew the coffee which I wouldn't recommend. The grounds are extra fine and the filter doesn't completely seperate the liquid from the grounds. I mixed the finished cup of coffee with some milk and it tasted just like flavored vanilla coffee but without the syrup or sugar. I really liked the taste it was mild but without any traces of bitterness. Definitely a good alternative to my usual starbucks coffee.
"I love Melitta products and have reviewed two other flavors in the Caf&eacute; Collection.  This time I chose French vanilla.<br /><br />I admit to being a coffee snob.  My coffee must be perfectly brewed and strong, so I use the almost antique ceramic Melitta filter and make it one cup at a time<br /><br />Surprise, surprise!  The Parisian Vanilla flavor is richer and much better tasting than the Creme Brulee which seemed artificial. While the grind is a little coarser than I normally use in a Melitta filter and the coffee color a lighter brown than my Black Magic beans, I found it made a decent-actually good-cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I prefer a stronger, darker brew, but if medium-strength good coffee with flavor is your bag, this is the one to try. I recommend at least two heaping scoops (regular coffee scoop) per 8-ounce cup.<br /><br />One and one half thumbs up."
"Melitta is a well-known name in coffee in the European tradition.  It is known for dark roasted, full bodied coffees and this is part of their new line.  The flavor doesn't disappoint.  It is strong without being bitter.  I drink my coffee black and the Parisian Vanilla has enough depth of flavor to be satisfying all on its own."
"The vanilla flavor is there but not overpowering. I use cream and sugar with my coffee and the combination works well, which isn't true of all flavored coffees. With h&h and sugar the taste is very smooth and ""polite"". But it's decent black as well. There's no sweetness (sometimes a problem with vanilla and hazelnut flavoring, and the result can be cloying.) It doesn't seem to provide a massive caffeine jolt; morning java addicts beware.<br /><br />The only negative is the bag, which is so firmly sealed shut that pulling it open is barely an option and would probably result in a mess. It's best to cut it open and store the coffee in something more manageable."
"I'm not an expert on coffee, but I know that I really liked this one.  I was afraid that the vanilla flavor was going to be too strong or artificial-tasting, but it wasn't.  This Melitta Parisian Vanilla coffee had a really pleasant vanilla taste and aroma, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.  :)"
"Do you enjoy a well-roasted bean, neatly packaged for ease of optimal enjoyment?<br />This is not for you.<br />Have guests with cheap taste, less interested in Blue Bottle than impressed by things posed as European-ish?<br />This product ain't gonna solve that problem. In fact, its not likely to satisfy any need or want or whim.<br /> This is only barely passable as coffee.  It smells like flavor crystals, tastes like %#**, and unless you're like me and throw away the remainder after three whole investigative cups-worth, will put a stench on your storage vessel of choice.  The bag is crappy plastic + a weensy hint of mylar, with slippery not-tape: unresealable.<br />Which turned out, in my case, to be as fine as the 1/3 fulfillment, noted neither in the offer nor the box: I got one bag, despite the '3 bags' labels everywhere. The total snoot in me wishes they hadn't even manufactured 3 bags of this heavily perfumed reddish-tan dreck, and kind of thinks Melita owes my brewing-rig a bottle or three of vinegar."
"I'm not usually one for flavored coffees, but I've had some good ones - sadly, this really isn't one of them. The vanilla is artificial tasting and while the brew is smooth enough, it has a mildly medicinal flavor that should be richer."
"My bag of Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee has been a pleasant treat these past few days.  The coffee's strength and complexity sits somewhere between a ""normal"" cup of coffee (the kind you might get at Dunkin Donuts, for instance, or brew from your supply of canned supermarket coffee) and more rich and complex ""coffee house"" style coffees.  In other words, this is great when you want a basic cup of coffee, but still with a hint of something extra.  Actually, you get two ""something-extra"" hints here: a shade more complexity than regular coffee, and the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />It's sometimes said that one should avoid flavored coffees because their manufacturers often use the flavor to cover up lesser-tier beans.  I don't think that's the case here.  The vanilla is (happily) subtle to begin with, but regardless, it's pretty apparent that the coffee itself is of high quality.  It's rich and flavorful, with a burnished, non-acidic finish.<br /><br />And just to be clear, it's not a sweetened vanilla flavor that's used here, just a subtle undercurrent that slightly enhances your coffee experience.  You can add your own sweetener if you want a sweet vanilla taste.  Myself, I just add a little half-and-half and I'm happy.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees on a regular or semi-regular basis (I'm more in the latter camp), this is a fine product to pick up and add to your cupboard.  Even if you like a flavored coffee only occasionally, you may use this up faster than you think."
"I've had many brands of vanilla coffee, and the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground holds up well against the others. It's very smooth and pleasant, with clear vanilla flavor. I love it with honey and cream.<br /><br />Everyone else that tried it (all daily coffee drinkers) found it enjoyable, and particularly commented on the aroma. No one had anything bad to say about it."
"This may be the best-tasting flavored coffee I've ever had.  Most flavored coffees are too sweet for me - especially hazelnut flavors - so I have to cut them with plain coffee.  Others have so little flavor that I have to add milk or sugar to coax it out.  But I tested this one straight up and unaltered, so I could write an honest review, and it's a home run!  (I have a Krups drip coffeemaker, if that makes any difference to anyone.)  My husband and I both take our coffee black, and we sucked down the whole pot in minutes.  Perfect balance of vanilla and coffee flavor.  Yum!!"
"I knew the moment I opened the pouch, smelled the aroma and got that body tremor that this was going to be really good coffee. And it is. Very smooth, even though I like my coffee strong, with no bitter or acidic taste. I would say it leans more towards the fruit side of coffee then the wood side. The vanilla adds a nice touch and is not over-powering. If you like Maxwell House coffee then try this coffee (because Maxwell House is terrible). Also Melitta doesn't leave your breath smelling like you've been chewing on an old gym sock (not that I've ever done that). Find out what real coffee is supposed to taste like. It's also a good price for quality coffee.<br /><br />Note: As you can see above I received this coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I am however still being truthful. If I didn't like this Melitta coffee I would have said so.<br /><br />I wonder what FBI Special Agent Patrick Bowers would think of this coffee."
"As a died in the wool coffee drinker, I regularly consume 3 to 5 cups a day.  (Yeah, yeah, I know too much caffeine is bad for you.)  Luckily, my employer provides my morning fuel at no cost to me, even if it is just plain old Folger's.  So it is particularly noticeable to me when I drink a coffee that is flavored or of another brand.  Well this Melitta Cafe coffee happens to be both.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag I smelled a smooth and creamy scent of Vanilla along with the pleasant aroma of fresh, rich coffee grounds.  I knew I was in for a good cup of coffee because there was nothing bitter or acrid about the smell of the grounds.  You make enough pots of coffee and you can just tell.  So Melitta passed the grounds whiff test.<br /><br />But the real measure of any coffee is the aroma and flavor after brewing, right?  Just as a point of reference, I drink my coffee black and on the strong side of medium.  The Melitta Vanilla is nothing but a pleasure to drink.  It is a smooth coffee without a hint of the harshness or bitterness that comes from lesser coffees.  Thankfully, the vanilla flavor is pleasant without being overpowering or obnoxious.  You still know you're drinking a cup of coffee.  While I am a traditionalist in the sense that I prefer a straight unflavored coffee for my everyday consumption, this is a nice treat and welcome change of pace.  Great for company or just something different from the ordinary."
"My wife and I have tried a lot of olive oils and this Olio Taibi Biancolilla is just to die for!  It has a very luxurious mouth feel and, like a fine wine, you find yourself discovering and remembering different notes of flavor long afterwards. One of life's true small pleasures!"
"Like the title says, this olive oil is absolutely fabulous!!!!!  By far the best I've ever tasted.  We used it for dipping bread and no one at the table could get enough, including my kids.  We almost forgot about the rest of the dinner!!"
"Have you ever thought you could get lost in a dip of extra virgin olive oil? Try the Taibi Biancolilla and feel the experience. The first time I tasted it I had to ask my guest to repeat what he was talking about because I was completely ""lost"" in the sweetness, fruitiness, delicateness of this wonderful oil. I would dearly recommend you try also the Taibi Nocellara extra vergin olive oil at the same time. They are siblings, they both come from Sicily and they are so different! The Nocellara with his strong erupting personality is volcanic.<br />The Biancolilla, like its name,  is a beautiful poem."
"I've tried a lot of high-end olive oils and Monocultivar Biancolilla is near the top of my list.  This oil has a true pedigree because it comes from a single Sicilian organic farm and is cold-processed which differentiates it from other olive oils.  Most other olive oils are blends consisting of cheaper tasteless oils from places like Spain or Portugal.<br /><br />Store brand oils are virtually tasteless but are fine for cooking.  Others disagree and would use this liquid gold in everything.  They're probably the same people who cook with $50 bottles of wine. Olive oil in general is not so great for frying since it has a low smoke point and burns easily. Extra virgin olive oil smokes/burns at even a lower temperature. In other words, this is an oil best used cold. It's great for dipping bread, salads and as a finishing oil on soups or vegetables.<br /><br />This oil has a little bite and is packed with flavor.  It compliments, as oposed to overpowers, your food.  I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />The farm where this oil comes from is relatively small and produces under 10,000 liter of oil/year.  This accounts for the high price.  If you want a less expensive oil that is almost as good try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9N4Q"">Olio Carli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 500ml Bottle (0.5 liter) by [...</a>].  A quick web search and you can find 3 liters for thirty dollars and free shipping.  I can't post the link but if you find their website add a slash offer to the address.<br /><br />One last thing: Extra virgin olive oil by definition has to contain a minimum percentage of EVOO.  The rest is just regular olive oil.  Monocultivar Biancolilla use a much higher percentage of EVOO than is required resulting in a superior product.  Keep in mind that Italy produces twice the amount of olive oil than they have trees for because they import and package cheaper oils -- technically they are Made in Italy."
"The oil is good, and I appreciate the fact the olivers are from a single source, however, I don't see it as header and shoulder above other organic extra virgin oliver oil. I'm not an expert in EVOO, but I compared this item with organic EVOO from Costco tasting side by side and I really can't tell the difference, or feel that this product is any better. However, the Costco version is $19.99 for 2 huge bottles."
"Taibi Biancolila is absolutely a world class olive oil.  There is no doubt that the competition is stiff, but this small operation in Sicily deserves to be noticed.  I have somewhat systematically taste tested olive oils throughout Italy (mostly in Tuscay and in Sicily) through many years and this really does rank amoung the best.  Considering it is such a small farm, we are lucky to be getting here in the states."
"We have been a fan of Oliotaibi oils for several years now.  We have purchased more than forty bottles of oil over the years and have never been disappointed, since all have been of the finest quality, with a rich taste and excellent consistency.  Perfect for salads, or for dipping bread, or drizzling over buffalo mozzarello. Glad to see the product is now available through Amazon, which makes order processing even easier.  Well worth the price."
"We fell in love with the oil, we have now re-ordered it several times. It has a great flavor and not overpowering.  Perfect"
"i have vacationed in Italy and visited a few wineries. fortunately most italian wineries also produce olive oil, which is great since i don't like wine. i did enjoy olive oil tasting and they make great gifts to send back home to family and friends. Monocultivar Biancolilla ranks very good. i was able to detect the fruity taste and it was mild, i don't like strong tasting oils."
"Coming myself from the Near East, every time I try Taibi's olive oil I become homesick. Its full taste and authenticity captures some of our Mediterranean harsh light which contrasts so strongly with the shade given by the olive groves and vineyards. This ever strong light forces us to squint and focus our sights on what is at-hand; what is on the plate and consequently taste is sought after like shade in mid-day."
"With a husband who loves olive oil, I have tried my fair share.  But this one is different.  It has an amazing flavor that is both distinguishable and complementary.  So far, we've used for bread dipping, and we've drizzled over tomatoes.  Simply delicious!  Can't wait to try in other ways, too.  It is definitely well worth the price and I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IAPXS4"">Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 100% Organic Certified, Monocultivar Biancolilla</a>!"
"Simply delicious. Complex flavor with a hint of tartness. Works wonderfully on it's own, on salads or vegetables or in dishes. Ideal for any context except very high heat."
"It is always wonderful to taste a really good extra virgin olive oil, which can enhance so many cold and hot dishes. In truly exceptional cases, such as this one, even by itself on a piece of grilled bread, it can produce a simple, almost trivial, yet mouth watering and flavorful appetizer. A really great extra virgin olive oil!"
"My husband and I were served Olio Taibi ""Biancolilla"" at a dinner party tonight with rustic bread and fresh tomatoes - in a word...Amazing.  This olive oil is flavorful, yet smooth and delicate.  Contrary to the review above, I think Biancolilla would be fantastic in salad dressings and great for bread dipping.  I look forward to giving bottles as gifts this holiday season!"
"I only buy Mediterranean cold-pressed olive oils and definitely like this one. It's smooth yet definitely has that ""choke"" factor, or bite as some say. But it's not too much. It comes after a delay and quickly passes. Probably best suited for dipping bread, etc, and not so much for, say, salad dressings."
This is super light with a wonderful flavor.  I am already half way through the bottle.  I love trying olive oils.
"I consider myself a bit of a foodie, and recently returned from Provence where I sampled many olive oils from that region. They were for the most part delicious.<br />I enjoy Italian olive oils also and so was looking forward to trying the Biancolilla single estate oil from Oilo Taibi in Sicilly. It is really good - a wonderful flavor, delicate and full at the same time. I would have rated this a '5' were it not for the price, which I consider high. I never mix this for a vinaigrette (to me it would be like using a 15 year-old estate bottled rum for a rum & coke), but rather just use it with some freshly baked bread when enjoying a salad and some wine. Yummmm."
"Bought the discounted coupon via Groupon, to send it to HI.. at the time of groupon purchase, I couldn't find anything about not shipping to Hawaii.  But when ordering it via amazon, amazon didn't allow HI address. So had to ship it to my home first, and later gave it as a gift. Based on the recipient's comments, it tastes different, in a good way, than regular grocery oil."
Mild Salted Roasted Almonds. Good stuff from NOW foods. Almonds are kind of costly even higher than Cashew (halves and pieces from Planters) which is sad. But this NOW brand is one of the least pricey options in market now. Ty NOW
Pistachio's are one of my favorite nuts and I think these are a good value.  I've finished off 1 and a half of these 4 bags and the freshness has been very consistent so far.
"This is a very good light tea.  I recommend only using a cast iron tea pot when brewing.<br />I tried it with my plastic loose tea brewer, but it didn't taste right.  This specific brand<br />tasted as good as the tea in my favorite Asian restaurant and it is priced quite nicely.<br />Enjoy!! : )"
"The expensive Silver Needles White Tea comes from the Fujian region of China and has a very light and kind of grassy flavor.  If that's what you're looking for, this Tao of Tea product is not that.  According to the label it comes from the Hunan region of China and has a ""roasted chestnut and wild honey aroma"".  It costs less but the taste is definitely different.  If you've acquired a taste for the light/grassy flavor of Fujian White Tea, have a look at several other vendors that do carry that.<br /><br />If your drinking White tea mainly for health reasons, I don't know if one is any better than the other.  The flavor of this tea is nice and its organic so I'll continue to buy it, not as a replacement but as a supplement to the Fujian variety."
"The aroma of the brew is honey with a hint of pecan or chestnut. The flavor is nutty and mild, with a sweet honeysuckle aftertaste. Very smooth from start to finish. Though it takes a fair amount to steep, I normally infuse at least twice, so the cost ratio isn't unreasonable. I highly recommend."
"I cannot drink green tea, for some reason it doesn't agree with my stomach and that bummed me out because I like the health benefits. After reading up on White Tea, I decided to try this brand, and I am not disappointed! I like this tea and will stick with this brand for as long as I can get it! I like the taste, it goes down smooth! Just follow the directions and you will be fine! I also love that I will still get all of the health benefits and it's easy on my stomach! This one is a keeper!"
"This tea is an excellent product for the money. Delicious! You can also infuse this tea at least two times. The leaves were perfect. I will certainly purchase it again, in fact I joined up for the ""super saver"" deal which makes it well worth the price."
"I have found this product to be a good quality, organic tea that you can drink everyday without breaking the bank.  I like to vary the types of tea I drink throughout the day, so this one is just fine by my standards and enjoyable to drink."
"I had heard that white tea is the best in the world and the best for the body. This tea has a light delicate taste that doesn't taste like any other tea I've ever had. I liked it very much and would recommend it to any tea lover.  The only drawback was it's price, but the best never is cheap."
"Just as described in previous reviews - light, delicate and perfect for those who enjoy white tea without added flavors."
"light subtle taste. leaves are potent after multiple steepings. good amount for price, being an everyday drinker. would buy again."
"Both of my parents and my husband all drink this coffee, along with myself, and we all agree this coffee is really really good.  We are pretty picky about our coffee too.  Yeah we are coffee snobs.  The flavor is really bold and the tasters notes are to the T.  I would highly recommend this coffee.  I just wish it was in stock on Amazon more often :("
"I decided to try this product because my husband, never a picky taster,  stated he hated, hated, hated our usual decaf coffee.<br />Since I started preparing Jeremiah's Pick, he doesn't even realize he's drinking decaf. It actually tastes better than our usual caffeinated coffee. Ground for 15 seconds, it works very well in our stainless french press coffeepot."
This is a very good coffee esp for the price! It's a good alternative to the pricey Starbucks. It cups well with no bitterness
"I am a HUGE espresso drinker (stove top espresso pot); my love for deep, rich, dark espresso knows no bounds (I drink it straight, without milk or sugar).  Sadly, I was given stern orders to cut my caffeine in half by my doctor:(  What to do?!?  I have never found a good, enjoyable or even drinkable decaf bean that I could make espresso out of.  Jeremiah's Pick SAVED THE DAY!!!  This coffee is as rich, deep and dark as any roast for espresso I have ever come across. I opened my first bag, and the smell and shine to the beans let me know that I had found a truly different decaf. I cannot tell the difference between these beans and my caffeinated beans AT ALL, and I am finding myself indulging in a pot of decaf espresso in the afternoons now that the weather is turning cold, something I would never have allowed myself to do with caffeinated beans.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!  PLEASE DON""T STOP CARRYING THIS COFFEE!!!!"
"This coffee is so good that my husband who usually only drinks regular coffee (we brew two different small pots of coffee every morning) actually was looking for it. I served it to company last night and a diehard regular coffee drinker asked me for the name of the coffee I served when I said it was decaf. Best of all, they use the Swiss water process rather than the chemicals many other coffee companies use to make decaf. It's the best--try it."
"Wow. I don't usually write reviews, but these are some great beans at a reasonable price!<br />They truly live up to their description as ""round and robust"" and have become my favorite decaf. Put in a nice burr grinder and brew with 1:1 scoop/6oz cup water- they definitely hold their own. I'll be subscribing...<br /><br />Update:  2012-  wish I could still afford these beans, but they have nearly doubled in price over the past year or two... my second choice has been the Jeremiah's French Roast.  Solid, but not as complex."
"It's not bad coffee, but it certainly isn't my favorite.  I took a chance after reading the reviews, but I wasn't that impressed.  I grind my own coffee daily on (bordering) an espresso grind and run it through my keurig.  It has a clean taste, but not bold, deep and dark as I was expecting.  It actually has a light-medium body/taste.  I'm really choosy about my coffee though...  I like a smooth, buttery, heavy cup with strong hints of cocoa.  If you go to coffeereview.com, Jeremiah's pick wasn't rated among the highest.  My fave organic coffee that I have tried so far is Counter Culture.  It blows this one out of water!"
"I did not like this coffee.  I was excited to try it given all the great reviews.  However, it was either too weak or too strong and strange tasting.  I made two cups of coffee and had to put more than 3 tsps of grounds in to make it not weak.  However, when I did this the coffee had a strange taste.  I would not recommend this coffee."
"I love, love , love this coffee and it's truly decaf.  Since I'm very sensitive to caffeine and cannot consume even small amounts, I am so happy to have found Jeremiah's Pick Decaf.  It tastes great and I never get the jitters as I have with many other 'decaf' coffees. It's the best!"
"Great taste!!!  This is a decaf you can actually enjoy, just like any good cup of coffee.  I had to get it while pregnant and<br />I am seriously thinking to continue to use it in between my morning and afternoon regular cups to try and cut down on caffeine"
This stuff is the best!  Organic and Swiss water process along with delicious flavor.  Can't beat it unless they make it less expensive.
"I love coffee.  I have been a coffee fiend since I was about 13, and this is the YUMMIEST (to my taste) one so far.  I think... the decaf doesn't have as much yummy smell as regular (my roommate's cheap ground coffee smells way too good), but I love drinking coffee morning noon and night without jitters.  I subscribe to 90 ounces of Jeremiah's Pick per month (one person).  I'm ""addicted"" LOL."
I have a hard time finding good decaf beans locally... whether they are fair trade/organic or not.  Great cup of coffee!
This coffee is very good and it is organic which is better for you. I would tell all to try this coffee.
"The details on the packaging was ideal.  Everything I could have wanted. Unfortunately, the beans inside was not ideal.  To start with the whole beans were not whole.  They were in pieces and crumbling.  In addition the beans were of lower quality, because they were very small.  Eventhough we grind these beans to make our coffee, we want to start with a high quality whole bean that holds those flavors that we seek.  Unfortunately, 100% Arabica does not mean high quality arabica."
"It is important to know how your coffee is decaffeinated.  For example, one method is the direct method which uses methylene chloride in the process.  Methylene chloride is also used in paint strippers and degreasers.  This chemical was also banned by the FDA for use in  hairsprays and cosmetics, but is still in use for decaffeinating coffee...hmmm.  Now, I am not an expert on the decaffeination process or the justification for the chemicals continued use, but I encourage you to do your own research and decide accordingly!!  This coffee is not only organic but uses a Swiss water process to decafinate.  I use this coffee in my Rancilio espresso machine, and it makes an excellent cup of coffee.  We found that with most decaf coffees, it is harder to get nice crema.  With this stuff, the golden crema flows nicely:).  It has an excellent flavor, but if you are looking for a super strong dark roast, this may be a little light for you.  This is now our go to daily coffee."
"I've tried a lot of brands and always disliked the chemical taste most decaf has.<br />This is by far the best decaf coffee I've ever tasted.  No chemical taste, just fresh brewed coffee goodness.<br />Excellent coffee."
"I was disappointed with the taste of this coffee.  I don't use sugar in my coffee, only cream, and found the taste unpleasant without sugar. Unfortunately I bought a 3-pack.  I will only buy one pack of untried brands in the future.  I've been looking for a replacement for my preferred brand since it disappeared from the market.  Guess I'll keep looking."
"Jeremiah's Pick water-processed decaf whole bean dark roast is incredibly delicious,  No one ever guesses it's decaf. It's got a full rich flavor that I love. My only caveat is that the beans do not keep their  peak flavor for a full week (I usually go through most of a bag in a work week and go out for coffee on the weekends. Whatever beans are left in the bag on Friday are typically not as good the following Monday); they seem to get dry and lose some brewing strength as as result.  Still, for the exceptional full flavor--so rare in decaf coffees--a bit of loss is well worth it.<br />Just so we're comparing apples to apples: I use a Cuisinart Grind & Brew with thermal carafe, so my beans are ground directly before being brewed."
"The organic decaf raisin and chocolate is very good: not too bold for my taste, nor bitter either (I usually prefer a medium roast, and I do not like chicory in my coffee). If raisin and chocolate sounds improbable, it is; this is not a flavored coffee, just a coffee with a faint aroma."
"I was a little hesitant to purchase this coffee, as I am not into flavors- and raisin and chocolate was really raising the red flags for me! After reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot, as many people said you cannot taste the flavoring at all. And they were right! I made it for my mother's birthday last week, served everyone and told them it was regular coffee. Nobody had any idea it was decaf, and everyone complimented the taste. This coffee tastes like a rich but smooth dark roast - I've tried MANY decafs and they all taste like they're missing something (caffeine, perhaps??) and this coffee lacks nothing. It's absolutely perfect. It's rich and velvety -absolutely worth the purchase!"
"Honestly, this was the worst tasting coffee I've had in a while.  It had a bitter almost chemical aftertaste that I could not ignore.  It really tasted like it had been sitting under an engine exhaust somewhere,  SO AWFUL we dumped out every pot we brewed.  We normally drink Equal Exchange brand and I thought I would take my chances on this due to the reviews so I could have an evening coffee.  I still gave it two stars because I think any company that goes through the process of keeping their product organic, water processed and remotely fair trade deserves kudos.<br /><br />I think the main reason I didn't like it is because I normally like lighter roasts such as Columbian, and this is a dark roast.  The lighter the roast, the higher the caffeine content.  The darker, the lower the caffeine.  So both my husband and I have stayed with and have refined tastes for the lighter side of coffee when it comes to roasts.  I occassionally like dark roasts so I thought it might be a shoo-in.  Unfortunately, I got six bags of this with high hopes and since then I have been having to give it away to random people hoping they will like it.  Especially those I know that like darker roasts flavor.<br /><br />I am going to try either Equal Exchange's decaf or Jim's Organic ""Together"" decaf on vitacost next time.  So far, the only decaf I like is the Safeway brand 100% Columbian decaf but we have decided after much research on how coffee is processed that ORGANIC is the only way to go.  We grind our own coffee, use an aeropress, use raw local milk along with rapunzel sugar.  Best coffee in the world!  But this wasn't a good match for our system sadly."
"After going coffee-less for years due to an intolerance to caffeine and an aversion to conventional decaffeination methods, I decided to try this coffee. It's delicious! And it works great in a French press."
"I really like the full flavor of this coffee.  I get it auto-shipped to me once every 2 months, which is perfect, and I enjoy the service."
"It's very hard to find organic, decaf, AND Swiss Water Processed coffee on the market, but here's the one! I had no other option so I tried this coffee, but we've been having this ever since! This is the best decaf coffee ever we tried, and most of the time, nobody realize this is a decaf. Very strong, but not sour at all, perfect for dark coffee lover. I really can't tell if it has the flavor of raisin at all, but maybe hint of chocolate. Swiss Water Processed (SWP) coffee is any chemical trace free, cleanest coffee you can have. Frequent coffee drinker always should seek SWP."
"My order arrived within 2 days and I found the coffee to be very rich and robust for a decaf. I am picky and this coffee was the freshest decaf that rivals our local coffee house. I definitely will continue my reorders. A terrific value, pricewise, is the bonus. Don' t hesitate to purchase this from Amazon, you will be delighted. I always feel confident with Amazon."
"I'm pretty fussy about my coffee. This one is full, dark and as good as any caffeinated coffee. It should be the measure of all decafs."
Rich and robust.  The smell is great.  No one will ever know it's decaf.  I'll be ordering this again.
"Finally a decaf coffee that not only tastes like a good coffee house coffee, but is also water processed.<br /><br />We've been using this for almost a year now with the subscribe and save.<br /><br />I would say that it tastes closer to a french roast than a columbian."
This is the best decaf I have ever had. It is also only a notch under the best regular coffee I have ever tasted. Add that the price is less than most coffee beans and you have a great item here. I recommend it to every one who likes coffee.
"When Starbucks stopped selling their water-processed, bold flavored decaf many months ago, I needed to find a similar product I could enjoy on a regular basis. I'm rather particular about my coffee and I always grind beans at home for each cup. I found Jeremiah's Pick extra dark roast very much to my liking with its mild hints of caramel & chocolate. After ordering a couple of single bags and tinkering a bit with the measure of beans ground for each cup, I came to really enjoy it and began subscribing several months ago. Still love it for my regular big morning cup. While I recognize that coffee preferences are a highly individual matter, I would encourage all who are considering an organic, water-processed decaf to give it a try!"
"I received a 3 pack of this delightful coffee as a gift.  Lucky me!<br />I have such a hard time finding decaf with that dark roasted rich flavor that I miss.  That this is organic makes it an even nicer surprise, especially at the price!  Now I'm receiving it monthly!"
"Finally!!  A moderately priced whole bean decaf with exquisite taste and aroma.  I love my coffee but my husband can't have the caffeine.  I also like to switch to decaf after 2 cups of high test.  I am constantly disappointed, with the exception of Starbucks, with roasted decaf beans.  The coffee always tastes and smells (before and after brewing) burnt!!  I am already ordering more after my first taste with the delivery of three 10 oz bags.  I am going to give some of the regular brews a try as well!!"
I thought it impossible to find a decaf coffee that tastes as good as regular.  Then I tried Jeremiah's and discovered a whole new world of taste.  What makes it special is the water processing method.  No chemicals for me!  Love the taste of this aromatic coffee.
"This is the best decaf we have ever tasted. Pleased to have found this brand, will be ordering more. the small size sealed bags are perfect."
I had such high hopes for this coffee after reading the reviews but all I can say is...it was just AWFUL!  I would return it if I could.
This is DARK roast coffee.  I did not notice this before buying.  I do not like dark roast as the coffee seems burned and strong.  If you like Starbucks coffee then you will probably like this coffee.  I took one taste and dumped the entire pot out.  The smell is very strong which reminds me of a nasty cigar.
"When I decided to purchase a few gluten free snacks for my little one, who is allergic to wheat among other things, I was skeptical I could find anything that tasted any good.  These things are so good I have to force myself to share them with him.  I wish I could find them in bulk because they disappear too quickly.  Now if you are looking for something that tastes exactly the same as graham crackers you are out of luck here.  These are more like graham flavored shortbread cookies."
"I was expecting great things because of 1) price and 2) Omaha Steaks name.  This product did not live up to expectations.<br /><br />Chicken breast size is nice and cooks up well, but the artichoke parmesan oozes out during cooking and makes a mess.  Most all of the stuffing oozes out and leaves a bland (and horribly expensive) chicken breast.<br /><br />Omaha Steaks offers the Chicken Cordon Bleu which is better for both the tastebuds and wallet."
"I've bought Millstone from several grocery stores for several years, and it's always been pretty good.  I ordered two packages from Amazon and both tasted absolutely awful.  No wonder...the ""best by"" date on both packages of coffee was dated two months prior to my order.<br /><br />I'll still buy dry goods and true unperishable items from Amazon Grocery, but I'll skip things like coffee, nuts and other foods that go bad or degrade in quality after significant storage time."
"Millstone Breafast Blend coffee is the mildest of all the coffees I have tried. I also like high caffeine coffee. Remember: Light roast = high caffeine. Most people think the opposite.<br /><br />Anyway, I like this, and the price is very reasonable. Note: It is NOT for people who like the taste of dark roast coffee."
"I discovered this brand of coffee when I was attempting to find less expensive ways to use my Keurig brewer (which I no longer have).  The breakfast blend is my favorite.  Both our major grocery chain and Wal-Mart carried it.  The coffee is just exactly what I enjoy.  It is mellow and not too acidic.  I don't like to drink coffee that has been sitting for more than 30 minutes, since almost all of them turn bitter and burned tasting.  Unfortunately, the Millstone coffees became hard to find, so, as always, I turned to Amazon for help.  I now have a monthly subscription service for the coffee.  The price is fantastic and the convenience of getting a monthly supply in the mail is great.  Millstone makes a number of different blends, so if mild and mellow is not your style, they probably have one that is.  ""Try it - you'll like it."""
"I have a hiatal hernia and acid reflux so it is important that I drink only a low acid coffee.  Most of the time with these problems you are not supposed to drink coffee, but I find that I can have one 12 oz. cup of Millstone Breakfast Blend in the morning without problems.<br /><br />I have used Millstone for years.  I try other brands from time to time but alway come back to Millstone.  Very smooth, very tasty.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
"I don't like strong, bitter coffee. I've been purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ546Y"">Starbucks Breakfast Blend Coffee (Mild), Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> & <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ53TW"">Starbucks Half Caffeinated Breakfast Blend Coffee (Mild), Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> for a few years. I've tried and enjoyed a few Millstone flavors too, but for some reason I never tried their Breakfast Blend. I'm tired of flavored coffee so I picked up the Breakfast Blend at the grocery store.  I've been alternating between Millstone Breakfast Blend (it's aromatic and mild) & Starbuck Breakfast Blend. Usually I'll buy the least expensive of the two. The current subscribe and save price of $15.06 on the Millstone Breakfast Blend is a great price, & I couldn't find this on the store shelf last week...so I'm ordering from Amazon & saving over $2 a package too.  I can't wait for my first shipment to arrive."
"Millstone Breakfast Blend is by  far the best Coffee we ever brewed in our house. I found it first in Zanesville OH<br />unfortunately I have not been able to find it in NJ , so Amazon is my best source to purchase it .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GZI"">Millstone Breakfast Blend Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>"
"after trying most brands of coffee, I have settled on Millstone Breakfast Blend..  It is consistently full bodied and enjoyable as well as being very reasonably priced."
"I love this coffee!  I have never gotten a stale shipment from Amazon and if it should happen, I know that Amazon would take care of the problem.  If you like a mild light roast coffee then Breakfast Blend is the best.  I have also ordered the Kona coffee and it is good also.  The order always comes in fast and I store the extra package in the freezer until I am ready to open it.  Always stays fresh that way."
This is one of my favorite coffees and yes I have tried many many brands. Starbucks is too strong for my liking but this one really is smooth and not bitter at all. A great morning coffee!!
"My husband and I think this the best tasting coffee for coffeemakers at home.Buying from you is much easier.Sometimes,the stores are out of this brand and then we are stuck buying other brands.I think we have tried them all! The flavor is just right.Customer service is great and the shipping is fast.We love the fact that we can order the coffee from you and never running out.After tasting this coffee we don't want any other brand."
"A friend of mine in Texas told me there were very good.  She was right!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K3S4FG"">Hershey's Milk Chocolate Drops 8oz</a>"
"Taste is not as good as other Halva Products I have purchased in the past, I will have to try other brands."
"The taste is good, it is shelf stable and it does not separate, but the name is somewhat misleading.<br />Most natural peanut butters contain one ingredient- peanuts. Some brands also add a touch of salt as a flavor enhancer. This product contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt. The palm oil is where I am disappointed. Skippy removes a portion of the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. The peanut oil can be sold for a substantial profit, so it is removed during processing and replaced with very inexpensive palm oil."
"I wrote a similar review for the creamy, but thought I would add one to the crunchy version. This PB rocks! Great taste and no hydrogenated oils. Doesn't separate! Much better than the natural stuff that's out there. My kids love it (while they hated the other natural stuff)."
"The first reviewer wrote:  ""The flavor of this product is good. But peanut butter always tastes good. Skippy doesn't deserve credit for the fact that peanut butter tastes good.""<br /><br />She missed the whole point. This isn't just any peanut butter. Skippy has managed to produce a PB with no hydrogenated oils, while having no separation -- and it still tastes great. Try any other brand with no hydrogenated oils and you'll find that they actually don't taste very good, they have all the oil on top, and you have to keep them in the refrigerator. This Skippy product is a very unique peanut butter.<br /><br />She admits it tastes good, yet instead of rating it highly, she only gave it one star because it's kosher. C'mon! Amazon should remove the review."
"This Peanut butter is REALLY good.  If you've been eating the high sugar PB's, it may take a minute to readjust your tongue.  But, frankly, a PB that I don't have to stir!?!  ROCK ON!  Now for the Kosher thing, being Kosher is more than just ""paying a Rabbi to bless the food.""  There are rules for how it is prepared (check out [...] for details).  So, get over that and accept that Skippy took some extra steps, which, in the grand scheme of things, does not drive up the price of a jar of peanut butter!"
This is definitly chunky PB and what you expect from Skippy. It is natural so no HFCS but stii has oil and sugar added.
"So my local grocers, Jewel an Dominick's, decided no one likes crunchy peanut butter or atleast natural crunchy, so they decided for me which brand I would buy and only stocked one brand in each store. Both brands are bland and pretty gross, unlike the Skippy Natural Super Chunk, which tastes pretty close to regular chunchy peanut butter. To make it even better I get it cheaper from Amazon delivered then going to the store to get their choices or skippy when they had it."
"This peanut butter is great for the price. We eat a lot of natural peanut butter so when I saw this brand offered here on Amazon I decided to order us some. It taste really good. You don't need to stir it like other natural peanut butters either. However, it does not come in a nice glass jar...you get a plastic one instead. Personally, I do like the crunchy brand a little more than the smooth type because we use it for various African/Southeast Asian recipes (peanut butter soup/peanut butter sauce) in our house and the texture works wonderfully."
"This peanut butter contains added sugar, which is not what I'm looking for in a ""natural"" peanut butter.  Additionally, they remove some of the peanut oil and replace it with palm oil, which is cheaper and environmentally suspect in its harvesting.  I understand that these are all products that are of a nature-based origin, but adding ingredients to something that is already quite natural (blend your peanuts - you've got peanut butter!) makes it not natural in my eyes."
"You can get these at your grocery store for the same price, if not cheaper. I didn't realize they were only 15oz jars. If it was clearly laid out when I ordered it, then I most likely would not have bought it! And from the reviews, it seems it's not so natural after all..."
"Yes..., the draw back is PALM oil, its advantage is it reduce the quickness of separation.  This brand does not have to be stored in a refrigerator to reduce separation.  I live in an apartment that averages about 80 deg. F. and I don't have to store this in a refrigerator.<br /><br />I used to be a ROUNDY'S natural peanut butter fan, but got sick of mixing peanut butter and the separated oil.<br /><br />AS far as ingredients go... peanuts, sugar, palm oil, salt.<br />There isn't a brand on the planet that doesn't have salt added to it, even organic..(that I have seen, incl. Trader Joe's)<br />I do wish they didn't add the sugars, but maybe it is in the future for other non-mixing peanut butter brands<br /><br />Sugars in this brand is 3g per 2TBSP(32g) compared to the 16g/TBSP found in other brands, it's really good.<br />Compared to some(very few) with no added sugar, its comparable/reasonable at least...<br /><br />Cal: 190/Cal.f.F 140<br />Sodium: 150mg/TBSP<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Total fat: 16g/3.5sat/0 trans<br />Protein: 7g<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Iron,4%.Niacin,20%.Vitamin E,10%.<br />Calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C: 0%<br /><br />I hated mixing peanut butter that was truly organic, and this is as close as I've found.  I am not an ""ORGANIC"" freak, as some are... if you want organic peanut butter this is not it.  If you want cheap/volume natural/ish peanut butter this is as close as you're going to get.<br /><br />Taste is great, I have eaten a jar of this peanut butter with no bread, over a week or two, but nun<br />-the-less,<br /> I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER!!<br />and for MY LOVE,<br />and my need for it to be filled, economically,<br />This is it!!!<br /><br />Benjamin<br /><br />P.S.<br />If I had a better budget and craved peanut butter less, I would go with something more ""TOP QUALITY""..<br />but my grocer offers this 26.5oz jar of PB for $3.29, so I'm hooked.<br />...26.5oz. lasts me a week or sometimes less...<br />I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER!!<br />good luck."
"I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its taste and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Super Chunk:<br /><br />""Raters  loved the ultra-smooth butter portion and the pleasantly salty flavor. Besides the abundance of nuts, the peanut aroma and appealing caramel color won us over..Good for baking, ice cream, dessert sauces, satay sauce, or to thicken a winter vegetable stew.""<br /><br />This is my opinion, too. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.  While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />One caveat so far as Super Chunk, though. If you have soft teeth, best to stick with creamy. Otherwise you're taking chances with possible tooth or gum problems because of the bits of nut, which can be very crunchy.<br /><br />While I have often bought the reduced fat versions in the past, some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of this approach. They have two basic points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue."
"Believe me, I've tried all of the major brands, and a good number of the smaller ones, too.<br /><br />Skippy Natural Super Chunk is, to me, simply the best in terms of taste, texture, health, and value.<br /><br />The only way it could feasibly be better is if Subscribe & Save was re-instituted! (and the prices went back close to what they were just a couple months ago)"
"I usually prefer creamy peanut butter, but this chunky is a nice change from time to time.  It's loaded with little chunks of peanuts.  Great flavor, and all natural.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No hydrogenated oils added.<br />- No need to stir, even if you haven't used it for awhile.  A small amount of oil will pool, but I don't find any need to really stir it.<br />- Chunks of peanuts are small and plentiful.<br />- Slightly sweet, slightly salty taste and a very fresh peanut flavor.<br />- Spreads well on toast, bread, or whatever.<br />- Can bake with it just fine.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None!<br /><br />I recommend switching to a natural peanut butter.  Peanut butter can be a great source of protein, but if it's not natural, it's filled with stuff you don't want or need.  This stuff has a great flavor and a smooth texture with crunchy peanuts."
"My family loves this peanut butter, but I can purchase it cheaper at Walmart than on Amazon. At first this was not the case, but the price has continued to climb on here so I must choose the cheaper route."
"I've always loved crunchy peanut butter, and of the types that I've tried I like this one the best. :) I'm not terribly educated on what makes this more ""natural"" than others, or whether it really is that good for you, but it does provide a protein punch and tastes amazing. Even my girlfriend, who swore she'd only eat Peter Pan classic creamy, eventually gave in and agrees that this stuff is the best of the best.<br /><br />Here in Manhattan, it's also something like $3.99-$4.49 a jar; with this deal it comes out to something like $3.21 a jar, and we go through it pretty fast. :)"
Very tasty and arrives in great shape and as promised.  Recommended for those who like a natural peanut butter but don't want to mess with mixing; requires no stirring.  Better than other brands I've tried.  Super Chunk is hard to find in stores.
This peanut butter is so crunchy.  It is very good in peanut butter fudge or other recipes that use peanut butter.
I got a great price on this! I would definitely buy it from Amazon again especially if I got a great deal like this one!!!
"I was hesitant to buy, as last time I tried a natural peanut butter the taste was just not worth getting used to. After reading the reviews I thought I would have the same experience. Not at all, tastes like any other peanut butter I've liked without all the oils. This stuff is good and good for you!"
"The best, simply said.  We enjoy this peanut butter and go through tons of it.  I like that it doesnt have extra ingredients in it and the family loves the taste.  Perfect!"
"I absolutely love the Skippy natural peanut butter. It is every bit as delicious and the same yummy peanut butter we love, but I love seeing the few simple ingredients in the jar. Nothing that I can't read! :) My hubby love Super-Chunk, I love Creamy. We both love the Natural addition to Skippy's product line."
"I never grew out of eating peanut butter nearly all the time as a kid and now I've got no reason to. Between the lack of high fructose corn syrup and a list of ingredients I can pronounce and about which I know a thing or two, I'm quite pleased. Unlike most natural peanut butters, this sits on my shelf without separating much more than typical peanut butter and the texture is superb, not grainy and dry."
"I love this peanut butter and I use it for all my peanut butter needs. In our family 3 prefer chunky, 3 prefer smooth. The chunky fans have gone through 7 jars (this is our second order). Skippy is the best!!!"
"I love this peanut butter!  The taste is smooth, creamy and never dry.  I am never without a jar in my home  It is very healthy without bad oils or trans fats.  I eat it almost daily!"
"I got this to satisfy my needs for frequent peanut butter. I am usually a creamy peanut butter eater, but the price of this was just too good to pass up so I took a chance.  I've been enjoying this type and I am glad I have it a chance. It seems a bit more dry than creamy, but still quite good. Once I finish with these six bottles I will likely go back to my love of creamy... but I am happy for my experience and rate this item highly.  Bottles (plastic) were sent well protected, were clean, new, and properly packaged.  I recommend it."
"hard to find this peanut butter in stores, so glad to see it here for a decent price, thanks amazon"
"Peanut Butter. On a cracker, on celery, on a slew of different things.  What's not to like! Skippy, name brand, great buy."
"Dennis the Menace, Annette Funicello and Bonnie Blair are right! Skippy Peanut Butter is the best. It has a good nutty flavor and tastes like real roasted peanuts. The Natural Super Chunk is just like the ad says - No Hydrogenated Oil, No Need to Stir, No Preservatives, Colors or Artificial Flavors. It is a good source of Vitamin E which many of us need. According to wiki all Skippy peanut butter is produced in North American plants."
"I love to eat Peanut butter! I eat it on sandwichs, with apples, with ice cream, you name it, and this is some really, really  tasty peanut butter."
This healthy and natural product is a staple in our home.  Amazon offers great ways to stay stocked up at reasonable prices... on this product
"I bought this for the low sugar content and reviews that talk about good taste. I understood it has some saturated fat (palm oil) and no trans fat, ok with me. It does taste very good but I did a comparison with Walmart's ""Great Value"" peanut butter and found some surprises. Wally's has the same sugar content, also has zero trans fat, is slightly lower in calories, is lower in calories from fat and lower in sodium. Tastes very good, sells for a lot less. I'm no nutritionist so I would welcome any reviewer who can tell mw what I'm missing and why I shouldn't go with Wally."
"I agree w/another reviewer who said that this peanut butter bridges the gap between Jif-type PB's & the kind you have to stir.  While I personally prefer organic raw almond butter, my husband pretty much hates anything labeled ""natural,"" ""organic,"" etc.  This is a great compromise.  Yes, it contains sugar (only 3g), & yes it contains palm oil, but it does NOT contain preservatives or trans fats!  Plus, Subscribe & Save cuts the price per jar to $2.65!"
Very good!!  Enjoyed right out of the jar.  Spread very easily onto the bread. Like the larger chunks.  Very consist jar to jar.  No need to stir.
"I've tried to eat the 100% all natural peanut butter, many diff brands, found only 1 I liked, but then came across this one. Although its not 100% all natural, like most products like that only contain peanuts and maybe salt, this one too me still has few ingredients and no hydrogenated oils.  I don't know how people like the ""just peanut"" peanut butter, but to each is their own.  I'm huge into organics and all-natural, but just can't like the just peanut taste in peanut butter. I've gone through many jars within the passed 6 months.  The only 100% all natural peanut butter I liked was called Richards, not sure if Amazon sells it, but try that if you like just peanuts as your ingredients. Good luck!"
"Happy I got in on the proverbial party before prices skyrocketed (despite them using a very small ratio of peanuts to filler). Overly sweet, not very peanutty, and certainly not something I'd grab for more than $2/jar."
"If you are anticipating peanuts, salt and nothing else, this is not for you.  Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however.  If you are mixing true ""natural"" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too)."
"I hate it when manufacturers chose to use misleading terms and try making the product more desirable than it actually is.<br />Yes, Natural it is, but not really when its got added 'natural' unneeded crap. Can't stand when some live-and-eat-by-manufacturer americans who couldn't care less or are ignorant upvote an unhealthy product. Unhealthy only because they add unneeded sugar and palm oil..heck they could have just added HFCS and these same reviewers would have given them 5 stars still ! Wake up America !! Get off the coke !! ""NATURAL"" my &&&"
"To me ""natural peanut butter"" means it has nothing but peanuts in it. That is the way we get them from the ground.This is Skippy trash and lie. This product is not natural! It has added ingredients. They add Palm oil which is a saturated fat and is not healthy for you. They also add sugar and salt. ???always found in Natural peanuts............NOT!!! Don't buy this crap. Amazon should not sell this as natural. Now I don't trust Amazon any longer!"
"if you read the label closely , you'll see that this is peanut butter spread . . . .<br /><br />so they can adulterate it with what ever they want . . . .<br /><br />natural - ly"
I love my new M&M dispenser.  I can't believe I even found it.  It's certainly a collector's item and will forever stay in a box on display.  The service I received from the seller was great - quick and easy.  I will purchase from this seller again.
"This item was shown in the box, I recieved it with no box, for the price and being a collectors item I'm not happy at all with being ripped off!!!! This was a faulse advertised item."
"""This item was shown in the box, I recieved it with no box, for the price and being a collectors item I'm not happy at all with being ripped off!!!! This was a faulse advertised item."""
I really like that there are different roasts of coffee in the pack. It is tough enough to be restricted to decaf coffee. This way I can at least choose my coffee strength. I would order this item again.
I cooked chicken adobo the other day and use this mix and my wife had a diarrhea. And today I cook pork adobo and use this mix and gave me a diarrhea. I will return those three extra pouch I bought. The taste was good but not worth it to have a diarrhea.
"In the description for Sucralite the concentrations stated is 1 drop is equal to 1 teaspoonful sugar.  However, the bottle says 3 drops = 2 teaspoonfuls, which would be 33% less concentrated.  I contacted the company and they stated that the online description IS accurate but that the labeling on the bottle is wrong.  My unscientific taste test, compared to EZ-Sweet, suggests that they are honest as the sweetness does seem equal to EZ-Sweet, i.e. 1 drop = 1tsp.<br /><br />More importantly, this bottle design is NOT ideal for delivering drops. I just addidentally put a bunch into a cup of coffee, ruining it.<br /><br />Just ruined some more coffee."
"This has a nice flavor for just about everything and the ""heat"" is  not overwhelming - although I have been known to add a little cayenne depending on the dish.  Try tossing this with some EVO on some sliced (like fries) yams, sweet or red potatoes, cook in the oven at 375 for about 40-50 minutes - serve with aioli. I bought this once years ago and have not been able to find this large affordable size since.  After several attempts to recreate or come up with a better alternative on my own (the ingredients are listed except the critical one ""spices"" is not defined!) I conceded and ordered more.  Well worth it!"
"If anyone has ever had the fries from the fairly famous restaurant chain ""***** Guys,"" then you know what I mean when I say their Cajun Fries are spectacular.  I bought the McKormicks Cajun Bayou brand seasoning to try to make my own fries.<br /><br />The shipping was amazingly fast, I got it before even the estimated delivery date.<br />The seasoning tastes great.  It's not quite like ""the Guys"" but I'm getting closer.  I know they fry in peanut oil so I am going to try that next.  I have also heard they double fry their fries.  I am going to try to figure out how to do that.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent product and seller."
"...and I found out my cat does too. The quality is amazing. As you can see from my photo, it contains whole baby mussel meat. I would've given it 5 stars, but deducted a star because it looks gross, and my cat spits out the mussels."
All six of my cats absolutely LOVE this food.  All fussie cat foods are devoured by even my pickiest eaters.
"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson.  After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam.  When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made.  This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam...""<br /><br />This stuff is great!  It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar.  It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on.  Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato.  This will be a regular item in my house.  I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread."
"Note: I'm discussing the packaging and shipping issues here because I was not able to do so via Amazon's special feedback section for packaging and shipping and there is no way to contact Deals on Call LLC that I can find, but I wanted them to be aware of this. It is also relevant as it affects the product you may purchase for yourself or others--especially if you're having it shipped as a gift to others. I'm taking the time to write this to give you information you may want and to save you time.<br /><br />Had researched this product online as I had seen it mentioned (with praise) on several TV shows, as a gift for my many bacon-loving friends. Was a bit concerned about whether or not it required special packaging (cooling, etc.) during shipping after reading some comments here on amazon and elsewhere. (My personal experience with items that require any sort of special cooling, etc. is that stuff arrives in unusable state. This is often the fault of the carrier, FedEx, UPS, etc. rather than the manufacturer or shipper.)<br /><br />Called the company in Seattle (Skillet Street Food) and asked whether the product required cooling/refrigerating during shipment. Answer: No. (Information was not on website. Had also sent an email suggesting they add that information AND the nutritional content on their Web site. When it comes to food products, you can NEVER have too much information. I was surprised that I had not found it in the info about the product in the Amazon listing either.)<br /><br />I then ordered the three pack (cheapest option price wise). Paid for next-day delivery and it arrived in less than 24 hours. Excellent.<br /><br />Opened the smallish box. Now given the size of the three jars and the box, there was not enough of those packing pillows to hold it in place and it was clear that the three jars (placed inside a simple plastic bag and not fixed in place via any method) had moved around during shipping. Plastic jars not damaged, but they easily could have been from hitting each other during handling, etc.<br /><br />The first thing I wanted to check was the seals as my research said that if the seal is broken, the product has been compromised and you cannot eat it (See info to come from the company.) Well, the lid on one of the jars was open and loose, there was some greasy film around the rim of the jar...and when I opened it, half of the seal was open and the jam was coming out.<br /><br />Now, this is actually good news. It alerted me that the jar had been compromised and I immediately tossed it. (The seals on the other two jars were fine; no film; lids secure.)<br /><br />Called Amazon customer service and explained what happened; it was unclear to me who had handled, packed and shipped the actual order--amazon or Deals On Call LLc. Still not sure. I requested a replacement jar, which they could not do, but they did refund me the entire amount so I could reorder another three jars, which I will do.<br /><br />It is still unclear WHEN the seal came open and what caused it. Because of what I do in my ""real"" life, I'm a stickler about health and safety issues. Since it was unclear as to who did the actual handling, packing and shipping of the bacon jam jars for this order, and I could not contact the vendor (Deals On Call LLC) directly to relay the problem about what may have happened in shipping, I did ask Amazon to do so. And I'm sharing it here.<br /><br />But I went a step further because this is the product of a small-biz in Seattle and having seen the web site for the company, where they actively solicit feedback, I thought it made sense to alert them to this issue so they could possibly alert the folks who buy from them to be aware that seals could come open after the product left Skillet Street Foods and was handled elsewhere (retail, etc.).<br /><br />When I reached them (no annoying voicemail but an actual person responsible for the product who was professional and courteous), the person explained how units are checked individually to ensure seals are secure, before they are lidded and sent on their way. He also knew the vendor associated with this Amazon purchase, and could vouch for their reliable and professional service (which I assumed given their high ratings on amazon). More importantly, he said he would discuss the packaging issues<br /><br />Net-net: Seals can open, but this is apparently rare. You should be alert. If the seal is open, air has gotten into the jar and the jam should NOT be eaten. (This could explain why some folks have had an issue with the taste while others are raving about the jam.)<br /><br />>>Jars are shelf-stable until open. Once open, they must be refrigerated. There is a use by date on the bottom of each jar. You can freeze the jam if not opened and used by that date (good to know).<br /><br />Again, this information is not on the Skillet Street Web site that I could find (as of this writing) and not here on amazon posting. It should be added. Along with the nutritional information and ingredients.<br /><br />This is what is on the jar itself:<br /><br />""Store it in the fridge, serve it at room temp and use or freeze by date printed on bottom of container.""<br /><br />FYI: Just reading that wording, it's unclear whether ""store it in the fridge"" applies to when you receive it. Or after you open it.<br /><br />Perhaps the wording should be revised so it says. ""Refrigerate after opening."" As so many labels do, to differentiate from those that require no special handling or those that say ""Keep refrigerated.""<br /><br />One should never assume that it's clear. Example: We buy pickles in a jar. They are shelf stable. Until we ordered a new kind. Imagine our surprise, when opening several days later, they were off. Our bad because we had NOT read the packaging which said: Keep refrigerated.

However, once my recipients report back, I will add this feedback.<br /><br />Very impressed by Skillet Street Foods as the creater/manufacturer of the jam who appears genuinely interested in improving all aspects of product and delivery, and, as always, very pleased that Amazon could deal with the problem quickly and easily.<br /><br />Would have been happy with just a replacement jar but Amazon went the extra mile.<br /><br />Hope that the nutritional information and ingredients and the details about usage will be added to the Skillet Street Food online shop and to any listing/posting where this product is sold.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised that this information is not readily available. A few friends told me that they will never order any food product without first seeing this information. Which means everyone is losing sales when a product like this is offered without the details. Plus, lots of folks might miss out on what many say is an incredibly tasty and versatile jam!"
"This ""Bacon Spread"" is every bit as delicious as it sounds! This has a jam consistency that lends itself to spreading on hamburger buns (which is very good, indeed) but it also makes a great addition to anything that pairs well with bacon. We added this to our homemade fried rice and it was nothing short of amazing!<br /><br />While this is a little pricy, it makes a great gift for the ""gourmet chef"" in your life!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
"This stuff is so good, I first tried it in Portland, OR, at a Bacon fest. I've been ordering it since I got back to Boston, I'm out now and will be ordering more immediately."
"I liked the idea of adding smoked bacon flavor to food, so I decided to try this concoction.  It does contain smoked bacon (pork, water, salt sugar, nitrites and smoke), onion, balsamic binegar and brown sugar (sugar, invert sugar, cane molasses) saalt, black pepper.<br /><br />While it does impart a smoked bacon flavor to foods (scrambled eggs I tried, for example) I found the jam way too sweet for my taste...read the ingredients again to see how much sugar is added.  When I think of smoked bacon I think of bacon flavor predominating, with a moderate dose of smoke, and definitely salty, not with sweet overtones.<br /><br />Note that the shelf life of the 3 jars that I bought is only 2 months.....directions say to use or freeze.  And you need to refrigerate the product while it is being consumed.<br /><br />So if you like sweet smoky bacon flavor go for it, but I prefer a saltier version."
"Received the 3 pack of bacon goodness and one of the jars had a decent sized hole in it.  Bacon jam was inside the bag that the three jars were shipped in.  Probably would have been a good idea to ship the three jars with some kind of protection in between each jar.  Just putting them in a bag doesn't sound like safe travel.<br /><br />Regardless, I immediately contacted the seller and they sent an email back with in 10 minutes saying they would be glad to send out a new jar.  They didn't request that I send back the damaged one and didn't even ask for a photo of the damage.  Just took my word.  Pretty cool!<br /><br />With in 5 minutes of that email, I received another email saying that a replacement package had been shipped.  Now that's service!  Great job!  I wish all sellers were like that.  I may stop purchasing food products online.  Damage like this has happend before and many sellers don't offer returns.<br /><br />Other than that, the bacon spread is great!  What's not to love about anything BACON?!"
"I got this on Woot, Amazon's sister site. They were a lot less for three different varieties...or two. Next time it comes up on Woot, I'm there. Now I might put it in eggs or on grilled cheese or even on the occasional hamburger. It is really just so rich and spicy and yum. I ate it in little spoonfuls at a time till it was all gone. Wrong, I know, but as a mostly low carb eater, I had to atone for the carbs in the jam by not eating it on starch. The eggs idea is brilliant, though...seems silly not to have thought of it."
"I expected this to have a rich, smoky bacon taste with a slight sweetness from the brown sugar. Instead it has a bland sweetness and almost no bacon taste. I have seldom been so disappointed in a food product.<br /><br />I gave a jar of the bacon jam to my mother before I tried it. We both tried it for breakfast the next day at our respective houses. She independently came to the same opinion of it as I have.<br /><br />At over $22 a pound, it's also a pricey disappointment."
"We saw this product on Foodtv and my wife bought it for me for my birthday.  This is food of the gods.  I tried it initially on burgers and then on steak and then chicken and now I try something new with it every month.  You should not eat this cold but, placed on top of something warm, you will could make even my mom's horrible cooking taste good.  It seems risky but the 3 jar package is a better deal and you will not regret it!  Mmmmm bacon!"
"This stuff is amazing.  I am getting more for myself and to give as gifts.  You can put it in salad, on crackers or eat it right out of the jar.  Yummy Yummy"
"At the time of ordering, description did not mention refrigeration necessary.  I'd thought this was a glass ""canned"" jar of jam, similar to fruit jams that do not need refrigeration until opened.  It arrived fine, but I didn't open right away.  The freezer-pack in box gave away the issue.  The box was not labeled perishable.  I would NOT order this online again."
"This will be stocked in my pantry from now on.  Very versatile. Could use a bit more of the onion, but-my-oh-my!!!!  This is a home run."
"Great gift for the bacon lover in your life. It may seem like an odd product, but it pairs beautifully with a blue cheese hamburger. A little goes along way."
"Toast 1/2 English muffin, smear with bacon jam <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4"">Skillet Bacon Jam Bacon Spread 7 0z. - 3 Jar Pack</a>, cover with a thick slice of heirloom tomato in season, salt & pepper to taste.  A quick, mouth-wateringly delicious breakfast!  (After the tomato season, I plan to experiment with lightly grilled supermarket tomatoes but haven't tried this yet.)"
"I love this jam with grilled cheese!  Very tasty!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4"">Skillet Bacon Jam Bacon Spread 7 0z. - 3 Jar Pack</a>"
"Company offered great service, but product just doesn't seem as good as the original Bacon Jam; It is a thinner jam with less chunky ingredients."
"This spread is perfect to add to scrambled eggs, deviled eggs, potato salad and or just about anything where you want to quickly add a good bacon flavor."
Bacon jam is the best product since Peanut Butter!!!  A thin spread of this jam on the bread as you make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich will make you wonder why you never thought of this before and you won't want your sandwich any other way from now on.  This is real bacon cooked and chopped up for you.  Quick and easy way to get your bacon and so much cleaner than cooking it yourself.  A MUST TRY.  I made believers of my entire family with this
"It is a little spendy (okay, a lot spendy), but perfect for a special gift.  The Bacon lovers in our family can't get enough of it. They spread a little on toast and a fried egg and they are good to go for breakfast."
"Do you want a different salad?  Grill romaine lettuce leaves, heat some Bacon Jam and voila! a very different and satisfying salad<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4"">Skillet Bacon Jam Bacon Spread 7 0z. - 3 Jar Pack</a>"
"Delicious, delicious, delicious. Turns a hamburger into a gourmet meal. Great spread to put on any sandwich to give it a sweet bacon flavor without overpowering the rest of the ingredients. It would have been much better if it would have been Prime eligible.  Oh, don't forget to refrigerate it when it's delivered."
This stuff is tasty. Egg sandwhich with this as a spread. Scallops seared and topped with bacon spread and pasta. Going for the burger topper next.
Sounds strange when you hear it but it is Fabulous.  If you ever had a wilted spinach salad the dressing tastes much like this.  Bacony with just enough sweet and tartness from vinegar to really give it a zip.  I just got mine and will be careful not to run out in the near future.
"I saw this product & was almost immediately sold... But it didn't quite meet my imagined expectations. It was a weird consistency & doesn't actually taste all that much like bacon, funnily enough. I wouldn't recommend you taking a chance on this."
"What I received did not taste good at all. I saw this on the food network with high hopes as I love everything pork and bacon is at the top of the list. I was shocked that I did not like it. It had a very funny aftertaste that reminds me of bacon drippings that have been saved in a can and not refrigerated. One other reviewer said they received theirs in a cold pack. Mine did not come that way, it came in a regular box with paper around it but no cold packs. Maybe the 3 jars I received had gone bad but I have no way of knowing. What I received and tasted could not be what all these other 5 star reviewers receieved. I may order another batch later on after the sting of this purchase is gone and will update this review if it is different then what I received this time. All I can say is beware that it appears it might go bad very easily."
"Not quite what I expected. This product may be appreciated by some but it was not by me. It does not make your hot dog taste like a bacon dog. It does not make your omelette taste like a bacon omelette, it does not make your hamburger taste like a bacon burger or a sandwich like a sandwich with bacon."
"For those who are tempted to spend the $14 or so (per 7 oz jar) of this stuff, let me save you the money.<br /><br />We bought a jar at Costco (same $$)  because it just sounded soooooo yummy.  And it IS tasty, but we don't think it worth the price.<br /><br />Basically, it seems like you can make your own by frying some diced real bacon to a medium crisp --keep the melted fat.  Then make a batch of caramelized onions (see the first part of Julia Child's French Onion Soup recipe)  and add a spoon or two of brown sugar.  Throw it all (fat, too) in a blender, add a splash of Balsamic vinegar, blend to a paste.  That pretty much approximates the flavor of this product.  You can doctor it as you like.<br /><br />When we finish this jar, that'll be it.  I'd rather spend the $$ on Umami Paste or something.<br /><br />The cleaned, empty jar is a good size/shape for leftover paint. (Waste not. . .)"
"All three jars were received with seals breached.  As they were unsealed, there was grease everywhere in the packaging.  Very, very disappointed.  Got my money back, threw em out and will never order again."
"When I opened the box there were three jars in side a plastic bag, sticky stuff all over, on closer inspection one jar had been cracked, the box had two air pillow on each side of box nothing on bottom or top,I think who ever packed it was lazy,and for the bacon jam, not so good. This is my first purchase from Amazon not happy.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4"">Skillet Bacon Jam Bacon Spread 7 0z. - 3 Jar Pack</a>"
"This tuna in EVOO is a real treat - you'll have no problem eating it right out of the can! Keep a can in your desk at work with some saltines for a satisfying, fast lunch. Another thing, no one in the office will object to the SMELL because there ISN'T any! (Even the empty tin in the trash does not smell.) The tuna is juicy and delicious, better than any you've ever had.

"Unless you're a health nut, tuna in olive oil is almost always preferable to that in water. And Genova is the best of the normally priced ones. (there are some super-expensive imported brands in a jar, but they cost as much as fresh tuna) For a quick meal, I like to open a can over a salad mix, complete with the oil, then add some fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper and that's it! A quick, delicious healthy meal."
"i have been enjoying genova tuna for more than 40 years! as stores cut back on stock they have chosen to eliminate the small can ( perfect for lunch )of this tuna and only sell the large one.in searching for the small can i found it at a great price and available in a 24 count box at amazon.com .the service was fast and the shipping rate was hard to beat. without a doubt i will be purchasing another case of this great tuna ,from amazon .com"
"This really is the best tuna on the market, hard to find tuna like this in stores and really hard to find tuna in olive oil.  Great for sandwiches and salads but really hard to beat the quality and comparing to the specialty store in my area that sells at twice the price this is a value.  Much better than the Progresso brand we bought a few months ago, just more consistent."
"I bought this product three times. The first two times I got the ""made in Italy"" version, and it was among the best canned tuna I had ever had (truly Italian standards - I'm from there and I know what I'm talking about). The last batch I got was the ""made in Thailand"" version (even though at the time the Amazon description still said ""made in Italy"") and it was just above mediocre. Pretty tasteless actually, and NOTHING compared to the Italian version. Same price though, which made me feel I had just been ripped off (and scammed, since the Amazon description had not been changed by then). NO MORE!"
"As an Italian living in the US, I find the tuna that is available in the typical supermarket tasteless. I started looking for an affordable alternative to the expensive imported brands and I came across this one. Tonno Genova is preserved in olive oil like in the mediterranean regions of Europe, and I got a 24-pack for $25.<br /><br />Bottom line is: this is not the best that you can get, but it's definitely the best for the price."
I've been ordering this for years. The first shipments were amazing. The most wonderful taste and moist and flavorful. The first order I think was in the low $20's for 24 cans. Now it's almost double. The last shipment was dry and hard and not at all the same as the wonderful tuna I used to get. I won't order this again as it's not the same product it once was. I just looked at the can and it said Thailand too. No thanks!
I have been buying Genova Tonno Solid Light Tuna In Olive Oil (5 ounce) for years it was always good and dependable with the exception of an occasional can being somewhat saltier but still good. In the last six months(July-Dec 2010) the quality has declined significantly. I thought that perhaps I bought a bad can or so and I foolishly continued to buy Genova Tonno hoping that possibly it was just a change in processing or suppliers and that I could once again buy Genova with the confidence that it was a quality tuna. The best by dates on the cans is 2014.The Genova Tonno of the last six months can only be described as dry and tasteless.I will NOT be buying Genova Tonno it has gone from what I considered the best tuna to the absolute worst tuna.
Me and my husband love this and I must admit I am frugal and try to get the cheap stuff still but he refuses to eat it. This is so much better than the tidbit leftovers sold in regular grocery stores.
"This tuna may have been packed in Italy but it distinctly says on the bottom of the case ""Product of Thailand"". Not what it was and my local grocer has it for about the same price when it goes on sale."
"We love this tuna!  A while back our store revamped itself and stopped carrying Genova.  We asked them if they would bring it back, but so far it hasn't happened.  So when we found we could order it through Amazon.com we jumped at the opportunity.  Thank you.  Now we're going to order another case so we won't run out.  Life is Good"
"I ordered this tuna from Amazon about one year ago for the first time and I fell in love with it!! Sure, it was a considerably more expensive than the average supermarket brand tuna, but oh my god the flavor was unmatched! Unfortunately it seems that things have changed. Beware customers, Amazon is lying to you, this is NOT ITALIAN TUNA ANYMORE. The label clearly says product of Thailand. And yes, you can definitely taste the difference. Sadly this is not the top quality tuna it was before. The olive oil too seems to be watered down a bit. Shame on Amazon for telling lies and shame on the company for taking away what was the best tuna on the market."
"If you like tuna in oil, you will enjoy this product. Excellent taste, appearance and texture. Keep in mind that not all 'tuna in oil' is in olive oil - this one is. It is sooooo good that many folks will not need to add mayonnaise, thereby saving calories. Free Prime shipping was enough to seal the deal, as this item is heavy. Shipping from Peapod would have cost almost as much as the tuna. Delivered Amazon cost was only about $1.00 per can. We supply lunch to our employess - even if each person eats two cans, this is a bargain compared to the local deli, which charges around $7.00 for a sandwich. All considered, this is a winner and we have reordered several times."
"Excellent product and fast shipping. This is the best tasting tuna on the market today. After eating this, I don't know how anyone could eat the ""packed in water"" canned tuna generally available on the market today."
"Sad to say this tuna is no longer from Italy (as advertised) but from Thailand. I won't be ordering any more.<br /><br />09-03-2010 Taste tested it...no comparison to the moist, flavorful Italian tuna, this Thailand tuna is dry and bland in comparison."
"Instead of from Italy (Amazon still claim it's from Italy), this tuna is now from Thailand. The taste definitely changes (in a bad way). Price is higher. I hope the Italian version of this tuna can come back."
"this is the best tuna i have ever had,not like the american tuna that is like mush,this tonno is solid pcs that taste like tuna"
"IT WAS FROM  ITALY AND VERY GOOD. THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION STATES FROM ITALY, NOT SO!! OUALITY HAS SURELY GONE DOWNHILL!!!! NO MORE ORDERS.<br /><br />SUEGGESTION, RAISE PRICE TO KEEP QUALITY."
This used to be decent tuna as recently as 6 months ago. The last two orders have been dissppointing in that these are supposedly packaged in Olive Oil. There is virtually no Olive oil in whatever the watery liquid is that runs out of the can. The consumer is then treated to the driest tuna ever! You have been warned....
"Your product reference states that product is made in Italy,whereas shipping carton is marked made in Thailand, will the real country please come forward. By the way I rate this Tuna Five Stars, Best ever at this price."
"I ordered the 3-oz cans of Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), pack of 24.  These are the smaller cans of tuna (single-serving for me).<br /><br />Until I tried these, I would only eat solid white albacore tuna (in spring water).  I've tried all the major brands, from Bumblebee to Starkist to Chicken of the Sea.  In my opinion, something has changed over the past few years to these major brands.  The solid white albacore I had been buying was often ""mushy"" and inconsistent in quality.<br /><br />After reading the reviews on the Chicken of the Sea Genova Tonno (tuna), I was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.  Since the product wasn't ""solid white albacore"" tuna, and was packed in oil (olive oil), I had a few lingering doubts.  However, at the time of my purchase, the item was on sale and there was a Chicken of the Sea promotion that lowered the price.  That was enough incentive for me to make my purchase (good move, Amazon!).<br /><br />I tried my first can the day after receiving the product, and I've enjoyed several cans since then.  THIS is how tuna is supposed to be -- how it USED to be.  It flakes beautifully; every can I've opened has had the same quality consistency with NO ""mushiness"".  The flavor is excellent, in my opinion.  I never thought I would enjoy ""non-albacore"" tuna, and now I don't think I'll ever go back."
"Like the other reviews here, I agree that this is the best canned tuna I've had since childhood, when tuna in oil was the only way you could buy it.<br /><br />The fish is moist and flakey, and when mixing for tuna salad, doesn't require much mayo to make a nice mix.  The small cans are nice to pack for lunch, but I'd prefer larger cans since I usually make enough for myself and my husband at the same time.<br /><br />I normally never eat any canned tuna other than white chunk albacore, so to take a shot in the dark and purchase solid light tuna took a leap of faith.  But since the reviews were so glowing, I took a chance and I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />I really hope Amazon gets more of this product back in stock.  I went to order more today and was sad to see I couldn't , especially since they've got 20% off on Chicken of the Sea products until the end of the month.  Maybe they'll get the larger cans in stock too this time?  I'm hoping!"
Honestly!!!<br />this is the best canned tuna i have EVER tasted....<br />i'm addicted to it now..<br />the first can i opened struck me as a bit to salty.<br />but the flavor made up for it.<br />and by the next day on my second can i didn't even notice.<br />i think it may have just been my taste buds being in shock over the wonderful quality :)
"How do I love the, let me count the ways:<br /><br /> This is the BEST tasting tuna I have ever had!<br /><br /> All white meat and packed in olive oil.<br /><br /> Healthy and perfect size to pack in my lunch for work.<br /><br /> Addictive and a taste I now crave!"
"First off...the false advertisement states 'made in Italy'...this product is """"""MADE IN THAILAND!""""""  Shame on you, Amazon, for not changing the description when others have posted this same concern in their reviews. I should have listened to the reviewers but thought by now Amazon would have fixed the error!  Instead of Mediterranean Tuna we are buying Tuna that hasn't seen the Mediterranean Sea but instead the South Sea.  I am very curious as to how this changes the toxic, heavy metal counts as Italy has a high ethic standard to packaging food with the Made In Italy statement vs other countries...Thailand for one.<br /><br />As for the taste, it's tuna packed in olive oil which, to me, tastes better than water-packed.  I've never bought it pre-Thailand (actually Made in Italy)so can't compare if it's changed.  It's a good tuna, my cats love it, and I will use it...but will be very concerned how many contaminants I'm eating along with the seafood :(<br /><br />Just be aware of what you are buying BEFORE you order this if it makes a difference to you!<br /><br />ETA:  THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR ADDING 'MADE IN THAILAND' in the description!<br /><br />After quite a few cans of this tuna, it is still good tasting and a perfect individual size."
"I received my most recent order of this item today, and am very disappointed that the can from Thailand is only a pop-top; the cans from Italy could be opened with a regular can opener, although a so-called ""easy open"" tab was also supplied.  The reason I have purchased the Genova from Italy many times is because I could use a can opener, having once sliced my hand very badly trying to open a can of Starkist tuna with a pop-top.  Even though I bought a special opener for these pop-tops, they are extremely hard for me to open, and had I known that the supplier is now in Thailand instead of Italy as I expected, I wouldn't have taken a chance on the can being changed and not ordered it (long ago I got the Genova from Italy in an Italian deli in Santa Monica, California, so knew I could use a regular can opener on them).  I did manage to get one can open from this new shipment, and the contents are very different also from my previous orders.  There is a huge amount of oil, instead of just a small amount, and the tuna is a different color and texture.  The oil and tuna are tastless compared to what I had so many times before from Italy."
"come'on Amazon!  i received a great order last year, and came back now to this price? Are you sure you aren't confusing the 3oz with the large size?  No order here.  FYI last years order was 5 star."
This tuna is very tasty right out of the can.  The oil is light and just the right amount.  It's not drowning in oil like most.  I tried this after reading the reviews on here and they're right.  It's like a whole different type of fish compared to local store brands.  Definitely recommend trying this tuna.
"This is a full flavored but not overpowering Tuna.  It works in cooked dishes without losing flavor and Sandwiches are really good also.  I used it both drained and not drained.  I like it best undrained.  This surprised me as I originally thought it would be too oily.  Not so, and the flavor is enhanced.  REally surprised as aI did not think an American made Italian style tuna could be as good as the Italian made."
"Perfect size for brown bagging.  It may be small, but you still get big chunks of tuna, not that mushy stuff sold in grocery stores.  It is packed in olive oil, not water - I never liked the water packed tuna.  Genova Tonno Tuna is a staple of my workday lunch."
"My wife and I took a trip to Europe and she fell in love with Tuna in olive oil.When we got back home, there were not many places to find it and if we did it was really expensive. We found this Genova tuna online and ordered right away. It was at our house within 2 days and ended up costing about the same price as a regular can of tuna at the store. This is a great deal!"
"This would be excellent canned tuna except for one thing.  It is TOO SALTY!!!  It is, by far, the best tuna we've had in many decades.  We can't believe how good it is.  Actual big chunks of flavorful tuna accentuated by the subtle, yet present, flavor of the olive oil.  Unbelievably good, but simply much, much too salty!  The saltiness hits your tongue after the exquisite taste of the tuna/olive oil and drowns out that taste.  What was Chicken of the Sea thinking???  Why would they try to ruin an exceptionally excellent product with far too much salt?  Frankly, we are disgusted with the amount of salt the food industry tries to force upon us instead of allowing us to savor the true taste of our food.  (As you know, too much salt is bad for your health, as well.)  This quality product does not deserve to be drowned in salt.  The pop-top cans on this 3-ounce size are a little hard to open, but the nice thing is that there are NO sharp edges left on top or can after opening (unlike most of this style top).  This size serving is a nice addition to a lunch box or to top a salad or rice with.  If you don't mind the salt, this is one excellent product.  We will buy this again, but not in the quantities we would, if it were less salty.  We want to limit our salt intake and this product would be, oh so much, better with less of it.  Hope this helps you decide!"
This used to be hands down the best canned tuna in the world. Recent shipment show it to be now a product of Thailand<br />and the processing is completely different ie using very little olive oil and a lot of water. Disappointing to say the<br />least!!!
"This tuna has excellent flavor, and I keep several cans at work and at home. It's perfect for lunch or a snack, in a salad or by itself.  It is sooo much tastier than dry, water packed tuna.  I do prefer the larger 5 ounce cans that require a can opener, and wish they were available on subscribe and save.  As conveniect as the little pull tab cans are, they are so small that it's hard to get good leverage to open them.  I have fairly large hands for a woman.  Maybe someone with smaller hands would do better with the tiny cans.<br /><br />I give 5 stars to the tuna, but 3 or less to the can, which is why I gave it a 4, not a 5 rating."
"Thought I would try this tuna after reading the reviews.  The price is very reasonable and with delivery to my door, I love this.<br /><br />I think I'm going to be loving subscribe and save. No shipping fee, bulk items delivered to my door (I live in a high rise condo) I'm a customer for as long as Amazon keeps the system.<br /><br />Fab tuna. You HAVE to try it."
"this tuna is the tastiest I have ever eaten.  I have always purchased albacore in water, but this is much better.  I do drain off a  bit of the oil, but since it's olive oil, I guess it's OK.  It's convenient also, having a 24 pack delivered to your door.  I'm a customer for life.  I also am happy when free shipping is included."
"Given the choice, I'd eat tuna packed in olive oil pretty much every day. Alas, mercury levels say it is not to be. Still, with a few crackers it makes an excellent lunch to keep in case of emergency at the office. Add half an avocado if you're feeling extra-festive. Don't keep that part at the office, though. Also excellent over pasta, perhaps with some lemon and capers or a few olives.<br /><br />This tuna is just salty enough to be tasty with nothing added, moist, and most cans consist of fairly large chunks. Some cans have smaller, shreddier bits, but on the whole it's of excellent quality.<br /><br />I had consistently purchased the Genova brand at local shops, but with Subscribe and Save, Amazon offers a better price. And you definitely can't beat the convenience."
very good. i could not detect any dolphin flavor. cans are tiny so multiples are needed for a sandwich. the cats and dogs would give this a thumbs up (if they had thumbs).
"We drain this well of oil and mix it with a large can of water packed tuna.  We still get the flavor, but reduce the calories."
"I bought this based on other reviews and I have to say after trying it that this stuff is nothing short of delicious... While it is packed in oil it isn't swimming in it, and besides, the oil tastes good.<br /><br />Normally with canned tuna, I would use it for salads and sandwiches but It is so good, that I've already gone through half the case and so far I've only eaten it straight out of the can spread on crackers like you would with sardines."
"Perfect smaller size for lunch. Generous serving if being used on regular sized bread for a tuna sandwich. I like to put it on top of a simple spinach salad or roll it up inside lettuce leaves for a fast, healthy meal. Really great taste, far better than the Starkist I used to eat before I found this -- and cheaper per ounce too! The taste is a little more salty than usual for canned tuna, but I like that. Of the four people in my household, two us like this tuna better and two of us don't calling it too salty. There is minimal olive oil in the can but as I always squeeze out the excess oil, letting it pour down the sink before taking out the tuna, I like the less oil too. I used 'subscribe and save' and this will be the tuna I eat from now on (unless the price increases dramatically). It's nice to have pantry staples delivered to my door on a regular basis, thanks Amazon!"
"There was actually more usable chunk tuna in one 3 oz. Tin of Genova than a 6oz Tin of Star Kist tuna, which was shredded and shrank down to about 1/3rd weight after draining the water. With the 6oz. can of ""XXX"" I only had enough to make ½ sandwich but the mayo and onions tasted good.<br />I made a tuna salad sandwich with Genova, green onions and celery with mayo on an onion bun. You will not need to add salt. I just drained the oil from the can and mixed it with the ingredients.<br />I intend to use this with a green salad mix or even pasta.<br /><br />Although I do like salt, next time I may try rinsing the tuna in a colander but not pressing it. With some of the shredded stuff you may just end up with a spoon-full.<br />For quick meals, I used to like Hot-Dogs but not any more. The taste of this yellow-fin tuna is quite good, actually much better than I had expected. Some of the tuna you get from the local grocery store may look like cat food when you open it up. This definitely does not.<br />I will buy it again because you can't beat the Amazon price with Free Shipping."
"I like to have small cans of tuna around for a somewhat healthy an afternoon snack at work.  The ""line caught"" albacore products are superb -- I have bought them here on Amazon and on various websites including some maintained by the fishermen themselves.  Great stuff, but much as I want to support this kind of fishing and eat those products, it is just too costly for me to do so on a regular basis.  In looking for alternatives, I tried the Tonno light tuna in olive oil.  Obviously, Amazon's cost, especially with free shipping, is hard to beat.  As importantly, this is really a delicious product.  Nice look and texture and tastes good (right out of the can).  I am very happy with this and recommend it, especially at the current price of less than $30 for 24 cans!"
This is the best tuna I have eaten in a very long time.  I am a senior citizen and it reminds me of the tuna my mom used to buy when I was a kid.  It must be the olive oil. I definitely recommend this brand.
This is good quality tuna. It doesn't say what species on the can but I am guessing tongol. Stays nice and moist in the olive oil. 3oz cans are perfect for 1 portion.
"Finally, good Tuna made only better by the Olive Oil - no more water packed for me..."
"Absolutely the best - delicious tasting and packed with olive oil, not some disgusting, rancid vegetable oil. I've started eating tuna again because someone turned me on to this wonderful product."
"Hard to find product in the store either for the 3oz or 5oz cans but a great tasting product and seems to be a much higher quality tuna in the can than a normal can of Starkist.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone, easy to drop on a salad for some extra protein."
"Last year I purchased a case of this tuna at a similar price.  I was foolish enough, when the offer appeared again that I did not notice the differences.  Last years offer was for 24 5 ounce cans.  This year it was for 3 ounce cans.<br />Effectively it is cheaper for me to buy this tuna at my local supermarket than to buy it through you<br />My mistake"
Used to get this by the case at Costco and they stopped selling it.<br />Always loved it and still do.<br />When I saw this on subscribe and save I bought it immediately and have been ever since.<br />Genova simply makes the best light tuna in olive oil; and I've tried many brands.<br />Enjoy!
"Having worked in the canned seafood industry, I sampled this product at work for consistency, quality, and taste. It was EXCELLENT back in 2007. I soon relied on this product for lunch (with Ritz crackers, Genova Tonno was very, very good) and also sometimes for snacks. I'd buy them in bulk here on Amazon at reasonable prices.<br /><br />Having worked with canned tuna, I can tell you the prices of the ""commodity"" have gone way up across the board for light tuna (e.g. skipjack) and white tuna (e.g. albacore). This is due to increased fishing cost and decreased supply of fish. As sad of an issue as overfishing due to the trawling methods, the reality is we're seeing this reflected in the cost and quality of various seafood products, most notably via the traditional 6oz cans being downsized to 5oz first by Starkist followed by other shelf stable seafood manufacturers.<br /><br />So this Genova Tonno product USED TO BE chunks of tuna in extra virgin olive oil with a nice balanced amount of salt. However, this product is now watery chunky tuna that has a bit of olive oil in it. And in case you didn't know, Genova is owned by Chicken of the Sea, who is actually owned by a Thai based company called Thai Union, which has its own packing facilities in Thailand. THIS IS NOT ITALIAN TUNA, do not let the name fool you. It is Italian-style, and like most of Chicken of the Sea products, Genova Tonno is packed in Thailand. Genova products are still very good and of a decent quality, but it just is not what it used to be because of the rising costs.<br /><br />Given the higher prices of this product, I no longer recommend this due to the $2+ per 3oz can price tag. This used to make for a relatively healthy, affordable and delicious lunch or snack, but it is now not a very good value. I recommend other alternatives (skip the pre-made canned tuna spread, it's got too much mayo and salt in it). Or consider making your own Tonno/olive oil tuna. Just try and look for ""natural"" tuna if you can since trusted brands' old fashioned canned tuna in water contains vegetable broth/hydrolized protein that is injected to allow the fish to soak up more water (industry's dirty little secret). There are plenty of fast and easy to prepare tuna/salmon options online if you look close hard enough on Amazon..."
"Without question, the best readily available canned tuna in olive oil for the price.  Once you've eaten tuna in olive oil, you'll never to back to the wretched catfood that's referred to as tuna packed in water.  It's good enough to eat out of the can, and great with capers and chopped onion on a salad.<br /><br />BTW, those posters who complain that that Genova was at one time Italian sourced tuna are misinformed.  ""Genova"" is simply the trade name used by Chicken of the Sea for its Yellowfin tuna packed in olive oil (packing in olive oil is the traditional method of preservation for Mediterranean caught tuna).  It was once canned in American Samoa, but is now processed in Thailand.  It has never been Italian sourced."
"To me, tuna packed in olive oil is far superior to tuna packed in water.  This tuna is flavorful without being heavy or oily.  This size can is perfect for a lunch.  Buying it by the case makes it very inexpensive.  Love the free shipping!"
I was hungry and picked up a can. for $1.69 I had a tastey low calorie high protien cheeep meal. I did not see anything on the can that says italy or thailand.  It was moist and did not smell fishy. I am full now. I would buy more.
"I have tried several other brands of Tuna in olive oil and find this brand the best when it comes to quality, taste and cost"
This is a very mild delicious tuna that is packed in olive oil. It is much tastier than water packed or soy bean oil packed tuna. Nice quality tuna in each and every can. With very little mayo you can make a moist tuna salad or eat it straight out of the can. These are smaller cans than the standard grocery store size. Because olive oil is used it is a great to topping for a salad without the added use of dressing.Very good tuna that I would highly recommend!
"This product is not only so good, but also comes at such a good price, that I am left speechless. Suffice it to say your search ends here: this is the ultimate canned tuna, period."
"My wife thoroughly enjoys good tuna packed in olive oil.  Such was available locally until several years ago.  It disappeared completely.  We found this product at Amazon and are very pleased with it.  We would recommend it to anyone who has an appetite for this type of product.  It is typical of the competitively priced, high quality products available on Amazon."
"I normally buy top quality tuna packed in water from Amazon to avoid the genetically modified soy found in the water packed tuna in the grocery stores.  I also avoid tuna packed in genetically modified cottonseed oil and/or soy oil.<br /><br />This is the first time I've been willing to pay extra for tuna packed in olive oil so I can't compare this brand of tuna in olive oil to the really expensive ones.  It does not specify extra virgin olive oil and I noticed that the oil was quite light in color, but - trusting that it is actually olive oil and not canola sneaked in dishonestly - the flavor was very good.<br /><br />This is delicious, really meaty tuna.  It is packed solid with no ""little fish flakes"" in the can.  All I had to do was chop celery really fine and add a bit of fresh lemon juice and it was as good as - or better than - the tuna salad I make with all kinds of other things in it.<br /><br />The only criticism is that quite a few of the cans were dented, but not enough to make them unusable. This has been a problem with other canned goods ordered from Amazon.  However, to be fair, there are a lot of dented cans of everything on the shelves in my local supermarkets, so I don't think it is necessary an ""Amazon problem"".<br /><br />For a really fast, healthy and delicious meal for one, this tuna is terrific.  I will be ordering it again, for sure."
"Love this stuff. Add some cannelli beans, lemon juice, salt and better. Put over salad or on bread. Very healthy quick meal."
"Love this tuna, it's a bit spendy, but for me it's worth it. I find that a lot of tuna lately has no flavor at all.  I could eat this by itself right out of the can.  I use it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPRNGS"">Annie Chun's Rice Express Sprouted Brown Rice, 6.3-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>"
"this USED to be Italian tuna, but it's now Pacific tuna, packaged in US and Thailand<br />I find it quite deceiving to call it ... ""Tonno Genova""!"
We have ordered this product three times before anf it was top notch.  This order is 10 times too salty and I can't eat it.
"Those who remember canned tuna from the 30's,40's and 50's won't accept this tuna as ""good"".  It's passable, but not what I was looking to find."
"Wonderful taste for twice-a-week consumers,great taste for us regular American gals=non-fussy,conservative for the majority of Americans....Tuna keeps us able to function-regardless of whether we're actresses or pipe fitters...keep that realistic food coming...keep your arugulas for the nut job metrosexual lefties of the metrosexual nut jobs...real ,realistic Americans need meat and variety....Mexican guys will side with this..."
"Great taste, very refreshing.  Comes in other flavors too.  Just sweet enough for me so I don't add sugar at all."
This is a wonderful product. I add a teaspoon to a cup of lemonade. Adjust for your own taste. Thanks Teisseire.
"Just smelling this bottle makes my toes curl in strawberry-induced euphoric pleasure. &lt;3<br />This is really sugary though, and the strawberry flavor isn't as strong as it's smell. That makes me a sad person.<br /><br />I think Teisseire would sell better if they expanded to a fruit-perfume business. Yes..."
Good price but the coffee lacks aroma and flavor. To be a Colombian you expect more Arabic qualities. Also require extra ammount to get a decent flavor.
I like this coffee. It is definitely not my all time favorite but it is good for the price. It is a bit bitter compared to other types of coffee but I like it enough to try a different one from  this seller.
My husband and I use these when we don't want to cook a side.<br /><br />They have so much oil though that I feel guilty throwing it out after we're done. I have saved the oil before and put it into a salad with balsamic vinegar the next day.
"And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole Corriander Seeds 7oz, and a generous ladling of the Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12) also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon.<br /><br />Great shelf life in this packaging, patiently awaiting your most tender mercies and privileged attentions, but out here in this desert I still keep it in the fridge!"
No one would ever guess its sugarfree. It is very thick and very choclotate. It does not stir into milk...be aware. its a great topping.
"OMG YUMMY!!  really! So good, it's like sugar free magic in a bottle.  I was hesitant thinking it may be chalky like many similar products, but it is simply devine.  ordered an entire case.  good on coffee, mixed in milk, on desserts is it's star roll."
"I read a lot of reviews before I ordered this.  I ordered it yesterday afternoon (10-10-12) it arrived around 9:30 today (10-11-12)!!!  Totally amazed at the speed of delivery.  Even more amazing is the taste of this.  You totally can not tell it is sugar free and the dark chocolate flavor is spot on.  It is really really good in hot coffee - I can't wait to try it in iced coffee!  Thanks Monin and Amazon!  PS: our office staff loves it too, I think I better order another six pack while I am online ;)"
"I love the tropical flavor of this trail mix.  The blend of bananas, mango, pineapple, glazed walnuts, granola chunks,slivered coconut and cashews provides not only a healthey snack  the 2.25 ounce bag not only is the perfect snack size it also keeps you from eating too much because of it so good.  I recommend this great snack, it's great for kids lunches; mid-moring or afternoon snack. Try the money saving delivery so you can keep it on hand.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M08XSS"">Emerald Nuts Tropical Blend, 2.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
They gave these snacks packs out right after the Houston Half Marathon and they HIT THE SPOT! I was sad to see that it was not available anywhere else but Amazon and waited until they emailed me a notification that they were here. A MUST TRY!
It's pretty simple - if you aren't a big fan of raisins in your trail mix - and you like the other ingredients - you are going to LOVE this trail mix!!
I planned on going for a hike in the mountains while on vacation so my wife picked up some snacks for me. These were one of those snacks. I was surprised at how good and addicting they are. They seem to be the only flavor out of stock every time I visit the store so that's why I ordered them from Amazon. There are several flavors but the tropical is the best. Reminds me of my hike every time I have a package.
"As soon as I received notification that this was available I immediately ordered it. I have only been able to find this product in a CVS 40 minutes from where I live (I wasn't really checking every store locally). I love the taste of the coconut bits and mango pieces. I keep some at work, take some on trips and always have a pack in my purse. Can't wait for them to be available again!"
I am a huge fan of Trail mix and a huge fan of Coconut! Well this tropical mix taste great! I order it online all of the time. Can't seem to find it in the stores.
These were a great addition to some homemade granola bars since dark chocolate chips are practically impossible to find locally.
"I've been gluten free for about 4 years and I've really missed chocolate cake.  No matter what I've tried it's gritty or just doesn't have a deep and satisfying taste.  I picked this up at a natural food store, always willing to try something new if it's chocolate.<br /><br />WOW!  I made cupcakes, and frosted them with dark chocoate frosting.  Unbelievably good!  The first time I made these I forgot to add the water, they turned out like a rich chocolate brownie (that's okay too!).  They are full of flavor, have just the right amount of sweetness and do not taste like a typical gluten free product.  This is priceyer than other GF mixes but trust me, worth every penny!!"
I was very pleased with the quickness of delivery of this product.  The product was just as we expected with Brach's mints that we have purchased for years.  They are the best. They need to change the packaging from the twist ends to the pressed for ease of taking them out of the package.  The only problem is that it was made in Mexico and not the USA.
"Several years back, Hannaford Grocery stores- was bought by Delhaize (a Belgium Co.) and one of the changes they made was to replace Brach's Peppermints with the ""Hannaford"" peppermint--made with ""artificial flavors"".  In a moment of final frustration, I checked Google and discovered Brach's Star Brite peppermints, made with natural peppermint oils, were still available.  What a joy!  I will never buy Hannaford ""Star Lites"" again, even if I run out of Brach's Star Brites temporarily."
I live in work in a foreign country so it's nice to have good American products that I can purchase and receive on line.
"I've been sampling jerky products across the US for nearly 40 years now. Many of the products that I've sampled have been of the home-made variety, including jerky that I've made. Most store-bought jerky products are drenched in MSG or its twin brother, ""hydrolyzed vegetable protein."" After watching the seizure-like symptoms that the MSG in meat snacks has caused in my dogs, I will no longer buy ANY products that contain MSG or hydrolyzed vegetable protein!! However, that made finding a decent jerky product extremely difficult.<br /><br />I purchased the Oberto BBQ Pork Jerky with more than a bit of skepticism. I hadn't liked any of the Oberto beef jerky products that I had tried in the past. The ""All Natural"" claim on the label of this BBQ Pork Jerky convinced me to give it a try. Once I did sample it this product blew me away!! It is incredibly moist, tender and delicious! Think of all the things that people generally say that they dislike about jerky products (dry, too chewy, too salty, etc.) and this product engenders NONE of those complaints! Plus, it does appear to be the most natural (i.e., no preservatives or artificial flavor enhancers) jerky product that I've found available commercially. Enjoy!"
"Everything about this coffee order was great. My only question was that we ordered decaf, but nowhere on the packaging  (carton or individual cups) does it say that it is decaf. So, did we get decaf or not?"
I never knew there could be such a difference in the quality of peanuts as these. They are large very flavorful and extra crunchy if that's possible. I generally do not like unsalted peanuts however these have such a great flavor I like them without salt. These peanuts are good enough for friends or family to comment on after trying them. I've had a lot of friends try royal oak peanuts and I can basically sum up their expressions in one word WOW! Highly recommend.
"The cans were so badly dented, when I opened the box, that the lids were off and no longer will fit back on. I am not sure how the peanuts are, but the Amazon packaging is a joke (as it is for most of their items these days). Also, the nuts expire in 3 months! A fresh batch would normally expire in a year. This is the third foodstuff that I have purchased on Amazon that was going to expire in the same month that I bought it or within three months. The last two were on sale (though the soon-to-be-met expiration date should've been noted by Amazon). These nuts aren't even on sale!  Now I am wondering about other foodstuffs that I have purchased here at Amazon. Looking at expiration dates from a reputable source isn't something I thought I should have to do. hmmm"
"I received the Blueberry Pomegranate flavor of Mareblu Naturals.  I have been trying to eat healthier and enjoy snacks that are natural and that I understand every ingredient in the list!<br /><br />The bag that I ate was supposed to have three servings, but like the other reviewers, I couldn't stop at just one serving.  I ate the entire bag!<br /><br />A few specifics.  The sweetening is light enough to really let the flavor of the nuts and berries come through.  All of the nuts are fresh and crunchy.  I love that the clusters are substantial and not just little bits.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying and reviewing the other flavors!"
"The only drawback is if you can't stop at one bag, don't buy them. They're good and they are fresh, as well as a good source of protein and healthy fats."
"Good ingredients, tastes good, but there are about 3-4 little nuggets in the bag.  I was hungry when I bought them; the only halfway nutritious sounding thing in the company vending machine.  I was still almost as hungry afterwards.  The calorie content seemed about right, a little over 100 calories per bag if memory serves, but I was disappointed by how little was in the bag."
"I bought one bag of Mareblu Naturals Trail Mix in a vending machine, and bought every other bag they had. I enjoyed them so much I bought the for my friends. They are easy to snack on because they are made in bite size pieces. Great flavor! I would recommend you buy two packs of 10! I bought one and when family tasted one from my bag, they would go out and get a bag for themselves. Buy and enjoy!"
"I first tried this Trail Mix when it was offered on USAir as part of their on board snack selections which you can purchase.  It sounded good, I bought a bag and yummed through every bite.  Came home and couldn't find it in the grocery store so I went on Amazon.com and purchased it through the subscribe and save program.  I can't say enough good about this crunchy snack, other than, it's great.  Try it."
"The nuts in this mix are okay and some taste as if they have been sprinkled with blueberry dust but out of the 10 pack I think I actually saw two blueberries and no pomegranates. The flavor is not bad but the description is very misleading, don't buy this if you are expecting or wanting to have an even distribution of fruit and nuts."
"Love it!! high price, great taste.  Costco sells a similar product for less than 40 cents per ounce, but not nearly as good.  This is like Godiva vs Hershey"
"We have a number of cats.  Only one older female enjoys this catmilk.  The rest tend to ignore it.  I recommend a person try one first to see if their cat/s will accept it and then go from there.  If you have two or more cats that like this catmilk, this is a very good bulk deal at the right price."
"Found this bread last month. Compared with any other bread (German and otherwise), it's heavy, but much cheaper - this box gives me 84 Slices, meaning 84 full meals, adding GermanDeli.com Liverwurst, Teawurst and Jagdwurst as well as Mayonnaise <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VN59NQ"">Kraft Spoonables Extra-Heavy Mayonnaise, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />Have been on an all-protein diet. After eating a couple of slices on the first day, the elimination was easier, thicker, and I feel lighter.<br /><br />I warmly recommend this bread for those and possibly more reasons I forgot to mention."
"I love this bread because it allows me to always have good bread without freezing it!  I have a stack of these in my pantry and all times and one in the fridge that I am using. It is perfect for sandwiches, though be forewarned it can be a bit fragile and you will need to toast it.  Every now and then I will supplement this bread with fresh bread from the market and such but it is nice to know I always have this around and it doesn't go bad."
"Thanks to Amazon I am able to purchase on a regular automatic shipment this excellent bread from Mestemacher, their bakery goods I already knew from Germany. This bread brings me the exact taste back when living in Europe. The bread is not too moist, grains have a wonderful taste, simply very good bread."
"I may try some of the other types of this product, but the Three Grain does not taste good to me;  too strong a scent of mollasses, I think it is, and does not taste good, even toasted.  Awful, really."
"This is a good product to heat up as a simple side dish for lazy nights. It is a little garlicky but I like garlic so the flavor does not bother me. It isn't overpowering, I just didn't expect to taste garlic so I was kind of surprised. (I didn't read the ingredients) This is a great product, either way."
"I never before found a can that combines brown rice, per say, and beans. You heat it up and add some tasty choice of Beef, Fowl, Seafood or Veggies and you have a standard meal ready to be consumed. I have come to appreciate Eden Organic. Yes, I admit that I usually add a little more salt, pepper and herbs but in the end they do taste very good. I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!"
"Excellent quality and great tasting.  Eden Organics foods are natural and low in sodium without preservatives,artificial flavorings, additives, or fillers.  Plus Eden Organics does not use the plastic can liner containing Bisphenol A.  Eden Organics cans are BPA free unlike all other canned food.  One of my favorites when you need to make dinner in under ten minutes.  I wish Amazon would offer the Eden Organics foods with the Subscribe & Save option though."
"When I received my box of cans, almost half were dented and the tops rounded up indicating that there was bacteria causing pressure.  I would not buy this product again.  Also, it tastes very bland."
Make your own rice and use the Eden bean of your choice for a better dinner.  The canned beans are great.
"I must say I like the Birch wood better.<br />My retailer stopped providing free shipping<br />and also jacked up the price. Therefore I<br />ordered this instead.<br />It is an acceptable replacement,<br />no ill effects...does the job.<br />I would prefer Birch though."
Recently ordered Epic Dental 100% Xylitol sweetener from Amazon. My brother with diabetes recommended this sweetener to me.<br />I would recommend this sweetener to family and friends. It is a very good substitute for sugar. They call it the healthy sugar twin.
"I was having a large party and could not find the ""spring"" vegetable, only the vegetable soup mix.  I use the spring vegetable for a wonderful shrimp dip.  After going to four stores and still not finding it I thought ""Amazon""!  Yep, there it was and I ordered a case.  Won't have to worry about finding it again for some time.  Love it!  Get it!"
"This stuff is amazing, works exactly as claimed. is mild tasting, so not bad at all as a tea. My wife and I both use with success and results in 10 min."
"At first with all of the Chinese lettering I was skeptical because I didn't know what it said. I tried a cup and found it to be pretty good Earl Grey. If your looking for a great tasting earl grey, I think this is it - do not be turned off by the Chinese wording."
"This food is considered highly palatable and my dogs love it. I've actually never met a dog that didn't like it (even though the other review says her pets don't like it). My dogs like to eat this any way that it is prepared, but many pets enjoy it broken up into pieces and then hydrated with water.  Tepid water may be used, but very warm water or hot water will degrade (denature) the proteins and enzymes, so it isn't recommended.  It can be used to top dry food or can be fed alone. If you have a medium or large sized dog, this will be an expensive food. However, if you have a little dog, it could be fed alone. I feed this in addition to the Nature's Variety Instinct Dry food that can be found on Amazon as well. The subscribe and save option has saved me a lot of money."
I received the product in a timley manner and the quality of the product was excellent!  Thanks for good service.
This is the best gluten-free pasta we have ever tried. This very versatile pasta is easy to cook and doesn't stick together or fall apart.
"I chose this pasta because I have a gluten allergy.  After trying rice pasta, which was much too mushy, I happened upon this. Like regular pasta, the texture holds up well after boiling.  I can't say that it tastes better or worse than regular pasta, but it does the job for me."
"This is good pasta for those who have gluten problems. Cooking this was a tough job at first because at usual heat for pasta this becomes a starchy paste in 1/2 the time. So i actually wasted two packets before searching google to learn ""how to cook corn pasta?"". The key is very low heat with lots of stirring. But It turned out to be good and tasty finally"
This is the best sub I have found for wheat pasta.  You do want to make sure you don't overcook it as it breaks apart otherwise.  Good flavor.
"Great gluten free pasta does not stick. The family (husband, wife and 5 kids )  loves it.  Great price too. I love pairing with Butler Soy Curls just cook and toss and add vegetables and you are done."
"I am a mom and have Celiac disease, so I'm always looking for options for pasta that the whole family will enjoy (gluten intolerant or not).  This pasta everyone loves and it also has the vegetable pasta included... so it's an added benefit."
"Taste is good, color holds up, however, noodles fall apart easily, hard to make a pasta salad, even if slightly undercooked.  Serves its purpose for wheat free diet."
I thought this was the same as rotini and it is not. It is still good and provides a good alternative to wheat/ gluten products. I replace any pasta dishes with this pasta. Very good. Wish it was rotini though.
"My grandchildren LOVE the sour gummy vitamins. They really liked the sour gummy worms by Rhino, but alas, I can't find them. These were a good second choice. The big problem is keeping them from eating more than 2!"
"We're moving towards a vegetarian diet, but don't have a lot of time for food prep, so we've been testing and tasting lots of different mixes and easy to prepare foods. The Delicae Gourmet's Thai Curry Lentil Slow Cooker Soup turned out to be a delicious surprise. I saw that small box and thought, hmmm...eight servings?  Not likely.  But by the time it was done, it filled a six quart crockpot almost to the brim. The box calls for vegetable (or chicken) broth, which I made with some frozen veggies & onions.  This soup has a delicate, light flavor; a mix of many spices. Not too salty or hot spicey. We added the can of coconut milk and some ginger at the end which really brought out the ""Thai"" flavors. Best of all, everyone was too busy eating to notice that it was low cal and almost no fat. If you wanted to add meat or poultry, it would go well with either, but like I said we're really committed to vegetarian. Great deal on Amazon, which is always welcome!"
"So we had a membership with Costco and got addicted to this brand of coffee- it is about the best stuff I've had when you make it with a Toddy maker cold brewing system- I have no idea why!  I've tried our local coffee roasters, different brands and roasts from Whole Foods, and a number of other sources for beans, but it's like these are made to be cold brewed!  Great shipping as usual from Amazon, nice low acid notes with just a hint of vanilla in the background- give it a shot if you haven't before!"
"This organic coffee is consistently full bodied and flavorful bag after bag. It's a great find, and with the automatic re-order, I don't run out."
Wonderful flavor and safe with no pesticides. Organic is the ONLY way to go for true coffee drinkers. Has a robust flavor and wonderful aroma.
"i found out later that the ""king size"" is actually smaller (3.0oz) than the size of other boxes. so for about $3 less, i could have bought the 4.75oz theater size boxes. doh!"
"Having Fibromyalgia I was looking for a replacement for my beloved splenda. I have tried sweet leaf it's umm ok, truvia hated it this brand has a very strange chemically taste. I than tried PureVia finally something that taste good! By ending my dependance on splenda I have notice a substantial decrease in my pain levels caused by fibromyagia. If you suffer from FM,IBS or really any medical condition it's best to move away from highly processed foods. I highly recommend PureVia."
"you can get it for less then $2 from local grocery stores, and these guys are charging 4 times that cost."
"Everyone has their own favorite coffee and I always say ""Each to his own taste"".  However, working in Seattle for about six months ten years ago, I became a fan of Seattle's Best Blend Coffee.  For a while it was easy to find this brand even here in the southern plains.  Over the years it has become more difficult.  My last ""supplier"" was Target but they stopped carrying it a few months ago.  After doing an Amazon search I found this good offer.  I bought the ground because it's vacuum sealed and saves me the trouble of grinding.  It arrived before the promised delivery date.  I just re-ordered and this time ordered two three-packs to receive free-shipping.  A great deal for this great ""bright"" coffee."
This is great coffee - rich and flavorful without the acid.  Best price is at Amazon.
"It has been difficult to find this in the midwest and it's a treat for me! The balance is good and color is dark. The grind is fine and works great in drip brewers. For really full flavor, I recommend fine mesh filters rather than paper. I go full throttle and use a french press - the grind works okay and way better than Starbucks House Blend. The flavor is perfect for me - vive Seattle! Other faves are Seattle's Best Henry's Blend and Post Alley Blend."
"Seattle's best numbering system is honest.  I like stronger coffee so I've tried the 3, 4, and 5.  The number 3 is coffee, regular strength normal everyday coffee.  It's a good flavor, not acidic, smooth flavorful, coffee. The number 4 is strong coffee, same basic flavor as the number 3, just stronger.  It's like using a full pot worth of grounds and only brewing three quarters of a pot.  My favorite is the number 5.  Number 5 is different.  Number 5 is extremely strong flavor!  Do not use a normal amount of grounds to brew a pot, unless you're really stubborn, you'll dump the pot.  It is good though, if you use about half the normal amount of grounds you get some very tasty coffee that you can actually drink.  I bought three packs of number 3 and 4 for work.  I brought in a bag of number 5 once, but that was a big mistake.  You see not everyone understands how to brew number 5 and I had some unhappy co-workers including one that spit a mouthful at his computer screen.  Yes, it's funny now, but it wasn't then."
"Seattle's Best Coffee has a level system that makes it easy to pick the level that is right for you.  You can head to the Seattle's Best Coffee website and read all about each one and be sure that you are going to be pleased.  It couldn't be easier.  I had chosen Level 3 which is described as ""Balanced, smooth , full flavored.""  The description definitely seemed to suit me, but the test was in the brewing.<br /><br />First of all, even though I said the test was in the brewing...it is a lot more than that my friends.  What happens when you open the bag of coffee.  Does the aroma make you smile?  Does it smell so good you can't wait to try it?  Does it smell so good you can taste it?  I'm serious.  This coffee smelled good.  It had a strong aroma, but not a STRONG aroma.  It was nutty and rich scented.<br /><br />The taste...rich but not overly so.  Bold in a cheeky way (sounds silly but true).  In other words, it didn't slap me in the face, but its smooth nuttiness made just the right impression.  I am in definite like!  My husband tried it with a flavored creamer next and said that the creamer didn't overpower the flavor of the coffee like it can with others.  I don't do soy so I couldn't go in that direction, but I made myself a mocha next by adding a little chocolate syrup, and the flavor balance was fabulous.  Seattle's Best Level 3 is definitely the right mix of strong and smooth."
Great for the office and home. We buy this and Breakfast blend and alternate between the two. Everyone loves it!
"Ordered this a few weeks ago to replace Starbucks (original) Breakfast Blend, which they have now taken off the market completely and replaced with ""medium"", whatever that awful stuff is.  This Level 3 coffee does not taste like Breakfast Blend, but it has good qualities and more body than Breakfast Blend.  The first few sips are average, but the taste seems to grow the more you drink.  It is quite smooth and does not have the burnt taste as the new ""medium"" BB does."
"Seattle's Best is medium-bodied with an delicious aroma and a smooth, but complex, flavor.  Level 3 is the ideal balance, pungent yet silky.  I use this in my ""make-it-yourself"" K-cup filter and it is perfect cup every time.Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers"
"I tried Seattle's Best Level 3 after having a cup of Seattle's Best coffee at Burger King which I liked a lot. So, I tried a bag of Seattle's Best Level 3, guessing that BK's coffee would be some where in the middle of the Seattle's Best selection. WRONG!!! Every pot of Seattle's Best Level 3 I've made has that familar Starbucks burnt taste, and tastes nothing like the coffee I had at BK. Anyone know what level BK uses?"
"this is my favorite coffee. Full of flavor and not acidic at all, without that ""burnt"" taste I often taste in coffees. I wanted to try something new and went for another highly reviewed brand, which is not bad at all, but I am going back to Seattle's Best when I run out."
"SEATTLES BEST COFFEE-BRIGHT BLEND<br />BEST COFFEE IN STORES!<br />This coffee is the best and, now, the only one I buy and make every morning. It's a smooth caffeine coffee with a deep aroma and a milk chocolate-like taste. Interesting to note, I recently tried Seattles Best Decaf and that's so smooth to the point of tasteless; I'm now trying Peet's Decaf House Blend (it tastes as robust as caffeine coffee)  at night and Seattle's Best Bright Blend in the morning. I've purchased both at the A&P in Kenilworth NJ."
love this stuff. always stays fresh in your cup and literally is bright and refreshing.
"My order was placed for a No 3 decaf, but received the light roast (Seattle's Best Blend)decaf that is available at all local stores.  Would love to return for the correct item, but there does not seem to be a way to do that.  I will remember that next time I order.  What I was hopeing to get was a more bold decaf."
"I bought a bag of this in search of a mild roast, which the bag stated this was, what I saw and tasted didn't match may expectation....at all. When I opened the bag it looked very dark for a mild roast, but when I brewed my first pot, my suspicions were confirmed--it tasted like the french/dark roast stuff I drank years ago.<br /><br />I understand some people like it dark and full-bodied, but why label such a coffee ""mild""? Needless to say I won't be buying this ""mild"" roast again."
"This coffee has got to to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever purchased....It has a strong, very bitter taste....I have made 6 pots of coffee so far and each time it is horrible.....I tried using less coffee but it was still bitter.....will never buy this brand again.......I am so glad that I only purchased one bag to try......Seattle's Best is the WORST...."
"This item is literally $10 more than what you can buy it for at a store.  They sell it at Target for $3 or $4/box.  I mistakenly thought I was buying a ""bulk"" item because it was so expensive.  My fault.  But, when I asked about returning the product they said, sorry no, we believe this is a good price for this item, but if you would like we will offer you 10% off on a future purchase!  Hmm..., I don't think so.  Buyer, beware with this company, make sure you do your research first.  I did not and I payed the price."
"The juice itself tastes alright and I like that its organic but the packing is utterly stupid.  How on earth are children supposed to open them, if I, a grown adult and Im not the only one, cant get the straw through the top?? For that reason I will not be buying these juices again."
"I got bought this product to put in my husbands lunch box rather than soda or other sugary drinks. It was ok, it tastes like watered down kool-aid and its only 10% juice. My husband didnt care for it much, I wont be buying this product again."
"We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!"
"I bought these at the grocery and was pretty pumped... organic juice boxes! Sweet. Well, not really. They are pretty watered down. After slurping on one, I flipped the grape over - 10% juice. Water and cane sugar top the list of ingredients. Pretty tasteless and I feel like a bit of a sham. I can flavor my glass of water with a spritz of grape or berry. (Beware the Berry Berry Lemonade flavor is 5% juice). I will go back to Apple and Eve (60% fruit and veggie juice) or Juicy Juice (100%, though possibly from China) until I find a better organic juice box."
"I love the Grape flavor.  Some might think it too watery but for me its just right.  However, you can get it for $4/8-pack at the local store.  Why pay $10 more?"
"The prices here might not be the best, but the product is! There's nothing artificial in these juices and they taste great. We brought them to my son's basketball game when we had snack duty and the kids wanted more!"
I used this product for a birthday Celebration for my husband and it made the table really colorful. The taste was outstanding and I'm pretty sure I would purchase again.
This has become my favorite hot tea from Teavana. It satisfies my chocolate craving without overpowering the tea. Great for a cool evening or morning.
"Azteca Fire isn't as spicy as it claims, and that's not a bad thing. It's complex, chocolatey and delicious and we have to ration ourselves lest we spend all our spare money on it. :-)"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FRCVSU"">Teavana Azteca Fire Loose-Leaf Herbal Tea, 2oz</a> is something I buy by the pound. Everyone in my household adores it and it's easy to see why. We call it hot chocolate for grown ups; spicy, warm and velvety. Highly recommended."
"I ordered 6 cans of jalapeno pickled peppers, and I received 6 cans of La Lechera.  I hope this can be corrected in a timely manner."
"Sheep, baboons, elephants, horses, rabbits, lions, turtles, owls, hippos, rhinos, penguins, camels, and bears. Wonderful! Amazing! However, the packaging once again demonstrates the failure of large corporations to understand complex ecosystems, as several of the horses and sheep appear to have had their legs bitten off by the lions and bears. One camel's head was completely eaten, and I had to put it out of its misery. (crunch!) In future, one can only hope that herbivores and carnivores will be packed in separate bags."
"These are the best crackers we've tasted in a while: they are flavorful (and quite delicious!) unlike some brands that taste like cardboard, they do not crumble and/or break easily, so they arrive in perfect condition and are not messy.<br />The shapes (zoo animals and birds) are very cute too and the price is decent (I paid less than $7 per box using Subscribe and Save).<br />They do not contain milk ingredients and are *not* manufactured on the same equipment as nuts, so they are safe for ""peanut-free"" classrooms and for people with nut and milk allergies. Each individual package is large enough to share. :)<br />All that combined makes these crackers our preferred snack. Both kids and adults in our family enjoy them."
These crackers are so delicious! Addictive and not so fatty. You will not go wrong with these animal crackers.
Boxes received quickly and cookies in good state- none crumbled or broken. Tasty crackers that are hard to find in retail locations. I bought as they have no milk in them- I have a toddler with a milk allergy. Thank you.
"I used to love these but now they are ""NEW AND IMPROVED"" and they are just awful.  The texture the taste the smell is all different and really bad.  Even as I type this after eating just a few,  I can't get this industrial aftertaste out of my mouth. Never again."
"I used to eat the Austin animal crackers that contained 1.5 grams of fat per serving (2 servings per package for a total of 3 grams of fat). The 1.5 gram version really tasted better than the 2 grams of fat per serving version. The 2 grams of fat version is the latest version and what you will get from Amazon.<br /><br />On top of being a little less tasty, the 2 grams of fat version gives you 1 gram extra of fat (2 grams per serving, with a total of two servings per package).<br /><br />Another animal cracker this is better than Austin's, but more expensive, is Keebler's Elfin Crackers (almost one dollar a bag and an entire bag contains 5 grams of fat). Both Elfin and Austin use a very mild lemon flavor."
My kids love these.  They taste great and are convenient.  The animal shapes are fun for my kids to play with.  I will be re-ordering these in the future.
This was fast and great service box came in a week and i'm over seas so that was super awesome !1! and just as described
This is a great snack but I was able to find this item in Sam's Club at a cheaper price.
"When our beloved products are no longer available at Sam's or Wal-Mart, I turn to Amazon.  Bought these for a Christmas present for my husband, who loves snacks. Thanks again."
"Bought these to put in party favor goody bags.  Price was great, item arrived quickly, and cookies taste good.  Would definitely order again."
"I love these cookies, but in my last order I found five bags were opened, so due to the times we're living in, I only ate the pkgs. that were still sealed.  You would think the company would make sure all bags are sealed before sending them out to customers.  Also, some of the cookies tasted old, not fresh which was another let down for me.  I'm not sure I will be ordering these cookies again."
I love animal cookies for a low fat snack.<br />Ive tried many but these are the best<br />Unfortunately I can only get them from snack machines.<br />I ordered these and received them in less than a week. Quick shipping and great cookies.
"Very good tasting animal crackers.  Not super crunchy ones, if that's what you prefer, but just a little bit soft like the actual animal crackers that come in the little circus box.  Big bags too.  Very good price for what you get."
worked out perfectly since there are 36 packs and 18 kids in my child's Kindergarten class. Snack twice! Where else can you find that much snack for around ten bucks?
These crackers came super fast and were in pretty big bags for animal crackers. They are the size you expect to find in a vending machine. My son who is 2 1/2 loves them!
"These are perfect to have in your car, purse, bag, etc... for a quick and healthy snack for kids and adults!  When you open big bags of animal crackers, they don't always stay fresh before you get a chance to finish them.  I thought the price was terrific and will be coming back for more!"
My family really enjoyed these Animal Crackers. A great snack to take with us as we are leaving the house. I appreciate the price and would recommend to anyone.
"I bought these for an easy to grab treat for summer outings. My girls don't usually love animal crackers, but they love these!"
I eat Zoo Animal Crackers at my workplace but I cannot find a vendor in the area that sells them.  I found them on Amazon for a great price and fast shipping.  Now I have everyone eating these delicious crackers.
We got a great deal on these (10.27 for 36 count).  There were not any problems with crushed or crumbled crackers. Freshness was fine too. These are a great size for lunches or snacks to take in the car!
"I ordered these for our Children's Ministry Wednesday night snack time.  Not only do they come in pre-packaged individual bags, but they are a great allergy free snack.  The Subscribe and Save option was perfect.  Now, I don't even have to think about snack-time, since I get the boxes delivered to the church every month, right on schedule.  Saves me time and money!<br /><br />Check out the blog: Growing Kids Ministry for more Children's Ministry ideas!"
"After realizing I was buying these just about every day at works vending machine for 75 cents a pop, I figured I could save some money by buying in bulk. These make great, tasty, relatively healthy snack."
"I first purchased these crackers from Sam's. When I started looking for them locally I could not find them. So, of course I went to Amazon and found them. The brand is Austin and the taste and flavor is really good. Better than any others I have tried. So they are really worth the extra effort."
"I love these animal crackers. Much better than the other national brand I have purchased. However, as much as I love Amazon and purchase from Amazon, this is not a good price. I don't think I paid much more than half this price at SAMS. Yes, it is cheaper than a vending machine. PS - My kids like them too."
I love these I have a bag everyday nice not to pay one dollar at a time.<br />I only paid .37 cents per bag LOVE IT
"I love these animal crackers.  They're dry and minimally sweet, kind of like tea biscuits."
A great tasting treat like the old fashion animal crackers. No after taste like many brand made now. I'd rate this a very good product.
I bought a box of these at Sams Club  in October 2010 and the box said new and improved.  I really thought the flavor was disgusting.  They added a bunch more sugar and a very strong vanilla? and some other flavor.  I threw out the entire box.  I wish they would go back to the original.
This price is over double the price available elsewhere. Really bothers me when venders do this.  Buy elsewhere and force venders to price more competitively.
"I cannot eat 36 bags of the same fat and color additive in 5-10 days. They already taste stale.<br />if you want fat melt inside of your mouth, this is the product for you."
"way way too sweet, how can one eat this.<br />discarded the entire box.<br />what a waste of money.<br />will never again buy this."
We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is no more expensive & in some cases less - Prime membership is awesome.  Loving Pets treats are some of the best according to my dog.  They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.
"I looked for a long time for a healthy cat food that didnt cost a ton of money..with it being gone within a month. This cat food had a good price, 34 for a 15 pound bag..not to mention it lasts a long time, probably 2 months. The food does so well with my cats and no more diarrhea for them either. They like it, and it does very well on their tummies. I would recommend it..previously I used wellness indoor and it caused diarrhea. I dont know why the other reviewer said bad things, maybe it wasnt the food. Definitely buy:)"
"I have two cats who were barfing on a daily basis. I thought that was normal until I started talking to other people. My cats had been on Purina which I thought was a decent cat food. I started doing research and found out that was far from the truth. We switched to Natural Balance because it was the most affordable of the good cat foods available in our area. One of the cats loved it right off the bat. The other one took a week to warm up to it, but he eats it now. They've been on Natural Balance for close to 4 months and other than the occasional fur ball, there's been no puke on my carpet! They get a small scoop in the morning, and share a can of wet food in the evenings. So far I have zero complaints about this cat food. It doesn't get 5 stars simply because picky cats might take a while to warm up to it, as our picky boy did. He prefers the smelly bad for him Purina, silly boy."
"I received a bag that was labeled slightly different from the picture shown.  Mine was labeled ""Chicken Meal & Salmon Meal.""  I was not sure my cats would like it since they were used to the original flavor.  Well, as it turns out, they loved it!!"
"Can't give it five starts because I am not the end user of this product, but the cat seems to eat it, so it can't be that bad. She comes running when I put the food in the bowl if that means anything. Not like she has another choice. I wish I could be excited about eating the same thing everyday..."
Natural Balance Indoor Ultra dry cat food is a product that my cats love.  At least I guess they do because they vote with their eating behavior.  This is one of two products they will choose to eat and that doesn't make them throw up.  Of the two products this is by far the healthiest.  It even makes their poop smell okay and that is saying a lot for a cat.
"I fed my cats Natural Balance because it is good value for good quality. My vet approves it (and she have high fived me before for taking care of the cats so well: wet and dry food, not just dry food)."
"Our 2 year old cat has been eating this since we adopted her and ran out of the Science Diet we got from the shelter.  She does very well on it (no hairballs, no diarrhea, minimal vomiting, no illnesses) and it's a great value here on Amazon."
"edited 7/8/12.  So sorry for the horrible typos.<br /><br />Bought this because it was top consumer choice or something for the not cheap, but not the really expensive dry cat foods ((basically, top rated for the middle of the road priced foods)). Switched them from Purina kitten food to this. Their poop is still ""unnaturally stinky"" as my husband says. It's been a couple months too so I don't know. Their kitten food was a different brand too, so I'm not blaming food for their stankiness.  I think they're just gasy kitties.<br /><br />Just annoying that I can only find it online.  Amazon is the best price I've found so far.  Wish I could do that thing where you get a discount if you have it automatically ordered every month or so.  That would be awesome since I do buy it every month (for 2 cats. Would probably last 2 months for 1 cat)."
"Don't buy this product.  Company would like you to think it is healthy, but it isn't.  Made my cat sick, throwing up.  Now I find out it is made by Diamond Foods and is in the recall list just anounced 5/30/2012.  Diamond Foods makes alot of pet food products and has a very poor rating for safe products.  They had to shut down 3 of their plants because of contamination.  I had to throw this product away, and it cost over $30.00.  Save the money and don't buy this crap!!!"
This is my favorite Quaker hot instant organic oatmeal in the morning or anytime. I have tried other brands of organic instant oatmeals and nothing compares. It has the right texture and flavor. I have been buying this cereal faithfully for at least 4 years when I came across it at a discount store and had stocked up on it. I was happy to see Amazon was carry this product! Give this a try. You won't be disappointed because it's so good.
I am a convert! THANK YOU AMAZON for carrying this - I can not find it in my local grocery store & I am thrilled to have an Organic Oatmeal that both me and my kiddies enjoy.
The best instant oatmeal I have ever had.  It's hard to find in the stores if not impossible.  I love this stuff.
My kids love this and I am so happy to have a organic option that doesn't taste chemically or like cardboard!!  My kids always ask for this at breakfast!!  Highly recommeded for busy Mamas and families.
"From the first day my pup tried them, he loved the greenies. He takes it and goes in hiding to enjoy.  He is an 8lb. Maltese and 9 months old.  The treat will last him about 30 minutes if he chews on it until it is gone.  His breath smelled so bad before I gave him these and since then his breath is fresh and does not smell at all.  The green color from the treat does not make his fur around his face green at all. Great product! I will continue to purchase these for him.  43 to a bag and I give him one a day. So the price is right because it lasts well over a month."
"Greenies save me money at the vet. My dogs teeth stay clean so I don't have to have them done and him put under anestetic very often, once now in 5 years and with my last dog twice in 15 years. Not bad.<br /><br />They are also my ultimate bribe. If he won't come in when I want him too all I have to do is say greenie. I know, not good dog training but sometimes I do it anyway.<br /><br />They are made in the USA and my vet approves of them those are 2 very important things to me. I tried another one that I was offered a deal on and my dog got sick and almost choked on it, this doesn't happen if you buy the right size for your dog."
"I'd love to know the kind of bars the first reviewer eats; because they must be some amazing bars! My entire office loves the Nugo bars. They are actually made a few doors down the street from my office. I think the coffee bars, chocolate blast, and banana bars are the best. Peanutbutter pleasers are good as well. I recommend them. I've had many of the regular store bought brands and find these to be more chocolaty and delicious. Good luck!"
"I like the NuGo brand and the ingredients offered in their bars, but I am not wild about this flavor. Let yourself be the judge though. I really liked the peanut butter pleaser and the chocolate flavors, so I will continue to buy those two."
"I bought one of these in our hospital cafeteria, and really enjoyed it.  I've been looking for a snack bar high in protein, low in fat, that tastes good.  Not an easy feat! It really satisfies the sweet tooth I get after lunch. Coffee and chocolate - a delicious combo!"
"We bought a box of the coffee, and a box of the peanut butter barts- hoping to find a new wonderful quck bite bars to grab on the go.<br /><br />We were all disapointed in the taste, they were dry, and generally had very little flavor to them.  The one positivie aspect is that they were good sized as far as filling one up.<br /><br />I would not reccoment these bars- there are too many wonderful flavored ones in the grocery store to settle for so-so taste."
"The NuGo bars in general are very well balanced, low in sugars, low in fats, and high in protein. This bar is no exception, and it adds ""delicious"" to the description."
"I have many, many different types of protein and energy bars. Typically, they fall into one of two categories candy bars that they try to classify as ""Energy Bars"" and compressed saw dust that they classify as ""Protein bars"".<br /><br />  Nugo bars, and especially ""Banana Chocolate"", are outstanding. The Coffee Break bars contain 13 grams of protein and taste GREAT at 190 calories (2 grams of fat). I can eat one bar in the morning and have my hunger  reasonably satisfied until lunch.<br /><br /> Truth be told I prefer ""Banana Chocolate"" over the ""Coffee Break"" but these are still pretty darn good. While ""Coffee Break"" is my second favorite flavor  they still fully deserve 5 stars."
"Both flavors I bought,coffee and chocolate, have great taste, 11gm. of protein and only 180 calories. The price was right and delivery rapid."
"I've tried quite a few no-or-low sugar protein bars, and I find NuGo generally among the best.  I had decided Black Cherry was my favorite until I tried Coffee Break.  Yum."
"Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site.  I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can.  And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping.  These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online.  It has actually soured me on using Amazon."
I had a really hard time finding a somewhat affordable natural canned food for our puppy. I was having problems with him eating just his kibble so on a whim I tried a little bit of this mixed in and he LOVED IT. Ever since I've been buying in bulk on amazon..its cheapest here.
"My dog love all wellness tread  so I decide to try this canned food beside to be very nutritional (price is the cheaper on town), my dog did finish all 12, I mixed with her orijen dry food, the first cans she ate them great but seems she got bored with the last ones, that does not mean the food is not good, like I said great food but not for the taste of my dog. Anyway went ahead to try different canned food (Blue Buffalo Small Breed Canned Dog Food, Chicken Dinner Recipe)to mix with her dry food. this one seem like is of her taste. I recommended both canned food anyway."
"First and foremost, all foods won't work for every dog, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />That being said, I bought a few cans of Wellness Just For Puppy and it's been the best purchase I've made since acquiring a malnourished 6 week old puppy. She's putting weight on at a good pace and her coat is looking wonderful.<br /><br />Let's face it, all the filler and things they put into much of the pet food available is no better than us eating Big Macs every day. It's food, we'll survive on it... but it's not the best we can have.<br /><br />Wellness Just For Puppy is a much better choice than a lot of other foods, try it out, it's your choice!<br /><br />Happy eating!"
My puppy was having some tummy upsets.  Wellness products were recommended and my dog is healthy and happy.  This is really a top quality product.
"sometimes i will mix this with dry food for my puppy, the smell is good, my puppy loves eating it(although she loves every type and brand i gave her).<br />she does not have any bad reactions after eating it, though no particular good ones neither."
"This food has a lot of vitamins and our baby loves it. When I open each can it smells really good. The food is soft and easy to handle. Great, healthy choice for any puppy. The cans are small enough even for our 3lb baby so she has her food fresh all the time."
Gave to my girl pup because she was getting used to people food and wouldn't eat..I was feeding her sporadically to get her hungry and she was just losing weight... Gave this to her mixed with the puppy dry from Wellness and she went to it and ate every last piece. Good stuff a great relief.
"Wow. I just got a yorkie puppy, 10 weeks at the time of coming home. Breeder sent me home with mighty dog canned food. Worst smelling product I have encountered, my house and puppy stunk. I know dogs are not human, but a product that has that scent cannot possibly be good for the dog. I went to petco and got some supplies including wellness puppy treats. He loved them so much I decided to quickly switch to this dog food. No transition just fed it to him, he loves it, eats more, and has absolutely no problems. I am happy with the ingredient list. Highly recommend. Also when I first opened this I was pleasantly surprised to see actual pieces of vegetables in the can, plus it smelled kind of like tuna, much much better then the horrible smelling mystery paste before."
"I got a pekingnese puppy from a friend and we started feeding her science diet puppy food, we started to notice it looked like she was having some type of seizure, here legs would go in different directions and she appeared to be drunk, my husband noticed that she behaved this way after we fed her the puppy food.  I went to the store and found Wellness Puppy food, we gave it to our puppy and she did well with it.  It was a little costly so I looked for a  better price online and I have been getting it online ever since.  Our puppy is now 7 months old and is doing well."
"Great food, No bi-products and good quality food your the young pup in your life. Fast delivery, and good price for the Puppy can food from Wellness."
"Good product for good pups, even not so good pups.  Price was right, packaging was good, cans were intact, not dented, as were the turkey/sweet potato adult cans (24 of them)."
My puppy is very picky and he loves this food. I mix it with dry small-bites food and he just gobbles it up.
"We have a 5 month puppy who doesn't eat much and doesn't drink much.  We mix this with dry food and chicken and it really helps with the hydration since he won't drink too much. He's healthy, has a nice coat, and seems to like this canned dog food."
I ordered the product based on the picture and then found out that they were the smaller cans and not the bigger cans when the order arrived.  I should've been more careful but please change the picture to show the 6 ounce can.<br /><br />Thanks.
My rescue puppy loves this food and what a difference it has made in his coat and all around health.  Just a well balanced food.
"Well, when we got our dog Valentine as a Valentine's Day Surprise, the next day we rushed to PETCO and they told us that a healthy food would be Wellness and Blue. We got Blue dry food and Wellness canned food. Our dog ate Wellness for a month and a half, and them she didn't really want to eat it anymore, sniff and walk away. The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option. We ended up giving the food and treats to our neighbor and owner of Valentine's brother, and that dog will eat ANYTHING, so at least the food didn't go to waste."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ4W8"">Judy's Candy Company Caramels,Sugar-Free, 0.8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 80)</a>These caramels taste like the real (with sugar) thing. They are very chewy and tasty. They have a low carb count.They have about 80 calories per piece. As long as you don't eat more than one or two a day, they shouldn't cause a weight problem."
"I only eat sugar free candies and snacks and these are delicious.  I was leary of buying such a large quantity, but I had bought Judy's Caramels in smaller amounts and thought what the heck.<br />They are so much fresher than even the small packages and literally melt in your mouth.  The almond ones are my least favorite, but I liked them as well.<br />In a statement...simply the best sugar free caramels I've ever had and well worth the price."
These caramels are the best. They taste just like the ones with sugar in them. I especially like to eat them with peanuts because it is like a caramel apple without the apple!! They are the best if you are watching your carbs or not!!
"These sugar free caramels are 60 calories and taste just like the ""regular"" version.  They are a wonderfull product, and I will buy them again and again!"
These caramels are soft and delicious.  You would never know they are sugar-free.  Yum!
i got the variety pack and the triple threat pack.<br />loved them all...i am just reading the<br />belly fat diet book and they are recommended in<br />there as well!
"My dogs eat the Merrick canned food with Fromm dry.  They can be picky with the different flavors, not really liking the flavors that are venison or trout or buffalo, etc.  My fancy local pet store that i was buying their food at has a nice selection of Merrick wet food but never carried cheeseburger and fries.  When i saw this flavor i had to buy it and i am glad i did.  I just received my second case today and my doggies LOVE it. Other favorites of theirs are wingalings, smothered chicken, bruts and tots, campfire delight, grammy pot pie, turducken, cowboy cookout, and ballpark bonanza.  I like supporting my local independent pet store, but amazon saves me about 50 cents a can with our almost 10 percent sales tax rate, so i buy their favs here by the case and supplement at the pet store with the flavors amazon doesnt carry as well as continue to buy the fromm dry there because they are cheaper."
This flavor is definitely not up to Merrick standards.  Only one of my dogs would eat it.  Gave some to a friend.  Her dogs left it untouched.
"The first time I purchased Franny's Organic Select Raisins from a local grocery store I thought they were the best tasting raisins I had ever eaten.  I purchased them because they were organic, but to my surprise they sweet and fresh tasting.  I wouldn't purchase any other brand and when my local store quit carrying them I found them available at Amazon.com."
"These raisins are tasty!  These are so much better than those big name-brands which are usually all dried out and hard.  And they are organic, which makes me feel good about what I feed my family.  These raisins go in my kids lunches, and they love them. The small box is so convenient.  I also put them in my cycling jersey when I ride. Excellent job Franny!"
These raisins are fabulous!  They are plump and juicy and never dried out.  We've already gone through most of our bulk order within a couple of weeks.  All the kids and adults in our house can't get enough.  Thanks Franny's!
i make my own trail mix with these.carry it in my bag and keep it at home to mix in salads.
"I bought these for my 3 year old son. I, personally, am not a huge fan of raisins but I thought I'd try them before giving them to my son. This is how raisins SHOULD taste. No chemicals, no GMOs... everything that REAL food should be and you can taste the difference! They are plump and juicy and actually taste like food. They are not dried out and chewy like the ones you get from the big name brand. I feel great about providing these to my son since they have no harmful chemicals. We will never go back to a different brand again. thank you Frannys for providing an excellent product!"
"The raisins are very delicious and addicting.  I can't help myself from eating a lot of it.  I used to feel dizzy when I wake up in the morning, but no more dizziness.  I wonder if it's the vitamins in the raisins that helped me. Yummy!"
"These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.<br /><br />Only downside is that it uses vanillin, rather than real vanilla.  However, it goes great with ice cream and fruits!"
"If you love ginger or any of the other Destrooper cookies, you will like these.  They are light and crispy, not at all like a chewy ginger snap. Not too strongly spiced and with small bits of delicious candied ginger. Very good."
"These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!"
"I have been buying out the stock of these cookies at every Stop & Shop and King Kullen in my area for quite some time!! They put out 12 boxes-I buy 12 boxes-until they raised the price so much in 2 years that I sought out other methods of satisfying my addiction.<br />Amazon to the rescue!!! The subscription service is a wonderful thing-brings the price down to $2.11/box-when they are now $3.69 in my local supermarket-(if you can find them). And FREE SHIPPING!!  Finding this service was my refuge to keep these cookies in my life without going into ""cookie bankruptcy""-with  my food budget.  LOVE THEM!!"
"These cookies are wonderful.They are thin, delicate, and have a buttery, slightly cinnamom taste. There was a Potato Chip Commercial out years ago, which simpy stated "" I bet you can not eat just one... "" This reference may also be made to these cookies. They are so good!<br /><br />We purchased 2 cases, to give for a nice little Holiday Gifts. My Mother is 82, she has always baked cookies for our family, she praised them highly as well.<br /><br />For those into making Gift Baskets, these would be a nice addition.<br /><br />The price on Amazon was less than in the local Grocery Store. The Free Shipping, was also great."
These are special butter crisps and taste as close to home-made as boxed cookies can taste
"over the course of one day while at my work desk. As other reviewers noted, they are light, buttery and delicious! I'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. They are so tasty they really are fine plain. Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12, but maybe then I'd eat too many."
These cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box. They taste like real butter and fresh ingredients - And they just about melt in your mouth. I'll be buying these again!
"Wonderful, light cookie.  Very buttery; they taste like browned butter and almonds.  I am thrilled to find these at Amazon.  They cost a lot more locally and are very fragile, so bringing them from France always leaves me with a box of very delicious crumbs. These came well-packed and (mostly) whole, so they are suitable for company. 12 boxes may seem like a lot, but they go very fast. Highly recommended."
"Wow very good.  Light and crispy with a great cinnamon and ginger taste.  I'm not a fan of ginger snaps actually, but these have a much lighter and not nearly as spicy taste. Remind me a bit of a graham cracker.  You can also eat a bunch as one serving, which is always a plus.  I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care."
"This is a intensed crisp butter snap. Loads of butter flavour. My  top picks from J.D. Almond Crisp, Virtuosos and Waffles. Cookie time!"
"These cookies were recommended by the editor of Gourmet magazine in a post from her weekly emails.  She was right!!! They are to die for.  Buying a case at a time from Amazon was great also.  They arrived promptly, in great shape and we didn't have to pay any shipping as we qualified for FREE SHIPPING on our purchase.  Having these in the pantry is a great timesaver.<br /><br />They've got quite a bite to them -- possible ginger.  They are thin -- just perfect for a quick nibble or dunk.<br /><br />We just loved them!!!"
"Love it very much. Too bad this item is not on-sale anymore.<br />If there is next time, I will get a whole case!!"
"I have purchased a carton containing 12 boxes.<br /><br />At least half the boxes had a few crumbled thins in them and 2 of them had the taste of rancid butter.<br /><br />The rest were up to my expectations; but, overall I was disappointed."
"Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
"We tasted these cookies in Florida, came home and ordered a case of them, they are the best tasting, buttery crispy like waffles. but they are cookies, very thin and crispy.<br />Wished our grocery carried them."
"An elegant treat, unique in that it incorporates tiny pieces of crystallized ginger in a paper thin, crisp cookie. Absolutely the finest product of its kind."
"This is one of my favorite cookies. Light, crispy and flavorful; a great snack without too much guilt.  I order them regularly."
These are adult ginger cookies. There are actual little chunks of ginger in these very thin very crispy little wafers. They're even better dunked in tea. Careful - it's easy to eat a whole box and there aren't that many in a box. I order them by the case to make sure we don't run out.
"This a great light snack.Two of these delicious belgian waffles has 130 calories with only 50 from fat.Total fat is 6 grams and saturated fats are 3.5.So I grab a couple and pray that I can stop at two,and have coffee or tea along with them.I'm at peace!"
"Light and crisp - wonderful flavor, but not many cookies in the package. I will buy again"
"They are crisp, buttery yet light.<br /><br />Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).<br /><br />The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)<br /><br />Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-)"
"i have loved this product for years, and when I saw them on sale at Amazon, I jumped and placed an order.  It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping."
I know that product because I was raised in Belgium.<br /><br />I send Jules Destrooper to my adopted soldier and he loved the waffles more than<br />the thins.  But he nevertheless liked the thins more than expected.<br />His buddies liked them too and I doubt any package is left.<br /><br />Not everyone likes this specific taste (spekuloos is made with cinnamon)<br /><br />Personally I love Jules Destrooper tiny waffles best.  All is excellent tho.<br />highest quality.  Delacre is also excellent.  Lotus is less good. too much sugar.<br /><br />A favourite brand that develops taste without making you feel saturated with fat.
These snacks are so delicious! Sadly during the shipping there was minimal cracking of the small crackers. Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain; it may be for some who serve it with a parfait and want excellent presentation or something like that. But that was just my experience. Will be purchasing more most likely when we run out.
"All of the Jules Destrooper cookies are made in Belgium with good quality ingredients and packaged well.  They are quite attractive and whenever I serve them to someone who has never had them before, they always comment on them.<br /><br />The thins are especially elegant, thin and crisp, wonderful with ice cream or a warm beverage.  My only complaint about Jules Destrooper cookies is that it is very difficult not to eat a whole box at once.  Whenever I see them at the dollar store, I stock up and try to hide a few boxes in the top cabinet.<br /><br />Ginger Thins - These have plenty of nice chewy little bits of translucent candied ginger (5%) that contrast with the almost brittle cookie and have a good balance of spice (ginger and a hint of cinnamon) to sweet.  These are wonderful with tea.<br /><br />Almond Thins - Crispy with lots of almond slivers and slices (10%) and a pronounced flavor of both brown sugar and butter.  I appreciate that they aren't loaded up with almond extract, making the taste more delicate in than the usual almond cookie.  Especially good with ice cream, cr&egrave;me brûl&eacute;e, or any custard-based dessert.<br /><br />Butter Crisps - These are also nice and crunchy but with a more neutral flavor, very buttery, similar to an ice cream cone.  They are excellent with a thin smear of jam and hot chocolate or with ice cream.<br /><br />Paris Butter Waffles - These are not quite as brittle or elegant as the others but because of the deep waffle pattern, they are the perfect vehicle for hazelnut chocolate spread (Nutella) or speculoos spread (Biscoff spread) and a cup of coffee.  This variety does have artificial vanilla, which is actually preferred by many for baking cookies."
"These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.  When the last crumb had vanished, I searched for more on Amazon and, sure enough, my favorite shopping spot came through.  This crunchy, buttery waffle cookie is a terrific addition to a bowl of Blue Bell (yes, I'm a loyal Texan) ice cream or a good cup of tea or coffee. We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal.  You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat.  The only thing I would change is the packaging.  Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases.  Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole. Bon apetit!"
The product is great.  I prefer this over all your other products.  Very tasty.  Not much more to say.  I would buy it again.
"The cookiea arrived on time, and were exactly as advertised.  They were delicious.  I will buy more of these cookies from this vendor as and when I need them."
My mother and I ate some butter crisp similar to this product. I never heard of this company before so I went ahead and tried it.. They are amazing!! I am ordering them again! These will be my stocking stuffer this year
Slightly expensive biscuits but Kids love them because they are really sweet.  The adults love them too! Very fresh and crispy.
"The order arrived very quickly, no broken cookies and I'm so pleased. These are my aunt's favorites (and mine too), so we are both loving this. I'm so glad I found these on Amazon.com because they are so pricey in the store!"
"I thought I liked s'mores before I tried making them with these cookies. If you haven't already tried them you need to, so good!"
"These butter waffles are good on their own, but much better with fruit or iced cream. IMO"
"A buttery, crisp, not terribly sweet, crunchy delight. Either alone, or accompanied by iced or hot tea and/or a bowl of Sharon's All Berry Sherbet or Sorbet."
"I can't buy these too often - they are an addiction!  Absolutely wonderful with a companion scoop of ice cream, or just plain with glass of milk.  I love making them a part of gift baskets - for housewarming or hostess gifts.  Almost always get asked where I got them."
"If you enjoy a delicate flavor, a crunchy bite, and superb taste, Jules Destrooper cookies will be your choice.  My favorite are the ""butter crisps"", second favorite, ""almond thins"".  Haven't tasted any others but if they are representative, the rest must be incredible!  Butter Crisp Cookies are absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />Difficult to find in local stores where I live so have to order on line now.  Received quickly from Amazon.com.  100% satisfied with service and especially the product! Try 'em, you'll LOVE 'em."
"The best ever, you can't stop eating them. No wonder the King of Belgium likes these cookies also."
"These cookies are the best store bought cookies I have ever eaten.  I usually prefer my own cookies, but this product is superb!  Fine enough for elegant dining situations."
"I added these to our adult children's Easter baskets.<br />They truly enjoyed them. The taste is light, crisp, and totally delicious.<br />I plan on using the rest at a tea party and as hostess gifts. :)"
"Excellent cookie; light, buttery, not too sweet and oh so easy to eat at least half a box at a time. Maybe some one else can make a cookie as great as these, but no one can ever make a cookie any better, because these cookies are the best! Try them and I'm sure you will agree."
"Wonderful flavor and crunch. I especially enjoy them with my tea. The ingredients are natural, and since I don't remember seeing the ingredient list with the product information I'll give it here: wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, almonds(10%), salt, leavening:sodium bicarbonate. I use to buy these at my grocery, but only if they were on sale. Amazon's price beats the sale price, so Amazon is a very good bargain. Knowing how thin the cookie is I was concerned about the shipping breaking the cookies, but frankly the product shipped from Amazon was in better condition than the grocery version. These truly are wonderful, but beware that once you've opened a box it's very hard to stop at a single serving (8 cookies). There are about 30 cookies per box, and I confess, I've eaten an entire box in a day. If you like the flavor combination of brown sugar, butter, and almonds then you will really like these cookies."
These are SO GOOD.  One box at a time does not seem like enough.  Try them; you'll love them.
"The taste is great but the price is little high for the quantity. The biscuits taste real good, but the size is thing and quantity is less. If you can effort, these are great tasting cookies."
"Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps go great with thick Dalmatian-style fig spread and some salty cheese.  Or jam one right into a scoop of your favorite quality ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a great price, and there is no substitute cookie for this flavor."
I originally found these cookies at Adams fairacre Farms in NY. They are a bit pricey so I decided to search for them and found them here at Amazon. the Price was great fast delivery and Yes I would purchase this item again.
"If you haven't tried these cookies with a glass of milk, you haven't lived!  I bought them in a small grocery in Washington, DC while I was there on business.  I saved the wrapper, googled them and then bought them through Amazon.  Quick service, product was fresh and now I am happy.  Caution, they are addicting so only let yourself have one or two at a time - not the whole box."
"From where I should start! From the amazing taste, the nice smell or the natural ingredients. Do you know? try it and tell me your opinion."
"Only thing I can say is that this is my favorite cookie in the world, period.<br /><br />And I hate amazon! they ship 2 cases to me every two weeks at such a wonderful price. So they are so readily available whenever I crave for one and I finish two boxes in one serving with no guilt..."
I love these cookies. They are delicate and taste wonderful. Great with ice cream or pudding. Of course alone they are just as wonderful. These are geared more to the adult taste.
I'm going to echo the general concensus and say these are awesome.  Perfect texture without being terribly heavy and overly sweet like a big ol' chocolate chip cookie might be.
I really love these wafer cookies.  Why can't I get them directly from [...] with my regular orders from them?<br />Wouldn't that be less expensive for you and for me and for the environment?
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!<br /><br />After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my ""butter waffles"" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to ""make its own stuffing."" I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.<br /><br />Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the ""Davenports,"" have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a ""heck of a time,"" under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on ""high alert"" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!!"
"From where I should start! From the amazing taste, or the natural ingredients. Do you know? try it and tell me your opinion."
They are way too rich and sweet for me. They are not healthy. It is ok to eat them once in a while.
"From where I should start! From the amazing taste, the nice smell or the natural ingredients. Do you know? try it and tell me your opinion."
"The package was not delivered up to this day. When I phoned USPS a few weeks ago, they told me the package was delivered, yet I received nothing. I ordered two other Jules Destrooper products which were shipped via UPS, and I got them fine, so I do not think it's a problem with amazon. Still, up to this day I have not received the package, and there is no where to complain about it since no one wants to take the responsibility!!"
"I am always on the look out for soy free food and when I found this at my grocery store I literally screamed with excitement.  Truthfully these aren't as good as saltine crackers, but hey, they're made with better ingredients and soy free.  I ordered these from amazon and I'm very disappointed with how they held up in shipping.  I generally end up with about 15 whole crackers and the rest ranges from 3/4 of the cracker to a crumb per box.  I can't recommend getting these delivered to your door unless your area doesn't have them stocked at the grocery store."
"I went looking for a saltine cracker specifically because the typical commercial brands are very salty, and they contain nitrates.  My hands, fingers, and toes tighten and swell when I eat them.<br /><br />I found these outstanding saltines in the Green-Wise section of the Publix for $2.49 per 6 oz. box.  They are certified organic by the USDA.<br /><br />The crackers contain organic wheat flour, organic palm oil, organic oleic safflower oil & sea salt, organic evaporated cane juice, leavening (baking soda, cream of tartar), yeast, & enzymes.<br /><br />Just like the label says, they are crispy, old-fashioned soda crackers with no synthetic pesticides, or artificial ingredients.  The packing is so unassuming, but the product is superior.<br /><br />The flavor is just like saltines I enjoyed as a child.  I love to eat them with cheese & homemade salmon spread.  I cannot wait to try their other products.<br /><br />I rate these crackers 5/5 for taste, texture, size, freshness, & appearance, and I rate them 5/5 for cost and affordability.<br /><br />Each 6 oz. box contains 12 (4 crackers) servings, 2.5 g fat per serving, 120 mg sodium, 10 g carbs, 0 g sugar, 1 protein, & 60 cal. per serving.<br /><br />They are so delicious and wholesome, you'll have trouble putting them down--so don't eat out of the box.  Get a saucer instead or you'll go through the box without realizing it--all gone."
"These crackers are buttery without leaving that greasy mouthfeel.  They seem more like Ritz than saltines, but I was expecting that from reading the other reviews.<br /><br />They are packaged loose in boxes (not in rows), but I didn't have any problems with excessive cracker crumbling during shipping.  Most of the crackers in each box are whole with a normal amount of crumbs at the bottom of the box (similar to what I'd expect if I picked them up in the store).<br /><br />I just wish I could order a half case!"
Almost as rich as Ritz crackers but without so much of the bad stuff. I have been going through oodles of them this Summer!
"The crackers are very crisp and not very salty. Our family eat it with soup, with peanut butter or just as it is."
These are the best saltines ever! We use them in everything and put everything on them. I buy them locally for 1.89-2.50 a box and usually stock up when 1.89 a box. Their other items are great too. Very low allegiant even when made near others it still doesn't effect mine. So it shows you how well made and clean they are. Plus organic.<br /><br />I want to say they are also iodine salt free and kosher friendly? Cant find info to confirm it. But check a box at the local market I think they are.
I love these crackers. It's almost as if a Saltine and a Ritz got together. They are crisp and buttery. I'm sitting here now finishing off a box as a snack. Even plain they are just yummy.
"These are quite delicious and even a bit like a ""Ritz"" cracker as they have a buttery flavor and slightly firmer texture than a 'normal' saltine. We will definitely buy these again."
"Everyone in our household loves these great vegan crackers that meet our allergy needs.  I wish Late July would make a whole wheat cracker, too."
"This was great. I haven't been able to find it anywhere, not even on the Tom Douglas website. Fantastic."
"I have been a big believer in Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar with Mother for acid reflux.  While ordering more vinegar I decided to try a bottle of their Olive Oil and it is very good and at a very good price for organic Olive Oil.  The packing was amazing, I think you could have dropped the box off the top of a building and the bottle would be protected.  It took me quite awhile to get the tons of bubble wrap off the bottle.  But then again, it's a good thing, you don't want a broken bottle of Olive Oil."
"I use this to make great tasting homemade tortillas. Simply add some hot water to it and a little salt and leave it sit for an hour covered after mixing. Roll into 2 inch balls and then use a tortilla press (or rolling pin if you are brave and patient) and voile, you have gluten free tortillas ready to hit the hot skillet. I've also been making baked ""chips"" by cutting a tortilla in 8 and baking it at 450 for 6 - 8 minutes. This is a great solution if you are looking for no oil corn chips but cannot find them."
"I purchased Bob's Red Mill Golden Masa a few months ago, but I have been using it often since then.  I made a ton of tamales for Christmas and New Years and they turned out unbelievable.  The corn taste is awesome.  I also made corn tortillas with it for the first time and they turned out perfect.  The recipe on the bag for the corn tortillas works so well.  Just remember to let the dough set covered for at least an hour before using.  Also, it helps to add a little bit of baking soda for some lift."
"I am a BBQ chip fanatic and have tried every chip in almost every state. These are in the top ten, crisp, real potato flavor, taste home-made. The only suggestion is they could add a little more of the bbq flavoring, that would move them up to the top 5 category and at this price they can't be beat. Thank you Route 11..for your little slice of heaven"
"I found this chai tea four years ago and have been a loyal consumer since.  The taste is second to none.  In fact, I add a few cardamom seeds and the great taste is even greater!"
"Mystic Chai is my favorite hot drink ever. I have tried lots of chai tea's, bags and powdered and this one beats them all. I will keep buying this product a case at a time forever. I just wish it was carried at Sams Club still."
"This is the blueberry syrup they use at the Four Seasons Maui to make their famous blueberry mojitos. It is so good mixed with blueberry vodka, lime juice, club soda, and mashed fresh blueberries! Lots of sugar in it but heck you only live once."
Made a better pancake syrup than drink syrup.<br />The drink did not have a strong flavor and was more<br />like weak sugar water when mixed.
"I am not familiar with Roganjosh; I bought this spice because it was less expensive than the Curry powder of the same brand (both featured in Amazon's Add-on program) and the ingredients sounded similar.  It arrived cocooned in so many layers of bubble wrap that I couldn't even see the spice bottle.  All that bubble wrap must have been for show though, because the plastic cap on the bottle was cracked wide open AND there was no safety seal.  I threw it out."
"Yet another form of the ""generic"" Rogan Josh spice! you end up with something you would find at a Punjabi restaurant which is supposed to pass for Rogan Josh! NOT the real thing...crap! Try to find the authentic deggi Mirch if you want the real thing..."
"The package shows fresh berries so you might assmume these are made from dried berries and chocolate.  The ingredients say something very different.... fruit juice concentrate boiled up w corn syrup and cane sugar, thickened and covered w choc.  Sugar - sugar and more sugar.  Buyer beware."
"Notice it doesnt say Acai BERRIES?<br /><br />That's because the interior of the candies are actually just a berry flavored gelatin - like the inside of a jelly bean. So these are just chocolate covered jellybeans, not real chocolate covered berries. Ingredients are fruit juice and fructose. Frankly it tastes like the main flavoring ingredient is sugar and cheap grape/apple juice to me. You cant even taste Acai.<br /><br />This product is intentionally trying to ride the healthy berries and chocolate bandwagon.<br />Yet it is full of unhealthy ingredients unlike what it label shows.<br />So this is NOT a healthy snack like they are trying to portray.<br /><br />If chocolate jelly beans are what you want thats fine, just be aware that the label is very misleading IMHO."
"The bag describes these as ""Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry"".  So, I bought these thinking I was getting a dried acai berry or blueberry covered with dark chocolate.  After a closer reading of the front of the bag as well as the ingredient list, the thing that is covered with chocolate is described as a ""fruit juice piece"".  The ingredient list names several fruit juice concentrates in addition to acai and blueberry.  I've heard of ""dried fruit pieces"" and I've heard of ""fruit juice"", but what is a ""fruit juice piece""?  I didn't know you could have a piece of juice!  It seems like all of Brookside's products contain the mystery ""fruit juice pieces"".  What exactly is covered with dark chocolate?"
"Don't let the ""acai with blueberry"" fool you in to thinking this is a healthy snack (other than the anti oxidants you can get with any other good dark chocolate.  This is essentially a chocolate covered fruit snack...but it IS delicious!!!"
"These are so delicious.  I can't get enough of them.  It's important to note it is not dried fruit covered in dark chocolate, but flavored gelatin.  Basically, a blueberry jellybean covered in dark chocolate.  The packaging makes them appear to be a healthy snack, but they are not.  If you can get past that, definitely buy.  I know I will be."
"I just bought these thinking they would be healthly like the ones from Trader Joe's. I was wrong. I am returning them to costco and going back and getting the healthy kind!!! Too bad I can;t give them O stars. They are tasty, but misleading!!!"
"My husband got these for me for Christmas because I asked for chocolate covered blueberries from a local chocolatier.  I was a bit hesitant that these would be as good as the local candy store, but they are very good.  I don't really know what acai tastes like, but with the blueberry and acai flavors together it gives a sweet-tart taste wrapped in dark chocolate.  These are very delicious.  I'm not giving up the the chocolate covered blueberries locally, but these are definitely worth trying and I would purchase these again."
"This company has managed to take several healthy ingredients and overwhelm all possible health and taste advantage by creating a confection that is essentially white sugar, corn syrup, fat and oil. The packaging is misleading, It is not whole fruit with dark chocolate. It is a hardened jelly of fruit juices and additives with a processed milk chocolate covering that is dark in appearance. Shameful actually."
"I've got this product through AMAZON before and it was fine/delicious, but recently it came in bad shape. All the choc covered berries were stuck together in a giant clump and the chocolate appearance was stale or otherwise off. Couldn't pour it in a bowl to serve guests, it was a like a rock and the pieces could not be broken off without a big mess. Not sure if the problem was packaging/heat during shipment, or just stale product."
"If you have the will power to eat just a couple of these little nuggets a day, you'll love them. Here are the Nutrition Facts:<br /><br />7 g of fat, 5 mg cholesterol, 50 mg sodium, 29 g charbs, 1 g fiber, 25 g SUGAR, 1 g protein (1/4 cup)"
"These things are so good! They're sweet and a little tangy, and you can still feel good about eating them since they're full of antioxidants! 1/4 cup is 180 calories if I remember correctly, but sometimes it's hard to stop! They hit the spot when you need some chocolate and I recommend these if you like dark chocolate. The pomegranate ones are also delicious."
A great way to get your everyday requirement of dark chocolate and blueberries.  Just watch your portion size or the bag will be gone too soon.
"I will not purchase this product again.  Although they are delicious, they are not made with real blueberries or fruit of any kind.  The packaging is extremely misleading, showing beautiful blueberry fruit.  It makes you think you are getting an actualy chocolate covered fruit, when in reality you are getting a bag full of chemicals you can't even pronounce.  This product is extremely overpriced for the amount you get and the fakeness of the product.  Big thumbs down."
"What could possibly be better in the whole food world then taking chocolate and fruit and paring them together? I'll tell you! Nothing! I bought a bag of BROOKSIDE DARK CHOCOLATE ACAI BLUEBERRY at my neighborhood COSCO for the excellent price of $9.59. My family and I gobbled them down as fast as we could and went back for more! Go get some and you can too! Check your own store in-person or on-line for prices and availability. This is a delicious product!<br />True they do not have blueberry's inside them. Uh...so what? Hopefully you won't make a meal of them. Think snack. Put them on ice cream, in pancakes, in a trail mix or eat them plain. Think, outside-the-box or bag in this case! These little treasures are fun to eat, taste good and are good for you! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039OVW74"">Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry 2 Pounds Resealable Bag [Misc.</a>] are great! Highly recommended! Enjoy!"
"Except for the cost, these are perfect in every way...during the holidays I buy them at Costco, but as a treat I order them for relatives or guests as special treats."
"Very very surprised, as this was delivered through USPS and there was no damaged. It was packaged very well though - bubble wrapped and then boxed. Box stated ""heat sensitive"" and it was not melted at all. I will surely reorder again!! We just started to consume this brand of chocolate and I must say we can't get enough of it. Thank you all the way from Guam! :)"
"I originally got these as a gift, but my mom liked them so much that I ordered her some of her own.  We love these as a good choco snack."
"I have received and used this product several times in the past few months and love the taste. This order arrived with part of the product melted and re-solidified. I was at home when the product arrived. It was on my porch no longer than a minute or so. It was not melted when I opened it shortly after I retrieved it, but had melted and re-solidified sometime before arrival. Many of the pieces had melted and were stuck together. The product looks OK, except for the melted pieces, but the taste of the melted pieces is somewhat suspect. Amazon was kind enough to credit my account for the purchase."
"These are the most delicious snacks I have had in quite awhile. The first time I have ever had them was when I located them in one of the stores I shop. When I went to get some more, they did not have any, so I decided to go on Amazon and I was so thrilled to see them there! If you have not tried them, then please do! You will glad to have found them! They are most nutritious and delicious at the same time! Jan Hughes"
"I just can't resist stuff like this. Not only is it delicious, but it offers certain health benefits. It's Brookside Dark Chocolate with Acai Blueberry centers. Mmmmm. Are these good? Careful, you'll overdose. The chocolate is excellent. The center is made out of concentrated juices of blueberries and other fruits. Nice combination! I picked up my 2 pound bag at Costco, but I see they're available online too. I also picked up a bag os Brookside Dark Chocolate with Pomegranate centers, but I like the Blueberry best by a slight margin. Nice Candy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
SAMs club is best buy . They are very good 180 Calories for apx 23 pices 4g saturated fats sugars 25 g
"Obviously these are not a health food, but a wonderful treat with pure, lucious, dark chocolate covering real fruit juice pieces.  Because of their sugar content, they must be eaten in limited amounts.  Also, since they are formed like a medium- sized marble, they need to be kept away from small children who might choke on them. I love to serve them to company and they always get rave reviews, though I really like to keep most of them for my husband and myself and I have to hide them from my daughter and daughter-in-law.  Yum! Yum!"
"i love this chocolate! and it's very hard to find at stores. 2nd time ordering it from chichitec, amazing service. very, veryy fast. i literally ordered it like a couple days ago. and the expiration date is always 2 years away from purchase, definitely purchasing again and again x]"
The taste is okay but I think it would be much better if there was more fruit in it.<br /><br />2 pounds is an awful temptation also.  I ended up giving these away because I felt guilty about the calories but the product is okay if you consider it candy and not a health supplement.
"Whatever these are (real fruit or not / healthy or not), they are DE-licious!  I know everyone has different tastes, but I personally think the berry and chocolate flavors compliment each other perfectly.  I can't stay out of them.  I also purchase them from my local bulk warehouse store for much less, but it's good to know that I can get them on-line too.  Yum-O!"
"Soooo yummy.  We bought in COSCO and loved them but didn't think we could get any more so we found and ordered them through Amazon.  They cost a little more here than at cosco, but they are so worth it."
"Brookside Dark Chocolate Acai with Blueberry is the best dark chocolate that I have ever enjoyed.  Somehow the fruit flavors enhance the dark chocolate flavor and the center filling has just enough, but not too much sugar. Portion control is easy. I allow myself one handful every day and the flavor is so intense that this is enough to satisfy my lifelong chocolate craving.<br /><br />Even people who tell me they don't like chocolate like this product."
These blueberry-chocolate nubbins are astonishingly good as to taste and texture.  The dark chocolate [full of tryptophans] and fresh-tasting chewy berry centers are satisfying for anyone who needs a fix but doesn't want to get into too much fat.  Highly recommend for those on some diet restrictions and want to get some serious good out of what is basically a magical treat.
looked forward to receiving the product as we had previously gotten the brookside dark chocolate Acai Blueberry and loved them however this bag was not nearly as fresh and was abit dissappointed.
"I first purchased these at Costco but since I don't always see them there, I jumped at the chance to order them when I saw them on Amazon.  If you're not a big dark chocolate fan, I still recommend them because the chocolate is pretty mellow, not bitter like some dark chocolates.  I love the taste of these and I almost feel like the calories are canceled out because of all the good things acai, blueberries, and dark chocolate do for you!  I'll be buying more!"
"I would put these on automatic re-order if I could - they are hard to stop eating.  But they are not a ""health"" food, it is a candy."
"Some people have complained that it wasn't what they thought and that the bag was misleading.  But all I can say is that we can't stop eating them at our house!  They are sooo good!  If you just want a yummy treat and aren't worried that they aren't dried pieces of dead berries inside, then you found the right thing. Yes, much sugar...but worth it. haha  They are worth every penny."
I bought these for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved them! The bag was empty within a week and he was asking for more! Next year sweetheart lol (though I might order a bag for myself...they are that good!)
The acai berry and dark chocolate just don't seem to mix well.  The dark chocolate pomegranate is much better.
I like these...very addictive tho.  Just bought the EXACT same bag at CostCo for half the price....<br /><br />Opened and tried them and went back in and bought 2 more bags!!
"I picked these up recently and the are amazing.  I like sweet stuff in the afternoon and rather than grabbing a couple of handfuls of junk candy, these are amzingly healthy. Dark chocolate. No added junk. Berry flavors. Excellent. And best of all, a little /4 cup of them beats the 3 and 4 handfuls of M&M's I would usually eat.<br /><br />The only comment other than that is that I picked them up for a considerable amount less at Costco than here at Amazon."
"why am i not surprised to find an opportunistic company on the health bandwagon; I was wondering why a purported 'healthy' food item could be sold at costco, the capitalists' dream superstore!<br />god i'm sick of dishonesty i find everywhere. No wonder we are a failing 'wealthy' society. Health, trust and integrity? all OUT the window..."
very sweet.  A few hours after eating these I am releasing methane like crazy.  Had this happen with another chocolate that used some type of imitation sugar.
"These may not have the 'berry' inside of them, but the fruit juice concentrate at the centers instead of a sugary candy is so much better.  These things are delicious and really cut the chocolate craving.  I get both the acai/blueberry and the pomegranate and take about 6 of each...I'm done with chocolate for the day - on an average day.  I feel better that they are more healthful than many other chocolate covered candies.  Yes it would be great if these were real berries instead of a jelly, but that doesn't mean they aren't a perfect treat.  You have to be a little sinful to really make it a treat anyhow don't you!  The price is great too.  Just wish the site that offered the better price would also offer amazonprime shipping."
"OMG these are so freakin' delicious.  I don't even like blueberries all that much, but these are so delicious.  Think dark-chocolate covered blueberries.  Om nom nom!  My wife and I can't get enough of 'em."
I found a small bag at the drug store and absolutely loved them! I am not a dark chocolate lover but these are fantastic! So glad I found the 2Pnd bag!!
My step-daughter brought these chocolates along when she visited me in TX from CA & I immediately fell in love with them. There is just enough of a balance of Blueberry flavor & dark chocolate flavor to satisfy the palate. I will be giving these out for Christmas & other occasions to my favorite people.
These candies are so good they have earned status as a staple in our house! Offer them to guests and watch their eyes light up! They are a surprisingly delicious guilt-free treat. Also well-packaged for travel.
"Delicious as always, but my last order arrived in a very soft state unfortunately.  After refrigeration, they taste fine but they look not so fine."
I sent this to someone as a gift and the contents were melted and clumped together. The package was not sitting outside. Please improve your packaging.
Absolutely love this item. I have ordered them twice now and will make them part of my regular order from now on. They are just the right amount of sweetness for a quick after meal treat or anytime you are craving something sweet.
"The dark chocolate ""berries"" sold by Brookside are not real berries just berry juices covered in dark chocolate, this is true. They are VERY tasty but if you are looking for something healthy just buy REAL dried pomegranates or blueberries and eat them with some dark chocolate.....tastes pretty much the same and MUCH, MUCH cheaper!"
"Usually I make my own stir fry sauce but one evening for the sake of ease I decided to get this. Oh, my... God... Big. Mistake. First off, let me say that this sauce isn't necessarily bad tasting. It's just that the flavor is too overpowering, like Kikkoman overdid it on the soy and vinegar. As soon as you taste it, you're going to be knocked back by an overwhelming sensation of tanginess and fermented soy. Because the sauce was so strong, I double-checked the instructions to make sure if I wasn't supposed to add water or something else extra to dilute it. But nope, you're supposed to pour it straight onto your meal when it's almost finished cooking.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that my meal was completely ruined by this sauce but that it took some effort to get through because of the overpowering ""tangy"" taste and the unusual flavor. (Although for Asian-style meals, it doesn't really taste like any flavor you've ever encountered in Asian stir-fry). Because I don't like to throw out food, I'm going to try to make do with the half a bottle of this sauce I have left by adding a little sugar to neutralize the tanginess. Once I do that, that's it-- I'm done with this sauce. I definitely will not be buying it again or recommending it to anyone. If you're tempted to buy it, though, I suggest having additional ingredients handy to dilute its overpowering flavor, especially sugar if you also find it a little too tangy."
The people we sent these to liked them but did not rave about them. So we are concluding that it is best to stick with the cashews
"Blanched, whole, salted almonds are almost impossible to find.  These nuts are terrific! As a diabetic, I am always looking for low carbohydrate yet satisfying snacks.  A handful of these nuts is just the ticket for a pick-me-up. At the cost of about a dollar a serving, I consider them a great deal.  Will buy again..and again....."
"I have tried many syrups and Teisseire is definitely the best ever. Some other brands can have a great color to attract customers, but they have no taste even with a lot of syrup and just a little water. Not gonna happen with teisseire. I have never thought I would be soo much into a syrup, but here it is, I love this syrup and I am not trying other brands anymore (was always disappointed).<br /><br />Works also great in replacing water by milk .. mhhhhh :D"
"This is definitely the best mainstream syrup in existence today. The brand is awesome, makes great products and they always taste like the fruits unlike so many american made products which taste like chemicals..."
The flavor of this stuff is better than any other grenadine I've ever had. Just a few drops into some ice water and it changes the taste so significantly it's delicious. Well worth the money. Unlike other Grenadines that just make the water taste like it's slightly sweet and essentially garbage this one actually has flavor. I pour in just enough for it to be a very light pink and it's amazing.
"We like to put this in our lemonade, water, our cocktails and even beer. It's a French Tradition!"
"Mixed with ice water, this has a great taste.  For those of you having grown up in Europe, the taste will bring back memories."
So glad I can finally order my favorite childhood drink in the US instead of filling my suitcase with it when travelling back from Europe!!!
"Just like I remember from ye olde times: freakin delicious.<br />Only one catch: it. Goes. Too fast.<br />If you ever loved this as a kid, tryit again for the first time."
"real grenadine syrup ! Just jump on it !!<br />The exact same as you can find in France, which is impossible to find here ..."
"Yes, this tea is expensive, but it's defiantly worth buying.  I have tried a variety of teas, but this one beats them all.  This is one of the few teas that has an almost drugging effect to it, leaving you with that rare infamous 'tea buzz' that is occasionally talked about.  It's mellowing qualities are great for taking a step back out of the bustle of life and enjoying the moment.  It's flavor is extraordinary, and is in a class of it's own.  I highly recommend this tea, even if it costs you a couple extra bucks."
"Generation is the only American distributor that offers this fine tea. (Very similar to the more common Fujian province Silver Needle; with a very unique taste and aroma, kind of smooth and nutty and less astringent.) It's grown I believe near the Fujian area on the Junshan mountain which is prestigious in the tea world and has been known for centuries for tea they produce there: that the Emperors themselves have hailed as great.<br /><br />I've been reading about it all over from the Wikipedia to anywhere else I could find out about it online. I received a sample of it from the very gracious people over at Generation when I inquired about it ordering my first order of gourmet loose leaf white tea. I immediately fell in love with yellow tea and Generation, but being new to the world of ordering loose leaf teas online (or anywhere else for that matter) I've tried to find it somewhere else to have something to compare it to. I've looked all over for it and Generation is the only place I can find it in the US.<br />This is a great tea and for any fans of white tea it's definitely a tea I would recommend trying."
"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]"
"After reading the review about the change of ingredients, I contacted Holistic Select to double check the information and they clearly state that there are no pork products in this food. The only change they made was to add canola oil as a secondary fat source. Here is the list of ingredients that they sent to me:<br /><br />Anchovy, Sardine & Salmon Meal, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Canola Oil (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Dried Beet Pulp, Menhaden Fish Oil, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus ni  ger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TSQ6G"">Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Anchovy, Sardine, and Salmon Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a>"
"Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track."
"Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED"" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep."
"To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your ""wrathful"" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs."
"Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like ""chicken"" or ""chicken meal"" and  you do not want things like ""meat byproduct.""  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the ""Holistic""label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become."
"Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is ""bulkier,"" too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change."
"My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!"
"I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?"
This food is the best.  Our golden retriever who is prone to all sorts of allergies is scratch free with this food.  Thanks Amazon for making it so easy to order online.
"I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped."
"I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from ""itchy butt"" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too."
"Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars."
"I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake."
My dogs absolutely love this dog food. According to my vet this is one of the best brands and selections you can get. I will keep buying this dog food over anything else.
"My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or ""like"" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU"">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards."
A premium holistic dog food.  My last two dogs lived to be 18-19 years of age.  Amazon makes it easy for us to locate a supplier of this food.
"Super picky poodle... doesn't eat dog food (folks say if you don't give them anything else they will eat what you give them, not true in this case, tried...) &lt;shrug> he loves this food... He eats it on a daily basis - which is great as he was a rescue who previously had human food and I battled the food issue for years before finding this.  Great product!"
"We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line.  It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why.  Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home.  The product is priced right and shipped super fast.  Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online."
"After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select.  Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food.  And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type."
"Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and ""prescription"" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />""Eagle Pack"" was prior brand name before it changed over to ""Holistic Select"" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe."
Best dog food out there!  Good ingredients and my dog loves it.  We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
"My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing."
I have been buying this dog food for more than three years. It has been the best for both of my dogs. They seem to thrive since the first time they consumed it.
holistic select is extremely healthy for your dog. it is extremely healthy and recommended by vets.<br /><br />my dog is strong and healthy because of the food he eats
"My bichon has been eating this product since day 1. He's 5 now and loves it. This keeps his skin healthy and he rarely get's into chewing or allergy fits. With other products, we had allergy problems. I like the fish oil content in this and buying it online is EXTREMELY convenient that trying to carry it out of the store."
"I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs.  He loves it and, in my view, it is a very healthy dog formula. I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein.  My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select. I rate this product 5 stars."
"We have been feeding our three dogs Eagle Pack Holistic for almost eight years.  I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.  You can sign up on their website to receive monthly coupons.  My dogs have amazing coats, amazing teeth, and amazing energy.  I don't think that there is a better food that could be recommended."
"I can't stress enough how great this dog food is. My lab LOVES it! And his coat, eyes, and overall good health proves what a great quality food Holistic Select is. Ordering it from Amazon makes it so easy! It's delivered right to my door (No more heavy lifting) and the price is cheaper than most pet stores."
My dogs love this food.  We live in a rural area and Amazon makes it so easy to buy now.  Thanks Amazon!!
"We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16"" thick and 3/8"" or so in diameter. They vary some."
"I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."
This is the only dog food we trust to feed with.  It is somewhat difficult to find so when I found it on Amazon with such a great shipping rate it was a no-brainer.
"Papillon doggies love this food. Obviously great flavor, super ingredients, and a smaller kibble."
We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.
"We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb."
My dogs hate it... I dont know if its just the flavor because my dogs dont even eat tuna fish. I am going to try the chicken next...
"My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from."
We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.
"Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food. I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it doesn't get any moisture. It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food."
"Was expecting more with the high price but my dog barely touched this, and when he did eat it he would have food allergies"
"I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from ""chronic"" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!"
"I have purchased the small sized bag of Holistic Select for many years.  My cockapoo really likes this food but his Mom likes the quality ingredients in it.  From whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and probiotics this keeps my dog healthy."
First I love this food. My pup has food allergies and she has gone through many top foods because of it. This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)
"Our dogs have been on Holistic Select for 3 years now, and we are very happy with it.  The ingredients are well balanced, natural and healthy.  Our dogs have shown a marked improvement in overall health, coat, energy and weight since switching to Holistic Select from a mainstream dog food three years ago.  Plus, they love it!"
I like this a lot for my 12 y/o cardigan welsh corgi.  She needed a little more protein in her diet and I've added this to the Solid Gold Holistiquez and it's working well.
Amazon was very timely in getting the product to us despite the weather.  My dogs loved the food
"I had a sample size pack of three Eagle Pack varieties. (Lamb, fish, and duck.) Last night, my super-picky Aussie mix suddenly decided this fish variety was as good as some of her higher end training treats. I'm not sure how long the novelty will last, but I'm always excited when I find a kibble that works as a treat at class."
"I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years.  Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon.  I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick.  I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better.  I ran out of the 2nd bag  so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand."
"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?"
"We tried this jambalaya seasoning mix instead of getting the Zatarain's mixes that we usually get that include the rice. It made a great meal for us with plenty of leftovers and it was a big hit with our little family.<br /><br />If you were adding extra veggies to the Zatarain mix, using this mix won't really increase your up-front prep time. We added a bell pepper, a large onion and two celery sticks.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to simmer (for about 45 minutes) to get the best results but that is just 'waiting' time if one plans ahead. From start to finish, it took us about an hour to prepare this meal.<br /><br />I scanned and uploaded extra images of the package to the product image area. The rear of the package shows the instructions/recipe as well as a list of ingredients needed to make the recipe."
"The package in the store looks a little different than the one in the Amazon picture. So I hope it's printed on this package.<br /><br />The recipe is relatively easy.  I throw one curveball into it. I use 1 lb of defrosted shrimp and a defrosted chicken breast or a couple of boneless thighs.<br /><br />So if you look at the recipe list, bell pepper, celery, onion - all cheap total less than $2. 2 cups rice and water cheap less than a buck. a can of diced tomatoes - $1. a chicken breast/2 thighs, $2 or so (fresh or organic a lot more). 1lb sausage - hillshire farms? $2-4 depending on flavor/brand. than shrimp - $5-10 a lb.  So if we average things out it's $16.<br /><br />You need some time and space - dicing veggies and meat. deshelling shrimp takes some time. Then cooking the meat, first and having some place to put it while the veggies cook is a little extra, not sure you need to do this part, but I do. Then watching over it take 30 minutes or so. So from dicing to adding the rice can take 45 minutes depending.<br /><br />But it creates a lot of food. A lot more than my quicker more homemade Jambalaya recipe. 4+ meals. very flavorful meals I might add.  Also the Sausage is the main source of fat.<br /><br />It's not a quick recipe, but it's worth having a packet around for some really flavorful rice, veggies and protein. All in one pot... kinda see above paragraphs."
"i love this cat food for my cat! its the healthiest i could find for my budget. innova foods are too expensive but this cat food is not that bad and its very healthy. my kitty is very healthy and has the shiniest coat, and when i take her to the vet they always find her in perfect health. my kitty loves it and is not overweight at all"
"I try to feed my 2 cats organic foods, with no by-products in it. This food fits my requirements. Plus both of my cats LOVE this food. They even refuse to eat moist foods of any kind now. Their coats are shiny, they are lean and energetic!! Neither one overeats this food. My older cat was always plump when fed the famous name brand foods. Her coat was dull and brittle. Now it's shiny and soft. I love this food too, because I could feed it to the youngest when she was a kitten and not have to look for another 'adult' cat food when she turned a year. I love that I can order it online from Amazon.com. I find it less expensive on Amazon.com and I don't have to hunt for it in various stores. It's delivered to my doorstep. I highly recommend this food to all cat lovers! Just leave some for my cats!!:)"
"My cats were never very enthusiastic about dry foods - ""premium"" or otherwise - until they tried this stuff.  Now they get quite huffy if I try to give them any other brand.  It felt a bit pricey at first, but none of it goes to waste, even though it's been part of their diet for several months now.  Highly recommended."
"After looking over the ingredient list on the website, which lists meat as primary ingredient, and also saw their comparisons to other brands by ingredient, this product seems to be a solid competitor among top premium cat food brands. Now for the next question -- does your cat like it! Mine did, and she absolutely refuses to eat cheap foods, digging them out of her bowl and batting them around the kitchen floor to let me know what she thinks about them if i try to feed them to her. The manufacturer has used one of the same processing plants that Blue Buffalo and Natural Balance used in the past."
"My cat has always had a very sensitive stomach. Even on Science Diet she would have diarrhea. Ever since changing to Harmony Farms her stomach has improved tremendously, and her skin seems alot healtheir as well.<br />I managed to get this cheaper at Stop and Shop in New England tho."
"I'm writing this review to add another strong voice in support of the quality and value of the Harmony dry cat food. Like the other reviewers, I had searched long and far for a food that fit my tough guidelines for healthy ingredients.  I found the indoor formula Harmony cat food at my local supermarket, was impressed after reading the ingredients list and decided to try it on my six cats ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old.  Each cat, without exception, took to the food right away.  When I found the chicken and rice formula at Wegman's (40 miles away), I switched my cats to that because I was concerned that the indoor formula for outdoor cats might not be the right balance of nutrients since Harmony went to the trouble of developing two varieties.  Once again, my cats took to the food right away.  I feed them dry and wet food and decided to try the Harmony canned.  In the past, I needed to mix some of the food I was trying to replace with the new food--but that was not necessary with the Harmony food.  I've been a cat caregiver for most of my 59 years.  I have never found a cat food that was so well received by my feline friends as Harmony.  In fairness to the single one star reviewer in this group, I looked up the Royal Canin brand.  I was not positively impressed by the ingredients list.  Besides that, Royal Canin has at least 3 varieties of dry food--a protein, a smell enhanced, and a texture variety. Huh?  I just wonder if all of the 1 star reviewer's 60 felines can agree on the same variety! On the point of the value of purchasing this food through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it is by far the best pricing I've found.  Wegman's--again 40 miles away!--sells it for $12.99 with a Wegman's card--$14.99 without.  Through this program, currently I can get the food delivered to my doorstep for $12.66--no more long drives to Wegman's and less expensive to boot!"
"I decided to return to a natural food for my male cat. He has the tendency to overeat and I battle to keep him at a healthy weight. This food has MEAT as the first ingredient; this is rare to find. It is also available at my local grocery store. Not only does he love it, my little adult female does too. She sneaks over and steals from the male's bowl when he has left some food. For medical purposes she is on kitten food, so I do not feed her the same food. I was hoping that with no fillers, my cat would fell more satisfied. I mix up fiber powder and water with the male's cat food and he is more satisfied and usually does not beg for more food.  I just wish the company made a larger bag than 6.5."
"One cat liked it (she likes anything remotely resembling food) but the other one didn't.  Unfortunately, since it is easier to get food for both and not 2 different kinds, I have to go with what the finicky one will eat."
"We've tried a variety of different cat foods over the past year or so and this was our ultimate winner.  One of our cats has some GI issues and while we never got a straight diagnosis, they appear to be related to gluten consumption.  We had them on prescription cat food but given that there are 4 of them (and only 1 with the issue) this was getting expensive.  We gave this a try and while the GI issues didn't 100% go away, they became significantly better (as much so or more so than when on the prescription food).  Perhaps most importantly, it was generally healthy for all the cats and they all loved it."
"I used to feed my cats a mixed diet of wet and dry friskies and one of them also used to have a problem with throwing up/hairballs.  She would routinely throw up every other day.<br /><br />Ever since switching them both to this cat food, my feline compadres have had no issues at all.  The one with the throwing up problem hasn't had an episode in weeks now and the other eats less and seems far more happy over all.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey but for the peace of mind and healthy state of living it's given my cats, I can't complain."
My older cat was begining to have stomach problems.  It came on suddenly and I felt that it was due to a change of ingredients put in her dry cat food.  I began to look for a higher grade of food and read multi reviews on products.  I felt that Harmony Farms had the most consistent positive reviews.  Also owners with cats who were having digestive issues seem to have a higher percentage of improvement when changed to Harmony Farms. She had dramatic improvement almost immediately.  She still is having ocasional issues but she had developed severe inflammatory problems.  Take great caution in considering what you feed your pets.  I changed my dog as well!!  It was a good decision and I am very pleased with Harmony Farms and Amazons shipping it to my home.
"First, it arrived exactly in two days thanks to the prime shipping! So that's already a star there.<br /><br />Anyway, I adopted a cat recently who was a bit on the heavier side and a little bit older (3 years old). I wanted to give him the best food possible and wanted to make sure he would be happy and healthy. Also, the food that I was feeding him was the atrocious Walmart ""Special Kitty"" brand so anything was better than that.<br /><br />I didn't even need to transition my cat at all. The second I opened the package to feed him his first bowl he was all over me! Would NOT leave me alone until there was kibbles to be eaten in his bowl. Now whenever he hears me putting food in his bowl he comes running. He loves the stuff.<br /><br />He already seems more active and alert after just a couple days of eating this awesome food. The price wasn't too shabby either compared to other natural/holistic cat food brands."
Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious and not a conglomeration of by-products and chemicals?  My first trial was with a major name brand but they had some quality issues that concerned me.  Other quality brands were not available locally so I searched Amazon and found what I was looking for.  I can obtain this product on their subscription program which includes free shipping at the interval that works best for me.  All in all I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon's service.
"Amazon offers this food at a great price. My local supermarket no longer carries this food after the jumped in price to $15.79 a bag. My cat really likes the food and he is extremely picky. I went through 4 other types of ""holistic""  before he would even taste one. That's how we found Harmony Farms cat food."
"Multiple homes, total of 60 cherished cats who are given premium foods. The ingredients & reviews made me try this food; not 1 cat liked the taste, which is a first. Gave the bag to the wildlife reserve raccoons, who did consume it. I am unlikely to venture again from the Royal Canin varieties they adore, and does make their fur glow!"
"...especially hot ones, these are the radish for you!  My first sprouting attempt was with Sango radishes in a jar in my kitchen.  They were delicious and intense in that spicy radish taste...tiny, but they pack a lot of flavor.  Full-grown red garden radishes from your average supermarket taste like flavorless styrofoam in comparison."
I love this product I advice any and everyone who love gumbo to purchase this product it is wonderful.My experience with this item was the best experience my quest enjoyed the food and the taste of this product
"I can buy this item in my home town Gro store for $1.39, and you can make it at home from scratch for about 50 cents"
"Okay, that might be a slight exaggeration seeing as how I haven't tried every tea in existence, but this tea is pretty darn good.  While I cannot speak to quality of the distributor, the actual flavor of the tea is pretty amazing.  It's a sweet, herbal flavor that's mild but tasty and brews light like a true chamomile.  While it's fabulous on its own I used it for an impromptu chai-style latte with steamed french vanilla coconut milk coffee creamer (So Delicious brand) and I was in heaven!  I will now be ordering this en masse to carry around with me to drink EVERYwhere and I will tell EVERYone who is within earshot that they are silly for not drinking this and this alone.  ForEVER.<br /><br />Twinings, I'm in luuurve!"
I received this today and I almost ate the whole jar!!!!  I had to stop myself.  It is wonderful..............creamy and very tasty!  Love it!
"I ordered these as a Lightning Deal. Never tried it but it was like 50% off. I love spicy food and can never find anything I consider ""spicy"" anymore. Cooked these expecting ""spicy"" to be ""tangy"" as usual. WRONG!<br /><br />I drained 95% of the water out like I do with Ramen Noodles. Put the flavor packet on, and WOW it was SPICY. But I love it - great flavor. I had to cool my mouth down with chocolate milk. This from a guy who always orders the spiciest level at any ethnic eatery I go to.<br /><br />I'm sure if you don't drain all the water out before eating like I do, it will be fine. I plan on draining about 75% out next time. Finally, a food labeled ""spicy"" that actually is!"
"I'm eating these for the first time as I type. (I've written reviews on the double 12-packs of Bowl Noodle, by the way, if you want to know my opinion of Bowl Noodle in general.) Shin Bowl Noodle are every bit Bowl Noodle (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDO2YC"">Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Kimchi, 3.03-Ounce Packages, 12-Count (Pack of 2)</a>). This particular flavor's very spicy and oozes the essence of black pepper. All-in-all, this is like gourmet Bowl Noodle. It has more soup base and it's thicker; the vegetables are higher-quality and revive better than those in Bowl Noodle, and are more flavorful. If you're a Nong Shim fan, this is a must-buy! If you like Hot and Spicy Bowl Noodle, especially, or just any Bowl Noodle variety, you're going to like this."
"If you like food with a kick these are the noodles for you. I can't even eat a regular bag or cup of Ramien noodles after having this spicy brand. We have one of those hot and cold water dispensers at work and I use the hot water to fill the bowl, cover it for 5 to 7 minutes, and it's ready to eat. Are you really bold ... drink the broth afterward!! I've tried the Shin packages, the Shin bowl, the small Shin cup and the large Shin cup ... all the same great flavor, just different sizes. Of course, the package requires a bowl and a tiny bit more effort to prepare. Order it through Amazon grocery by the case for the best price or put it on your auto subscription for an even better deal. A case is usually two boxes or 12. I get a case through auto ship every 3 months, but I've also got half my family hooked on these too. Great stuff!!"
"Nong Shim makes the best instant noodles on the market, and of them, the Spicy Picante is my hands down favorite.  The noodles have a great testure and the broth is wonderfully spicy.  And a bowl actually satisifes as a meal, which is not something I can say about say, Oodles of Noodles."
"I really am enjoying these spicy noodles and love the spicy flavor. However, I am very disappointed that you cannot microwave these (yes, I have tried and the foam almost buckled). Anyways, if you enjoy ramen that is hot you will like these. Two in a sitting is perfect."
"The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors.  It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants.<br /><br />In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free.  This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats."
"First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"
I finally found this soda at a local store. Not much on the shelf. I tried the zevia regular cola (bad aftertaste) the root beer one (this is my favorite) and the orange one (good). I didn't get the lemon/lime one. This rootbeer one is delicious. No aftertaste like the cola one has. I love rootbeer so I will continue to buy it. It is expensive at $1 a can and for the 6 pack it cost me $5.99 with no tax on it. It is a much better alternative to the diet sodas out there. I don't use artifical sweetners or have sugar in my diet except for stevia. I hope the price gets lower as other stevia colas come onto the market.
"I am currently drinking my second can of Zevia Root Beer, having managed to sneak it away from my three kids.  It's got a rich, full flavor and plenty of fizz--all our cans did.<br /><br />I left a fuller review on their Cola entry, but everything I said there stands for this variety, as well.  It's just as good as either sugar-full or sugar-free brands, but is not bad for you, and even good for you because of the stevia, which can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />Makes a killer float, too, with my own homemade sugar-free artificial sweetener-free ice cream."
"When I found out about this product from Jorge Cruise's site, I couldn't wait to try it.  It took many visits to specialty stores (names obtained from the Zevia website) before I finally found one that had just two cans of the Ginger Root Beer in stock.  I bought both cans, even though I never really drink root beer.  After tasting Zevia Ginger Root Beer, I love root beer now!  This is my favorite flavor, even over Cola and Orange (haven't had the Twist, yet).<br /><br />Everything in the Ginger Root Beer is natural, and there's no caffeine (like the Cola, even though it's supposed to be natural caffeine). The cola is  my next favorite that I have occasionally.  I did not care much for the orange, it tasted artificial and not very orangy-tasting. I highly recommend the root beer flavor, though."
"My wife and I have tried the four flavors of Zevia and we both have this as our favorite.  Using Stevia instead of sugar or the common sugar substitutes is great.  The price is OK.  It would be nice if Amazon could make a deal with Zevia to offer ""FREE with Super Saver Shipping"" in the future.  At this time the $9.89 shipping makes the price less attractive.<br /><br />When we drink ""traditional"" soft drinks we mostly drink diet drinks.  We get Diet Dr. Pepper and Diet Pepsi (when available at places like restaurants) as first choices.  I tolerate Diet Coke when I want a diet soft drink at a restaurant and none of the above are available.  Although, I may also get a non-diet soft drink if that is the case.  I included some of the other drinks we like, since taste is subjective.  Hopefully if you like the above drinks, Zevia's Root Beer may be to your liking."
"I've been trying to give up all diet sodas containing aspartame and splenda because of all the online research I've been doing on those sweeteners.<br /><br />This root beer is the first Zevia product I have tasted.<br /><br />It doesn't have a very strong root beer flavor -  more like a mix of root beer and ginger ale - to it and it tasted a little flat.<br /><br />For me, the flavor is just ok.  My root beer happy 8 year old didn't like it at all."
"I really like the ginger root beer, and have just ordered a case. But the cola was awful; had a bitter taste."
"I cannot compliment this brand enough.  I've been purchasing all flavors of Zevia for the past few years and absolutely love it.  There isn't an aftertaste at all, and it is simply delicious.  Zevia's Root Beer is among my favorite flavors.  My other Zevia favorites are black cherry and orange, however all their flavors are super!<br /><br />My favorite things about Zevia are that they are sweetened with all-natural stevia and do not contain any harmful chemicals.  Also, I love the fact that there are not any calories in it.  There are no artificial colors or flavors either. Truly guilt-free!<br /><br />The only Zevia flavor I've seen caffeine in is cola.  All the others are caffeine-free.<br /><br />I deducted a star from this product due to the pricey price point of Zevia. I still continue to buy it, but not as often as I would like to due to the cost.<br /><br />I have emailed the Zevia corporate team and they are responsive, professional, and friendly. I trust this brand.<br /><br />I hope you give Zevia a try. I think you will be pleased!"
"Really love the root beer.  Also like the ginger ale, but think the root beer is my favorite.<br /><br />I tried the orange and didn't like that very much.<br /><br />There's a new one Dr. Zevia, that looks very good, like Dr. Pepper I guess, that has caffeine if you want caffeine, but I haven't tried that one.<br /><br />I find the Zevia very refreshing and great.  At first there was a very slight unusual taste, but I quickly got used to it and now really like it.  Especially since it is zero calories and no bad things in it, like aspartame.<br /><br />Not sure why some of the Zevia's qualify for no shipping and others have a large shipping fee.  I always look for the ones with no shipping fee and that is how I tried the root beer."
"This has a bland, unpleasant taste, and the mouth feel is not like any other soda I've had, regular or diet. It's very unpleasant, and I can't believe I paid almost $1/can for it. I'd donate it to the local food bank, but I don't dislike poor people that much."
"Tastes Awful, and super pricey, don't buy this stuff!! It may be orgnaic but it tastes like it comes from chemistry set of a ten year old. yuckyy."
"I was pleased to have received a couple of $3 off coupons for Zevia, which brought the cost of a 6-pack in my area down to just $2.50.  I was eager to try this with my family as an occasional treat (we rarely drink soda).  We all tried both the cola flavor as well as the ginger root beer flavor and, after about 1/2 of a small glass, every one of us (including my young kids) said, ""Ick!"" At the first taste, it is o.k. But, after you've had a few drinks, there is very little to differentiate Zevia's taste from any other diet soda.  I guess if you are a normal diet soda drinker, this might be a wise, somewhat more natural alternative.  Stevia takes a little bit to get used to, but, this is NO substitute taste-wise for regular pop.  We'll stick with our Blue Sky sodas, sweetened with cane sugar and caffeine free, for the occasional treat."
"I am a big fan of root beer, But this stuff is nasty. It taste like medicine. I did enjoy the orange and lime flavored Zevia soda."
"These Amazonian demons got me hooked on this, and now there's none available at regular prices. Tried Hansen, and that's ok, but like this one better."
"Okay I have tried every diet soda, I have cravings for soda but no one needs the large amount of high fructose corn syrup that they put into the regular sodas. The Zevia Ginger Root Beer is Good. I won't say it tastes like regular it doesn't but it's as close as you are going to come. It is worth the price."
"I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the ""big two"" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard ""bad things"" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called ""erythritol"" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol ""shouldn't"" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it ""supposedly"" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the ""bad"" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product."
"This soda is amazing!  The True Ginger Root Beer Flavor is delicious!  If you have a member with type 1 or 2 diabetes, or your just trying to stop drinking artificial sweetners like aspartame, nutrasweet or even sweet and low, then this is the NEW soda you will LOVE!  Imagine taking a sip of a truly delicious ginger root on a hot summer day.  The quench you can feel all the way down your throat as you swallow.  Upon entering into your body you feel energized and ready for your next task.  Imagine no calories, no harmful artifical flavorings.  This has been a real treat to find.  No matter what the price,, you deserve to try this and see if this soda will help your body."
"I was skeptical of a health-foodie soda of all things! I initially tried this when a friend got it for a gathering. Not only is it good for you: using stevia, no calories, no sugar--it is really delicious!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />-Delicious flavor: Ginger Root beer is my favorite<br />-No calories, no sugar is great. I don't like drinking soda because it is so bad for you, but since this is all natural, it is great to be able to have it as a refreshing snack or with bbq food or comfort foods! I usually steer away from diet foods because they lack in flavor and constantly remind me that I made a ""DIET"" choice instead of a happier choice, but Zevia has succeeded in making a happy, healthy drink.<br />-Stevia does have a distinct taste or lingering sweet taste on the tongue that is definitely not the same as real sugar. It's not unpleasant, but it is just a different palate experience. I actually like it! I normally don't use stevia in my drinks, especially hot drinks, because of this difference, but this soda really uses it well.<br />-Addictive in a great, refreshing way :)"
"I'm so happy to find a soda without sugar or artificial flavors that actually tastes good!  Thank you Zevia, my 14-year-old son loves it and so do I!"
"A friend just gifted me some of this soda.<br />I've had stevia on hand for several years and have a plant growing in the garden now.<br />I'm not a huge rootbeer fan, but this tastes very good.<br />I'll be anxious to try some of the other flavors.<br /><br />Several years ago when I purchased my first stevia plant, it was too early to plant it outdoors so I had it growing in a window.<br />One of our cats ate every leaf off the plant and killed it, but the cat didn't have any reaction other than disappointment that the plant died and didn't provide more leaves to munch.<br /><br />I'd rather drink water than most of the diet sodas available.  It's wonderful to have an acceptable diet soda, even if it is pricey."
"I found this soda on sale at Whole Foods for $4.99/6-pack as part of my mission to cut excess sugars out of my diet. I can't stand other artificial sweeteners, so after researching stevia (a calorie-free natural plant-based sweetener) and xylitol (the only sugar alcohol that doesn't cause gastrointestinal distress), I decided I would give Zevia a try.<br /><br />The ginger root beer flavor is fantastic and caffeine-free. I can barely even tell that this is not a cane sugar soda. The only difference to me is that the sweetness lasts with you a bit longer, but it doesn't bother me and goes away with a swig of water. I love that it contains real ginger and other extracts.<br /><br />I did not like the black cherry Zevia at all, too sweet, and I have a feeling the lemon/lime and orange flavors would be equally off-putting due to the flavor profile of the sweeteners being used. I want to try the Dr. Zevia and cola flavors next, although I wish there were caffeine-free versions, as I like to enjoy these sodas in the evening."
"Tastes great. Seems to have slightly less fizz than a regular soda, but with none of the harmfull stuff. Wish it was a bit cheaper, as $1+ per can is a little steep, but it really is great stuff."
I love Zevia Ginger Rootbeer! I thought it might have a bitter aftertaste like other diet soft drinks but it didn't. I started drinking it because I am watching my carbs and sugar grams but like a good rootbeer once in a while. I wanted to be able to have one without a lot of sugar and without artificial sweeteners. I'm so glad I found out about this one. It hits the spot every time.<br /><br />This past weekend I took a sip of regular rootbeer and didn't care for it because I'm used to Zevia ginger rootbeer and prefer it. My husband enjoys it too and he's not watching his sugar or on a weight loss plan. He just likes the taste.<br /><br />I didn't think we'd work our way through our 24 cans so quickly. I'm looking forward to our next shipment.
"This root beer has a good foamy texture with a  thirst quenching  zip.It is free of chemicals and  aspartame and the water it is made from is triple filtered. The flavor is oustanding.The zevia line however is cost prohibitive; but if you drink diet soda and value your health, the product is worth the price,imo."
"Based on the positive reviews, I was excited about this product. UPS deemed the first shipment undeliverable, so I just received my reorder today. I have not had a diet soda in over 4 years and only 1-2 Dad's regular root beer liter size this past summer for ice-cream floats. Root beer is my second favorite to birch beer, however since I've technically given up sodas, it is a rare treat (or health hazard depending on your viewpoint) that I indulge. My taste-buds response was this product does not taste like Dad's, but more like a weaker root beer flavor and the aftertaste reminds me of how a diet coke tasted. I've used stevia in my coffee for several years and cannot tell it from sugar. I do not like it in hot tea unless it is chai, as otherwise I taste a slight cotton-mouth aftertaste similar to this product. Although somewhat disappointed, I certainly will drink the remaining 23 cans and may decide to try their Dr. Pepper and/or black cherry versions."
I was thoroughly pleased with the flavor of this root beer. Much better than what I was expecting for zero calories and stevia sweetened. Definitely a keeper.
"I've been searching for a soda that doesn't have the negative health issues of high fructose corn syrup or Aspartame, and this one fits the bill.  The taste is different than either of the other sweeteners, but I like it as it is. I hope that this becomes more mainstream, as if more people chose this rather than traditional soft drink options, I think they would be healthier."
"I love this stuff! I don't allow my kids to have soda at home, so they were pleasantly surprised when I brought this home. They love the cola and root beer the best. Great flavors without the all the corn syrup and sugars."
"I will buy this product again and again.  Even my kids LOVE this soda.  No bitter taste and perfectly, naturally sweet."
Tastes great!  A super alternative to artifically sweetened diet drinks.  My kids loved it and asked for more.
"I've been trying to give up both Aspartame and High-Fructose Corn Syrup, so I was excited to find Zevia at my local grocery store. I've had stevia one other time, in coffee, and it seemed a little over-sweet, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by using a little less of it. I couldn't even finish a can of this soda though. Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger. I'm glad I only got a six-pack of this rather than buying the 24 through Amazon as I've considered doing before."
"I like the fact that it uses stevia (how much of it vs. the other sugar alcohol sweetener though?? I think stevia is not toward the top of the list of ingredients) and I have used pure stevia extract before, and I can tell you they are not using very much of it. It basically tastes like a fountain drink where the syrup was running out. I would not pay regular soda prices for this product, let alone the higher retail prices at places like Whole Foods. It seems to me they are basically jumping on the stevia bandwagon and it has more to do with marketing than actually using it to make a good product."
"Zevia drinks have been my favorite alternative to sugary or diet drinks. I like all the flavors I've tried but I really loved the Root Beer flavor. It reminds me of when I was a kid and enjoyed root beer floats. This is however a more complex drink with the natural flavors of wintergreen oil, anise oil, lemon oil, orange oil and ginger extract. This does contain citric acid which can cause tooth damage if you drink it too often. I think it is safe to say that this drink won't harm you if you only drink it now and then. My little Eat Safe handbook also says that Erythritol is safe at low levels. When you think of the dangers of eating too much sugar or artificial sweeteners then this drink starts to look pretty darn good. But drink in moderation. The problem with the ginger root beer flavor is that you will want two cans at a time. It really is that good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
"A while back, I tried Zevia's cola and was not too impressed.  I decided to give the company another go and tried the ginger root beer.  I think Zevia takes some getting used to, but compared to the cola, this product was not too bad.  The initial sips were strange with the flavoring more ginger than root beer.  I don't typically use ice with my drinks, but I felt compelled to drink this cold. I think I could drink this as a soda substitute.  The flavor isn't phenomenal but it is better than Zevia's cola option and it is a good alternative to mainstream aspartame-laden soda products."
"I love the ginger root beer its my favorite, I have at least 2 a day. Its taste like the real thing. I like the creme, its my 2nd fav, but it leaves an aftertaste, but I got use to it. The grape is my 3rd fav.<br />I have tried the orange, that's just OK. The cola taste just like coke. This stuff is on sale at chamberlands for 3.00 a 6 pack. That is where I buy it. Whole foods has it and they have a 1.00 coupon at the store or you can print one up at zevia website."
"This was my first Zevia soda. The root beer has almost a watery taste to it. And the aftertaste is probably as bad as with regular diet sodas. It's definitely not a creamy root beer (like I prefer), but if you're into the non-creamy, regular diet brands, I would recommend this."
"I'm a big Stevia user and was excited to see a soda made with it.  I haven't tried all of the flavors, but the ginger root beer is my favorite by far!  Yes, there is a little aftertaste.  But I think that is true of any diet soda.  I'm a big fan of Zevia and get it delivered via subscription service."
"Honestly, I love Zevia. It's the only way I can have soda again and not as a compromise. This stuff is not in any way inferior to its original brand names. Zevia root beer tastes exactly right. In fact, with all the flavors, I have not experienced the aftertaste you often hear mentioned, though I have to say that the many citrus varieties are all pretty similar in taste, but different enough that you can tell them apart. Zevia Root Beer is a win and one of the most flavorful of the Zevia brand if not THE most. I like others am a bit concerned about the use of erythritol but only because I have IBS and that product is related in some way to diarrhea and stomach problems. I cannot say I've had any problems as a direct relation to the ingredient but I would like to see what this would taste like sweetened entirely with stevia."
"Love this product.  My son told me about it, tried it and have been drinking it ever since.  I think I was addicted to a diet soda, but after drinking Zevia, I don't even like the taste of that other soda anymore. Having it shipped to my house automatically was the best thing I have done.  Hard to get my favorite (root beer) at the store anymore."
"I recently discovered I have candida and have been forbidden to drink anything with caffeine, sugar, or gluten, which cause a flare-up in my symptoms.  My boyfriend and I went to a food co-op on Saturday to find things that I CAN eat (very few traditional grocery store foods are allowed on the candida diet).  I noticed Zevia and was pleased to find that it's sweetened with Stevia, one of the few sweeteners I can consume.  The price was a little high (at a little over a dollar a can, plus tax), but I felt it was worth it to get my sweet fix.<br /><br />I was tentative to try this because we had recently purchased Truvia, and the taste right out of the jar was slightly bitter.  But with my first sip of the ginger root beer, I loved it!  It's very bubbly and light and refreshing; not bitter at all.  It doesn't weigh you down or coat your teeth with a sugar film like normal sodas, either.  And the ginger root beer taste is different than any other soda, too.  All that said, Zevia's Ginger Root Beer makes a perfect substitute to regular root beer.  If I could eat ice cream or have alcohol, I bet it'd be wonderful in a root beer float or mixed with blackberry brandy (my favorite!)<br /><br />I highly recommend at least giving this soda a try.  I haven't tried any other varieties yet, but I can personally attest to the wonderful flavor of the ginger root beer, and anyone who's looking for a healthy soda option should consider Zevia."
"Out of all of the natural sodas I love this one. The taste is great!!! It taste more like the soda it represents, which is root beer. I have tried the diet cola, and the one that is supposed to be like the Dr. Pepper and this one has the closest taste."
Great tasting product! They need to drop the price back down to 20.00 a case like a couple of months ago. If they did that I would buy a lot more!
"To me, this is one of Zevia's most successful flavors.  I was pleasantly surprised - it reminded me of the root beer we used to get at the old of A&W Root Beer Drive Ins a few decades ago.  I didn't detect any unpleasant aftertaste for their Ginger Root Beer.  I tried this as part of the variety pack, but I would feel comfortable buying their root beer all by itself."
"I'm an old time root beer lover. Stewart's, Hiram's, Rootbeer Barrel....This is a wonderful root beer. I highly recommend this soda. I'm purchasing more."
"Can I just say Zevia rocks?  This stuff is delicious, natural calorie free sweeteners and impressive flavors.  This stuff reminds me of an older style bottled rootbeer, I can't quite place which one it tastes like, but it's good stuff.<br /><br />soooooooooo good."
This is another flavor of Zevia that I really enjoy. I prefer this to their Ginger Ale. This Is great straight out of the can or over some natural sugar-free vanilla ice cream. Root Beer Float!!!
"This is just an amazing soda. I like all of the Zevia flavors I have tried, especially the Ginger Ale, but this one is the best. It is crisp, refreshing, and has such a pleasant bite to it. We buy a case a month and it's not enough!"
"Love this, great taste - not the nasty aspartame or splenda stuff - I wish this wasn't so expensive  - My favorite is the root beer/ginger beer flavor.  No after taste.<br /><br />I wish this was available to use with the Soda Stream system - would be so cool!"
This soda dosen't tast like rootbeer to me. It tast ok but it needs somthing. I will not order this flaver.
Just chiming in to underscore the raves of those who give this root beer five stars. BRILLIANT flavor. Totally shames those manufacturers who use corn syrup instead of native intelligence and worthwhile ingredients. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended.
I really like the intensity of the taste of this product. It really makes my mouth tingle -- in a positive way. It's very refreshing.
"I have been drinking diet pop all my life.  This is the healthiest and best tasting natural, good for you drink ever invented.  I wish it was out in all the stores, as children could benifit from this if they insist on drinking soda pop.  It comes in many flavors, but Rootbeer is my fovorite."
"I got this from a local store, so nothing to say about delivery.<br /><br />I told a story about how I felt and got this in my review of the Zevia cola, so I won't rehash it here. Yes, I just plugged something for which I make no money.<br /><br />When I got it home, I noticed that one of the cans in the case wasn't Zevia but Blue Sky Free root beer. It was okay, but it also says something about how this stuff is packaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I let it chill and popped open a can, expecting something like Mug root beer but less so. It was actually pretty damn good, better than expected! The diet-y flavor is quickly overpowered by one that is decidedly root beer and only makes a brief cameo after the stuff is swallowed. While I would far rather have an A&W or Barq's, this is a very viable alternative if sugar and corn syrup are no longer your friends.<br /><br />The only real downsides I noticed is that there is no vanilla in it, instead it uses four kinds of oil extracts for flavor. Vanilla would have made it a five-star drink and if I have this stuff and some vanilla at the same time, I'll probably combine them.<br />Also, since I kind of assumed (I didn't look, sue me) this would cost a fortune to ship and handle, I found it locally. In the entire area of Arlington Texas, there are four places that sell this according to the Zevia stie. Four.<br /><br />Should you buy some? Sure. It lacks some of the satisfaction of more widely-available root beers, but 'diet' is Latin for 'nothing is as good as it could be'. Good alone, serviceable with Mexican food."
I have never really been a soda fan ever. Growing up as a kid the only soda I thought tasted good was root beer. As an adult and a vegan I know very well that regular sodas are just empty calories and a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup so I have stayed far far away from them.<br /> I use stevia for my coffee in the morning and I love it. I have done the research on all artificial sweeteners and I wont go near those chemicals. Amazon had recommended this to me by other things i have purchased. I was too nervous to buy 24 of them since i don't like soda and it could have tasted terrible. So my solution was to get a 6 pack at my local store.<br /><br />All i have to say is WOW! It has a great root beer taste. I am so pleased with this product I plan on keeping this an auto-ship. I recommend this to people who want yummy soda without the soda and future cancer.
"I have been wondering for years why there was no Stevia-flavored sodas on the market.  It had always been pick your poison between sodas loaded with insane amounts of sugar, or sodas flavored with Splenda/sucralose/aspartame.  I was thrilled to finally find the Stevie-flavored Zevia soda by accident while wasting time in a store, and got the 6-pack of root beer.  I thought it might taste odd, but it's actually quite delicious.  Costs $1 a can pretty much anywhere you get it, but kicking in a little extra pocket change for a guilt-free delicious drink is well worth it."
I have not indulged in soda for years because I refuse to partake in aspartame and have to avoid excess sugar. Finally we of similar bent have a choice! This is not a 'settle for' choice by any means! This root beer has the best flavor I have encountered. I recommend this product to everyone who wants to enjoy soda in a more natural state.<br /><br />Thanks for such a great product!
Zevia is the best tasting diet soda available.  I have tried the root beer and lemon-lime and love them both.
"Zevia uses the non-caloric natural sweetener stevia and all natural ingredients. Its so hard now a days to get a natural tasting ginger root beer and I find the taste refreshing.

"I haven't drank diet soda for many years and back then it was the nasty aspartame stuff.  Those drinks are an acquired taste but once you're off the corn syrup it's hard to drink a `regular' soda.  Zevia sodas also have a period where you'll have to get accustomed to the taste.  This is the third flavor of Zevia I've had up until the cola flavor I just got my hands on it was my favorite.  I was getting used to the stevia sweetened zing on earlier flavors of orange and black cherry before I got the root beer.  It tasted really good to me when I first started drinking it but it took my wife a bit more time to realize it was good.  She had stayed away from Zevia after tasting the orange which she did not like.  Zevia sodas still have a little aftertaste (the zing I refereed to above) that kind of sits with you for a few seconds but the longer you drink it the more used to it you get.<br /><br />However, there are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Root Beer is a very good tasting soda.  I'll definitely continue to drink it if I can afford to and Amazon has it available."
"With the use of of Stevia, a naturally grown sweetener, which apparently has no calories and no known health affects, this is the perfect soda for health conscious people. I have tried all the Zevia flavors. My favorites are Black Cherry, Root Beer, and Cola."
"The product is excellent.  My recent purchase came with a ridiculous shipping & handling charge which I thought I had deleted, thus eliminating the purchase itself. A subsequent e-mail said that the shipment was on its way (which I have now received).  Its summary in the statement said that the S & H was $108. & change.  I replied to Nutricity as directed and said that I wanted the product, but that the S & H was obviously a mistake, and would they kindly either eliminate the S & H or charge me a reasonable amount for same.  In reply they stated that I had agreed by the online order to pay for the S & H stated in the order (the total order of which I thought I had deleted because of the ridiculous amount of S & H), and therefore was responsible for the total payment.<br /><br />Is this the way matters are going to be?  Is there no recourse for me?<br />As stated to them and now to you==I love the product, but the S & H was obviously a mistake.  Please do what you can to remedy this situation.<br />  Yours truly,<br />  Nicholas T. Ancona<br />  Quatrocchi@netscape.com"
"Anyone who has done any research knows that equal, splenda, and H.F.C.S are one of the worst things you can put in your system, they are literally killing us.  But i love soda... weakness of mine.  so i've been drinking hanson's because it has real sugar the body can digest, but i don't like all of the carbs.  I've been using stevia and agave nectar for sometime now and was excited to see this product.  i absolutely love it, less carbonated than coke, which i like, and tastes great."
"Soooooo delicious. I want to drink one every day but it's so expensive that I have to limit myself to one every other day. :p<br /><br />But it's worth it! God, it's worth it. We need more diet sodas out there sweetened with Stevia. Thank you Zevia!"
"FINALLY AN ALL NATURAL ALTERNATIVE TO ASPARTAME. THE MAKERS OF THIS SODA HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB. RICH ROBUST ROOTBEER FLAVOR, NO AFTERTASTE, AND NO CALORIES. WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR?  DEEEE-LICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is not zero calorie nor actually sweetened with stevia! This is sweetened with a sugar alcohol, with a little stevia added. Each can has 50 calories and for a diabetic this stuff raises your blood sugar almost as bad as any regular sweetened with sugar soda. And the sugar alcohol gives you horrible gas. A big thumbs down to their false advertising."
"I am a big fan of Stevia over artificial sweeteners like Saccharine or Sucralose so I was really looking forward to switching my diet soda and I bought a case of this stuff having never tried it, but having read the rave reviews.  YUCK!!!!  It does not taste like root beer.  Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.  Hopefully the diet soda giants will break out a stevia-sweetened branch of their regular line, as Zevia isn't tasty enough to switch.  My wife and I threw out the rest of the case."
"I have tried the Cola, Black Cherry, and Root Beer, and in fact order all of them regularly.  These are great.  To be honest, my first can of cola, I didn't like but then tried it another day and ever since, I really like them all.  My favs are the Root Beer and Black Cherry."
"I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with. In fact, I haven't drunk root beer in twenty years or more. So when I ordered Zevia's Ginger Root soda and tried my first can, I thought I was going to puke. This stuff tastes exactly like Pepto Bismol.<br /><br />But you have to remember something here, I'm not a fan of root beer, so maybe this is the way it's supposed to taste. I've read raving reviews about this flavor on other sites but it's just not for me. That's why I had to give it one star.<br /><br />My opinion is subjective like any other one, but if you like root beer, I think you won't be too disappointed because my taste buds tell me that they have a good product, but one I can't enjoy. I know how strange that must seem to you but I can appreciate something even though I may not like it on another level."
"It's almost impossible to get Provencal fish soup in the U.S. so this was a nice find. The fact that it's available bumped my rating from 3 to 4 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'd have to say that it's good quality but not great, and at $18 a can, it's overpriced, and that's before you get hit with the big shipping bill."
"Brilliant way to indulge in the flavor of chocolate without having to think about sugar or gluten or anything else you might be trying to avoid.  Last year I drank this yummy organic tea while on a detox plan and it was very satisfying and felt decadent.  It smells like hot chocolate or, as my son says, brownies, lending a soothing aroma-therapeutic effect as well.<br /><br />The tea contains nutrients such as Vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium, antioxidants and Theobromine which boost energy and mood."
"Steeping the cocoa bean shells into a fragrant and delicious tisane is such a stroke of genius. The pure chocolate flavor and aroma is outstanding. For those who say it is watery, thin, bitter etc...This is not Swiss Miss Sweetened Hot Cocoa. If you appreciate a natural chocolate flavor extracted from the cocoa shells thus also rendering all the known health benefits of chocolate, without the sugar and preservatives then this is a must try. Sure you can add milk and sweetener if you desire but please, do try it plain first. It needs nothing. I also left the shells in my mug and let them settle at the bottom with no negagtive effect on the flavor. It is impossible to oversteep this. The flavor only becomes more intense and stays smooth. Also a big Thank You to Bill at Tisano who was super helpful & friendly in our email exchange."
I got a Tin for Christmas from my wife.  I did not know what to think as I have never heard of Chocolate Tea...  We prepared a few cups for some friends and were very pleasantly surprised.  The rich aroma of chocolate in a cup.  MORE enticing is the smooth texture of this magical elixer... It is truly a nectar of the gods... If you don't believe me check out the buzz from other reviewers and tea bloggers...
"I just opened the package and made my first cup - and immediately logged on to Amazon ordered two more packages of this tea!<br /><br />The heavenly aroma of chocolate filled the kitchen as soon as I opened the tin.<br />The cocoa shells are light, crispy, delicate, and CHOCOLATEY.<br /><br />I nibbled a few of them as I waited for the kettle to boil.... Crispy, crunchy and delicious!<br /><br />I decided to use a coffee press for my cacao shell tea. I measured out the approximate amount, and  marveled at the aroma.<br />As I crunched on a few more of the delicious cacao shells while waiting for the boiling water, I became aware of my mood subtly brightening. The kettle whistled, and I poured the boiling water carefully into the cafe press. Rising along with the billowing steam, an unmistakeable scent of fine chocolate was strong and beautiful.<br /><br />I took my first sip and it was HEAVEN. This is like drinking the smoothest, purest dark chocolate. Even without added milk and sugar it is just beautiful.<br /><br />The mood-brightening effects of the theobromine are amazing. I feel happy. Coffee can make me crabby, but these cacao shells are having the opposite effect.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />I am very happy with this product."
I really love this tea !  it really is a wonderful smelling -- it tastes great  -- it really doesn't need much honey  -- I love the smell of the cocoa  -- it makes you smile if chocolate lover  --
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:17 Mins<br /><br /></span>My eastern european recipe for the best cup of Tisano chocolate tea ...<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0"">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>"
"I couldn't wait to try this product, and I wasn't disappointed. My fear was that it might be bitter, and acrid like unsweetened chocolate. This was not the case at all. The first thing that hits you with every sip is the wonderful dark chocolate aroma, followed by a smooth chocolatey flavor. The best part is the guilt free indulgence, no calories, very little caffeine, and all the health benefits of dark chocolate including, Theobromine which naturally raises serotonin (the feel good compound for your brain). If you like tea, and love chocolate try this tea!"
"I've tried other chocolate teas - black tea flavored with chocolate. They're fine but this is THE ONE if you want pure chocolate flavor. I have it without milk and add just a little natural sweetener (agave, brown rice syrup or cane sugar). All the satisfaction of a cup of hot chocolate but lighter. Wonderful stuff! I also love the fact that it's organic and Fair Trade."
"I was so excited about this chocolate tea! After reading rave reviews I thought I would give it a try. It tastes like you are drinking water-downed baking chocolate. It was incredibly bitter. I added a bit of raw sugar which helped a bit, but it didn't make it amazing. I think the only way that it could possible taste good is if you made it with hot milk and a lot of sugar. At that point you might as well just have normal hot chocolate. Save yourself the money- don't buy this.<br /><br />Side comment: I never received the lid to the tin. Who sends a tin without a lid? I am really not sure."
"I'm a bit of a noob to serious tea drinking. I've always liked tea, but only recently have I become completely obsessed. Within the last 6 months I've begun to accumulate all kinds of tea. Within that time period this tea has quickly made its way into my favorites and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out.<br /><br />I love this stuff. No, I mean I LOVE it. Seriously. While it isn't actually tea at all, it's prepared the same way - add the 'leaves', steep, add preferred additives, drink, YUM. There is no actual tea in this product, it's all cocoa bean shells. Because of this, you have to like the natural, earthy cocoa flavor (like that of dark, dark, dark organic chocolate you might find in a health food store) to like this tea. If you're expecting it to taste like a candy bar or cake you'll be disappointed. While it DOES smell like candy, it simply does not taste that way. (However, I suppose you could add an absurd amount of sweetener to give it a candy taste but that really counteracts a lot of the health benefits of this tea. It also takes away from it's natural taste which is amazing!)<br /><br />The thing that caught my eye about this tea initially was the flavor, of course. What made me really decide to make the purchase was all of the claims. The description says it has vitamin D and iron - which is especially good for someone like me who is both anemic and vitamin D deficient who could use as much of that in their daily intake as they can get- and it also claims to have natural serotonin raising capabilities due to the fact it's pure cocoa, which as most people know, is good for you and full of feel-good elements.<br /><br />While I can't prove or disprove any of those things, I will say this tea is delicious and worth the somewhat hefty price. You get a lot of bang for you buck and unless it's your staple tea you drink every day, several times a day it should last you quite a while.<br /><br />I'd like to note that the tea-to-water ratio recommended on the container might be a little exaggerated. I use a little over half the recommended tea to go with the amount of water I'm using, and it does just fine. It doesn't taste watery or weak at all. And unlike most teas, you can let this steep while you're drinking it and there's no gross, over steeped taste. I've also found you can also re-steep the tea 2-3 times before any substantial loss in flavor. Knowing that that, it can more than double the cups of tea you get per tin.<br /><br />Anyway, the main point is I really like this tea and recommend it."

But when I reached 112, well, I did the rebound thing. I was 112 in Dec. By 2nd week of Jan I was 133.<br /><br />How? I couldn't control my cravings.<br /><br />133 not alot. But compared to my 112, it was noticeable.<br /><br />Not to mention a HUGE jump.<br /><br />I felt like chocolate was controlling me.<br /><br />I embarked on a chocolate tea crusade. I bought every chocolate tea i came across. I know this isn't a weight loss product, but it's working that way for me!<br /><br />I was supposed to have lunch an hour ago. Guess what? Not hungry for it. I was in the mood for my yummy chocolate tea. So drinking that instead. It's great to not be controlled by hunger. Right now I feel relaxed and even a bit high! Whatever is in this tea is WONDERFUL.<br /><br />Hurry up and buy this  because I am about to buy the whole stock! Great addition to my weight loss battle or anyone elses!"
"I am new to flavored teas but love flavored coffee.  So a frien recommended Tisano Tea and I ordered the chocolate.  Wow!  It is so delicious!  It has helped me with my weight loss goal, when I want chocolate I have a cup of Tisano Cacao Tea with Stevia and I really feel satisfied.  I have lost over 30 pounds, Counting cals, exercising and drinking chocolate tea!"
"I love Stash decaf chocolate hazelnut tea but was looking for some variety.  This is not a ""tea"" it is made from cocoa shells.  I read all the reviews so I  was kind of wary of purchasing.  A few people stated that it did not have a great flavor.  The smell is amazing and I feel like I am having a treat that has no calories.  It does not, as others stated, have a really strong rich flavor but it is a smooth chocolate taste that is very satisfying.  I  do add milk and sweetener as I do with coffee.  I am not sure I would love it plain.  I will definitely spend the money again."
"So after making some long over due changes to my lifestyle which resulted in losing 160lbs and counting (about 50 more to go) and being able to get off all my medication including those for High blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes I thought something like just enjoying a cup of hot chocolate would be a thing of the past. Even with my new healthy life the occasional cup is still out of the question as I'm now lactose intolerant. Figured my chocolate drinking days were behind me. And I was certainly skeptical about trying a tea based replacement when I stumbled across this. I'm not a tea drinker, at least I never was before, but cutting out all soda left me with just water and the occasional glass of fruit juice so adding tea is something I'm now doing for variety and the health benefits. And finding this chocolate tea has been a real treat! It tastes good!<br />At first sip, I wasn't sure, it was like a very dark bitter chocolate, maybe some like that, but not me. But when I added a packet of splenda to it...magic! I swear it was just like a cup of hot chocolate, so good I had to have a second cup! ^_^<br /><br />Even if I weren't lactose intolerant, or concerned with calories and sugar content of which this has none of either, I would still be drinking this.<br /><br />It's that good!"
"I ordered Tisano Cacao Tea for my husband as he loves hot chocolate and I thought I'd surprise him with the tea.  He kept waiting for his surprise package every day and it never came.  I emailed the supplier and got an immediate response.  They checked it out and found it was lost in shipping.  They emailed me saying they were sorry and another one was shipped out immediately. My husband enjoyed his tea last night with a little agave added for sweetness<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0"">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>.  I love the fact that they are Fair Trade and Ameriken Green had fantastic customer service.  Will definitely order from them again."
"I love this product and I love the fact that I can support the company because of its business ethics. This is the best tea and the best chocolate product I have ever discovered.<br /><br />I  found out about the tea by accident. I was really looking for chocolate nibs that were not covered in processed chocolate. Their chocolate nibs are sold through ""Eastbluff Trading Company"" and they got great reviews. The nibs are indeed amazing.<br /><br />But it is the tea that will keep me coming back. I plan to purchase this for all my tea and chocolate loving friends.<br /><br />Preparation: The instructions say to use 3 teaspoons full and steep for five minutes. I use more than the recommended 3 teaspoons, but I steep it twice. I also steep it for longer. After steeping I pour it into my Nissan travel thermos and add ""Sugar in the Raw"" to taste. The ""Sugar in the Raw"" enhances the flavor of any tea and it is the same with this one. I don't need much. It is delicious without the sugar, but it is my treat so I do like a little hint of sugar.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is better than a chocolate bar any day!"
"I was really excited about getting this tea. I have been attempting to eliminate bad foods and drinks from my diet so I thought this would be a good way to curb my chocolate cravings. The best thing about this tea is how it smells, it really is amazing. The flavor however is not so amazing. I do not know how someone could drink this without any kind of sweetener or milk added because it really does have a bitter taste. I added some sugar substitute to my tea as well as a small dollop of whipped cream. I enjoyed the taste of it after some doctoring but overall I do not think it is worth the nearly 15$ price tag. I am a fan of very dark chocolate but I had trouble with this. It seems very strong and likely to induce a stomach ache if one is not careful. I will have to be in a very specific mood to drink this again."
"This is the first loose tea I've tried and I like it. I thought I would have to add milk and honey but I like it plain, too. The tin was chock-full and in good condition."
"I tried this tea at my daughter's house and loved it.  As a tea addict (there are worse things to be addicted to) or maybe I should call myself a tea collector because I try many different types of tea, I was impressed by how much chocolate flavor there was without any bitterness.  It really needed no sugar.  I normally make a pot of tea in the morning and then store it in a thermos to enjoy during the day.  Sometimes, when I haven't finished all of the tea by the next day, I might reheat it.  That's the only thing that I would say negatively about this tea.  It changes its flavor with sitting.  It's best drunk right after brewing."
tastes great with vanilla soy milk & some sugar/sweetener. smells like unsweetened chocolate. while it IS tea (it's not magic!) satisfies my sweet tooth.
This tea is fantastic. Chocolate is very good for us. Sugar is not.  Here's the best of chocolate without the sugar.  I confirm what the other viewers are saying: the plain tea tastes great.  An additional plus: some chocolate product can keep me awake at night; this does not.
"I can see why some people gave this product a bad review. This is not for everyone. Don't expect to make a chocolate milk shake with these cacao shells...<br /><br />I received it today. The tea has great chocolate aroma (as it should), and it makes a great (and unique) cup of tea. I also co-brewed my fresh-ground coffee beans with this ""tea"" using my french press. Result? Makes a fantastic cup of coffee with chocolate aroma. Right now, I am drinking this tea the way I should with some raw honey and fresh mint... YUM!"
"Easy to make (just like any tea) and has a nice smooth, relaxing chocolate taste. No sugar or milk needed but you can add it if you want it to me more hot cocoa-esque. I'm going to try adding some mint leaves and see what levels of joy will follow!"
"Tisano is this unexpectedly unique and tasty tea that is unlike anything available out there. Found this at a Whole Foods in SoCal and gave it a spin. A nice, pleasant aroma and flavor of chocolate presented in a fat-free tea format that can be served plain, with sweetener or even Queen's way with milk. It is a very healthy, anti-oxident and nutrient filled drink that tea drinkers and coco lovers should both be excited about.  I've only steeped it to drink it hot, but I'm curious what other things you can do with it in cold format for the summer. Enjoy!"
"I was lucky enough to get a free sample box of Tisano Chocolate Tea. What an amazing product and yet it has no added sugar or dairy. It is soothing and energizing at the same time and a wonderful beverage. The company does good works too...they give back to the Venezualan farming communities who grow their organic cacao.<br />I drink it ""straight,"" just brewing in hot water and, sometimes, I add a bit of milk to give it that hot chocolate consistency!<br />It might seem a bit pricey, but, remember, a little bit of tea goes a long long way."
"This tea smells and tastes like cocoa without the calories, sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Pour 8 oz of boiling water to 1 teaspoon of ground cocoa shell. Let it steep 4-5 minutes and when the water has turned chocolate,strain the chocolate pieces out and add milk."
"this is my new addiction. it is delightful. if you like dark chocolate, drink it plain. if you prefer sweeter chocolates, doll it up with sugar and cream. it is heavenly."
"I really wanted to love this, but at the high price--directions say 3 spoons per 8 oz water-- I like my Ghirardelli cocoa in hot water.  Just as good, waaay cheaper."
This was the best stuff for my first trimester!  Even my husband enjoyed nibbling on it. Not too sweet and full of ginger flavor.
My concern before this was ordered was if it was made in the USA.  My e-mail was quickly answered with a yes.  If you are a crystallized ginger lover this is the place to get it.  GREAT price and GREAT taste.  We will order from this site again.  The only problem I have with it is keeping my husband from devouring it before I can use it in my baking.
"I brew pods in my Keurig via the pod adapter <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WU8PW8"">Perfect Pod Holster Use Any Pod in Your Keurig Coffee Maker - Over 10,000 Sold</a>.  Some of the pods come out a bit weak, but not bad.  I've tried the Senseo, Cafe Halo, and Godiva pods, and all have been acceptable, but not outstanding.  The Wolfgang Puck pods appear to have more coffee in them, and provide a more robust flavor.  I've brewed several and have not had the tearing issues others have reported.  And the flavor has been the best of the pods I've tried so far.  Might be that these stack better in the pod holster for the Keurig than in a regular pod brewer, but I have been quite pleasantly surprised by how good these are.  Highly recommend!"
"I've long been a fan of flavored coffees so when we got our Keurig brewer we jumped on the opportunity to sample as many different flavors of k cups as possible.  Our first foray into the single-serve hazelnut world was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZKI"">Gloria Jean's Coffees,Hazelnut K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which was absolutely awful.  We've always enjoyed hazelnut coffee in the past, though, and vowed not to give up.  I ordered a sample pack of Wolfgang Puck's hazelnut directly from Keurig's website and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Thankfully, Hawaiian Hazelnut blows all of the other hazelnut k cups out of the water.  It is smokey and delicious without being dark and overwhelming.  The hazelnut really does taste like actual hazelnut, which you'd think would be something a coffee drinker could take for granted, but we've been disappointed in the past.  I'd never tried coffee from the Wolfgang Puck brand before, but our positive experience with Hawaiian Hazelnut has definitely gotten me interested in trying other varieties.<br /><br />The hazelnut flavor is pretty bold and full bodied, which is nice, but there is no bitterness or acidity to be found.  This suits me just fine since I enjoy a milder roast, but people who enjoy their coffee strong and dark might not enjoy this blend as much.<br /><br />We'll definitely be repurchasing this coffee when we run out."
"This is a nice balanced brew with a pleasant aroma, great for any time of the day.  Definitely one of my favorites for my Bunn machine.  I'm buying more when this runs out."
Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut coffee is a little pricey but are the best hazelnut pods out there.  Great rich smooth flavor.
Absolutely the best Hazelnut Coffee I've ever tasted.  And it arrived so fast - 2 days! Great purchase
"I, too, did a search on k-cups and Wolfgang Puck and this item came up.  I did not realize these were not k-cups until after I received them.  I read the other reviews and noted that grocery items were not returnable.  However, I thought I would try my luck and spoke with a customer representative.  I indicated to the rep that this item came up if you searched k-cups so it was a little misleading and I mistakenly purchased them thinking that they were k-cups and that I could use them in my Keurig machine.  The rep was extremely nice and helpful and offered to give me a full refund on my purchase (and I purchased 2 packs of the pack of 3 pods so I had 6 boxes in total).  He told me to keep them anyway since I couldn't return them but I received a full refund from Amazon.  Amazon is the BEST when it comes to customer service - that must be why I shop here again and again.  I offered to return the pods (I had not even opened the outer Amazon cardboard box yet) but the rep said that I couldn't return them due to the nature of the item.  The same flavor k-cups are great - I love them!"
"I bought this by mistake, I thought I was getting K-Cups.  Well instead of sending it back I opened the pods and used the coffee grinds in my Keurig...  I was very pleased with the flavor and the smell of the coffee is wonderful.  I hope Wolfgang comes out with this flavor in k-cups :)"
The flavor was excellent. Great aroma. All around drinkability.. Top notch. Quick shipment. Handy packaging. 5 stars. I will be ordering more soon.
"For some reason they are no longer making Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut K-Cups, my absolute favorite flavor. After I got over my shock and sadness I looked around at other options and found these. 54 pods for $20? Yes please! I put the coffee into the My K-Cup attachment for my Keurig and brew that way, and the taste is the same (if not better) than the K-Cups were!<br /><br />A disclaimer: I still have no idea what these pods are actually meant to be used in. I didn't even know what I was getting when I purchased it. At first I thought it was just loose coffee inside individual packages, which is close but not accurate - inside the package is the loose coffee inside a filter.<br /><br />I first tried to just stick the filter and coffee in the My K-Cup, and the result was pretty watery. So then I decided to rip the filter open and dump the loose coffee into the My K-Cup. This works great, although it takes 1 and a half packs per My K-Cup, so just keep that in mind if you are purchasing these!"
"I love the taste of the nice, strong coffee.  Just wanted the manufacturer to know there was a defect in the envelopes where the tear tab is defective.  The second box I opened, same thing."
this is my first time using these pods since the senseo pods were discontinued. they are excellent & robust in flavor. the pods are packaged individually for long lastng freshness. i would highly recommend these pods to anyone who has this type of coffee system.
"This was a re-order of the pods which are very good.  Ordered three boxes and gave them to friends because I told them it was great.  Only later found out that ""instant coffee packets"" of the product had been substituted.  UGH!  Big let down .. will go to BB&B for purchases next time."
"Come on, Amazon - correct the description for this product or correct the search feature so these don't come up as K-cups. I'll go to Bed, Bath and Beyond for these... and maybe the rest of my K-cup needs as Amazon just isn't getting the job done here.<br /><br />(And yes, before the trolls start in on me for not reading, I understand I should have read every word on the page - but honestly... who has time for that, lol?)"
I've tried like 6-7 different Wolfgang coffee pods.. not all are great.. some are just ok.. and this is one of them.. I really like the WP reserve & French Roast.. but that's it!
"I fell for the 30% off and tried these pods for my Senseo.  There is less coffee per pod than the Timothy's or Fratello's.  Granted this was a light roast, the coffee was still very weak.<br /><br />But the biggest offense?  The first 4 out of 5 coffee pods out of the box were torn (or rather, ripped just enough that the grounds are spilling out).  The vacuum packs were intact.  Just the paper on the actual pods were ripped.  What gives?  Avoid these overpriced pods and tell WP to send them back into redevelopment!"
"Please note that this is not a K-cup. It will come up if you search for ""K-cups"" but it is a POD and will not work in Keurig Brewer!"
"I purchased these pods believing they were k pods.  I than went out and bought a single use kcup to use this coffee which smelled delicious upon opening, but than I brewed it.  The coffee had an overwhelming smell and taste of cigarettes.  Horrible purchase and horrible seller with no return policy.....do not purchase unless you want Wolfgang puck cigarette coffee"
"Unfortunately,if you click on K cups on the left side of the screen these come up. They are not! They are are a non returnable item,so it is money wasted!!! I am so disappointed because it was so convenient to buy on Amazon."
Please specify if these are K-cups. Very confusing. Don't know if they would work with my Keurig Coffee Maker.
"This so far, is the best poundcake mix I have used that is gluten free. Its tastes great, and it does not crumble or fall apart after cooking it and flipping it out of the pan, or when cutting the slices to serve."
"I have not tried this brand before today, because in my B&M store it is 19.00 a box.(I still thought it was high for a cake mix on Amazon, but bought it anyway). It is really wonderful.  I found that it made a reg. bundt cake and a loaf pan ( so many Wfgf mixes make a single layer).  My bundt pan must be smaller because  the first time I filled it too full and had an oven issue and this time I was able to fill a loaf , and a bundt pant 3/4 way up , and they rose right to the top of both pans.  My family loved it enough to fight over who was going to get the last box for their birthday cake.. and I loved it enought to eat the whole piece , something I hae seldom done since the WFGF diagnosis .  This is really yummy ,  and I will buy it again."
"If you like sloppy joes and can't seem to get it right from scratch, this might be for you. The price of a little packet at the grocery store is $1.79 for about 1.5 ounces, so it makes this a pretty good deal. That is unless you find it on sale. I add a little ketchup at the end for the sweetness."
"i have looked all over for this cherry hot chocolate drink, i first purchased a can on the army base when i was visiting my daughter, we found we could order the same can using amazon and we enjoyed the product so much we ordered 2 cans in case we have a hard time finding it again."
ITS RETRO ITS BLACK JACK GUM WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY....IF YOU LOVE LICORCE CHECK IT OUT<br />PLUS IT MAY SOUND EXPENSIVE BUT ITS LIKE 1.00 A PACK. NO GUM IS A DOLLAR ANYMORE LOL
I was so excited for this to come in! It was fresh & I'm about to order more now since I just emptied the package! It shipped & arrived FAST as well! I was shocked! Thanks!
"I bought a bunch and gave some out at a booth at a show. Big hit when people just saw the package - it brought back memories.<br /><br />If you like licorice, you're gonna like this gum."
"Loved this gum. It was slightly, slightly stale when I got it, but still delicious. I still have some left (purchased it like a year ago or so) and its pretty stale now, but again, still flavorful. Love this gum, love this flavour, wish they made more of it more often, and that it was easier to get.<br /><br />If you like black licorice, get this gum for sure. Makes a good gift too (if the person likes licorice and/or is nostalgic)"
The only and best place I found to get this old timey product.  I send a case at a time to my son in law while he is deployed.  Love it
"Product was fresh, well packaged and was s taste of the ""good old days"". Longest lasting flavor of any gum I have ever experienced. I am hooked!"
Gave away packages of Black Jack gum for our 50th wedding anniversary.  This little gift was well apppreciated by the old timers.
"A while back somebody sent me an e-mail quiz which asked which of the following products, names, fads, etc you remember from when you were a teen in the 50s.  That person said that they remembered everything but Black Jack chewing gum.  I did remember it and wondering what happened to it I put a search on the internet and to my surprise found that it was still around and available for sale.<br />So I ordered it from Candy Crate and it came very quickly which impressed me.  I now have the pleasure of handing out packs of Black Jack gum to amaze all those of my age group.  Love the expression on their faces."
"Fast shipping, excellent product. My mother in law loves licorice and was so thrilled with this piece of her past that she wouldn't even share."
"EVERY candy I have reviewed has been given 5 stars. I think that shows how greatly the value of sweetness is appreciated in this world!<br /><br />I love Black Jack gum -- I never ate it when I was a kid-- I was too busy acquiring and devouring Chiclets and Clark Bars and Sen Sen and Sky Bars -- but once I tried Black Jack as a 13 year old going on 40, I tried it and LOVED it.<br /><br />The wonderful taste is unusual, memorable, deep, lasting and luxurious. It doesn't die on you like some gums do.<br /><br />AND -- if you put at least 2 sticks of this marvelous black gum in your mouth and chew them thoughtfully, you can  WRAP THEM AROUND your front teeth and then smile at people - watch them laugh -- LOL!!!"
"After chewing quite a few packs and giving away even more to friends,I noticed that the expiration date was July 31, 2010.... that is coming up on one year past expiration. (today is July 3, 2011)<br /><br />Despite the fact that the gum tastes fine, I can't leave a good review because of the lack of concern on the part of the Seller.<br /><br />Black Jack gum is good, Selling expired products is not."
"BLACKJACK GUM! CHEW IT AND YOU'LL BE A PIRATE LIKE ME! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! HEY GUYS, CHEW IT!"
"very unsatisfied with these seller i have it and expired date items how can they sell it ,........easy for them we can't check the expiration date from shopping on line."
"i love this cat food for my cat! its the healthiest i could find for my budget. innova foods are too expensive but this cat food is not that bad and its very healthy. my kitty is very healthy and has the shiniest coat, and when i take her to the vet they always find her in perfect health. my kitty loves it and is not overweight at all"
"I try to feed my 2 cats organic foods, with no by-products in it. This food fits my requirements. Plus both of my cats LOVE this food. They even refuse to eat moist foods of any kind now. Their coats are shiny, they are lean and energetic!! Neither one overeats this food. My older cat was always plump when fed the famous name brand foods. Her coat was dull and brittle. Now it's shiny and soft. I love this food too, because I could feed it to the youngest when she was a kitten and not have to look for another 'adult' cat food when she turned a year. I love that I can order it online from Amazon.com. I find it less expensive on Amazon.com and I don't have to hunt for it in various stores. It's delivered to my doorstep. I highly recommend this food to all cat lovers! Just leave some for my cats!!:)"
"My cats were never very enthusiastic about dry foods - ""premium"" or otherwise - until they tried this stuff.  Now they get quite huffy if I try to give them any other brand.  It felt a bit pricey at first, but none of it goes to waste, even though it's been part of their diet for several months now.  Highly recommended."
"After looking over the ingredient list on the website, which lists meat as primary ingredient, and also saw their comparisons to other brands by ingredient, this product seems to be a solid competitor among top premium cat food brands. Now for the next question -- does your cat like it! Mine did, and she absolutely refuses to eat cheap foods, digging them out of her bowl and batting them around the kitchen floor to let me know what she thinks about them if i try to feed them to her. The manufacturer has used one of the same processing plants that Blue Buffalo and Natural Balance used in the past."
"My cat has always had a very sensitive stomach. Even on Science Diet she would have diarrhea. Ever since changing to Harmony Farms her stomach has improved tremendously, and her skin seems alot healtheir as well.<br />I managed to get this cheaper at Stop and Shop in New England tho."
"I'm writing this review to add another strong voice in support of the quality and value of the Harmony dry cat food. Like the other reviewers, I had searched long and far for a food that fit my tough guidelines for healthy ingredients.  I found the indoor formula Harmony cat food at my local supermarket, was impressed after reading the ingredients list and decided to try it on my six cats ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old.  Each cat, without exception, took to the food right away.  When I found the chicken and rice formula at Wegman's (40 miles away), I switched my cats to that because I was concerned that the indoor formula for outdoor cats might not be the right balance of nutrients since Harmony went to the trouble of developing two varieties.  Once again, my cats took to the food right away.  I feed them dry and wet food and decided to try the Harmony canned.  In the past, I needed to mix some of the food I was trying to replace with the new food--but that was not necessary with the Harmony food.  I've been a cat caregiver for most of my 59 years.  I have never found a cat food that was so well received by my feline friends as Harmony.  In fairness to the single one star reviewer in this group, I looked up the Royal Canin brand.  I was not positively impressed by the ingredients list.  Besides that, Royal Canin has at least 3 varieties of dry food--a protein, a smell enhanced, and a texture variety. Huh?  I just wonder if all of the 1 star reviewer's 60 felines can agree on the same variety! On the point of the value of purchasing this food through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it is by far the best pricing I've found.  Wegman's--again 40 miles away!--sells it for $12.99 with a Wegman's card--$14.99 without.  Through this program, currently I can get the food delivered to my doorstep for $12.66--no more long drives to Wegman's and less expensive to boot!"
"I decided to return to a natural food for my male cat. He has the tendency to overeat and I battle to keep him at a healthy weight. This food has MEAT as the first ingredient; this is rare to find. It is also available at my local grocery store. Not only does he love it, my little adult female does too. She sneaks over and steals from the male's bowl when he has left some food. For medical purposes she is on kitten food, so I do not feed her the same food. I was hoping that with no fillers, my cat would fell more satisfied. I mix up fiber powder and water with the male's cat food and he is more satisfied and usually does not beg for more food.  I just wish the company made a larger bag than 6.5."
"One cat liked it (she likes anything remotely resembling food) but the other one didn't.  Unfortunately, since it is easier to get food for both and not 2 different kinds, I have to go with what the finicky one will eat."
"We've tried a variety of different cat foods over the past year or so and this was our ultimate winner.  One of our cats has some GI issues and while we never got a straight diagnosis, they appear to be related to gluten consumption.  We had them on prescription cat food but given that there are 4 of them (and only 1 with the issue) this was getting expensive.  We gave this a try and while the GI issues didn't 100% go away, they became significantly better (as much so or more so than when on the prescription food).  Perhaps most importantly, it was generally healthy for all the cats and they all loved it."
"I used to feed my cats a mixed diet of wet and dry friskies and one of them also used to have a problem with throwing up/hairballs.  She would routinely throw up every other day.<br /><br />Ever since switching them both to this cat food, my feline compadres have had no issues at all.  The one with the throwing up problem hasn't had an episode in weeks now and the other eats less and seems far more happy over all.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey but for the peace of mind and healthy state of living it's given my cats, I can't complain."
My older cat was begining to have stomach problems.  It came on suddenly and I felt that it was due to a change of ingredients put in her dry cat food.  I began to look for a higher grade of food and read multi reviews on products.  I felt that Harmony Farms had the most consistent positive reviews.  Also owners with cats who were having digestive issues seem to have a higher percentage of improvement when changed to Harmony Farms. She had dramatic improvement almost immediately.  She still is having ocasional issues but she had developed severe inflammatory problems.  Take great caution in considering what you feed your pets.  I changed my dog as well!!  It was a good decision and I am very pleased with Harmony Farms and Amazons shipping it to my home.
"First, it arrived exactly in two days thanks to the prime shipping! So that's already a star there.<br /><br />Anyway, I adopted a cat recently who was a bit on the heavier side and a little bit older (3 years old). I wanted to give him the best food possible and wanted to make sure he would be happy and healthy. Also, the food that I was feeding him was the atrocious Walmart ""Special Kitty"" brand so anything was better than that.<br /><br />I didn't even need to transition my cat at all. The second I opened the package to feed him his first bowl he was all over me! Would NOT leave me alone until there was kibbles to be eaten in his bowl. Now whenever he hears me putting food in his bowl he comes running. He loves the stuff.<br /><br />He already seems more active and alert after just a couple days of eating this awesome food. The price wasn't too shabby either compared to other natural/holistic cat food brands."
Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious and not a conglomeration of by-products and chemicals?  My first trial was with a major name brand but they had some quality issues that concerned me.  Other quality brands were not available locally so I searched Amazon and found what I was looking for.  I can obtain this product on their subscription program which includes free shipping at the interval that works best for me.  All in all I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon's service.
"Amazon offers this food at a great price. My local supermarket no longer carries this food after the jumped in price to $15.79 a bag. My cat really likes the food and he is extremely picky. I went through 4 other types of ""holistic""  before he would even taste one. That's how we found Harmony Farms cat food."
"Multiple homes, total of 60 cherished cats who are given premium foods. The ingredients & reviews made me try this food; not 1 cat liked the taste, which is a first. Gave the bag to the wildlife reserve raccoons, who did consume it. I am unlikely to venture again from the Royal Canin varieties they adore, and does make their fur glow!"
"I purchased this pack of 12 tins of Tropical Fruits mints at the same time as ordering another set that was a smaller variety pack of 6 different tins. ( see my other review )This package of 12 tins are all one flavor, but they are perfect for almost anyone who loves fruits, especially pineapple and other tropicals. The package could be broken up and used as stocking stuffers, since they are each individually sealed in plastic,  or as a lovely small gift for bridesmaids at weddings, after you have taken a couple of tins out for yourself, of course, as you will never be able to part with all of them! Very pleased with these and feel that anyone who loves small and attractive things for their purse or laptop bag, rather unique looking and classy finds, will likewise love this item."
originally found this product in local grocery...always sold out...then disappeared.  found it online in the yahoo market..great price and really great easy to use product.
"I have used this proguct for over 25 years.  First time ever having a problem.  When package arrived, outer box in good shape.  Upon opening inner box, found several bottles had leaked out contents.  Nothing broken.  Caps maybe not be correctly installed.  Lost 4 bottles out of 12."
"Barnies Blend is by far our favorite coffee. It is often requested by returning guests, It also makes a great gift!"
This is the worst coffee I have ever smelled and tasted.  It doesn't have a good aroma.  It smells and tastes like it has a strange chemical in it.  It doesn't smell anything like most gourmet coffees.  It definitely didn't have the butter rum smell or flavor that would be expected given that it was labeled as Butter Rum Creme.  Save your money.  Buy a different brand.
"I like a Starbucks latte as much as the next guy, and who doesn't like a sweet iced mocha with whipped cream?<br /><br />But I have a policy against drinking calories. One Starbucks drink can rival the number of calories in a Big Mac, and can have more than 2x the carbs! I also avoid sugar and caffeine, so this really limits my coffee choices. And on this subject, let me give you my personal guarantee - on decaf flavored coffees like this one, there is no taste difference between decaf and caffeinated. I can absolutely guarantee in a blind taste test you couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />So I sometimes prefer flavored coffee beans (as opposed to adding flavors to my drink). Decaf options are not always plentiful, so I love finding new flavors in decaf. This one (Paramount Butter Rum Creme) tastes like Christmas!<br /><br />When the package arrive, it smelled like burnt plastic. I almost returned it without opening it. But when I opened the bag, it smelled wonderful (not exactly Butter Rum - more like white chocolate). And it definitely tastes as good as it smells.<br /><br />Additionally, the price point is about right. I typically pay $6.49 to $6.99 locally for a 12-ounce bag of flavored decaf coffee, or $8.99 to $10.99 per pound for bulk coffee (at the grind-it-yourself kiosk). But decaf flavor choices at the local markets are limited, and if I pay local sales tax, there is less than a dollar difference than ordering this specialty flavor (I paid $16.92 for 2 bags. I got free shipping, & I also noticed there is a discount for subscription-based ordering).<br /><br />My only complaint would be, if you're making normal drip coffee, this might be too strong. You might try tempering it with 1 or 2 scoops of non-flavored coffee. At home, I typically make espresso, or cold brewed toddy. In both cases, I can use about 20% less of this product, and the flavor still comes out great. And, if I'm using 20% less, there is additional cost savings as well.<br /><br />Also, be aware the Paramount brand seems to grind their beans finer than normal drip coffee. This is how I like it - it's great for espresso, and ok for drip coffee - but not ideal for toddy or french press, and if you percolate it won't work at all.<br /><br />So here's my favorite coffee recipe for decaf:<br /><br />-Use the flavored beans to make 8 ounces of coffee (or 4 shots of espresso)<br />-Pour over ice in a large glass (it's ok to pour the hot drink over ice)<br />-Add 1 shot of half & half (I prefer heavy cream) - the result should be a caramel color<br />-Optional: If you prefer a frappe, pour the contents in a blender (I usually prefer it over ice, not blended)<br />-Add a sprinkle of cinnamon & nutmeg on top<br />-The result is a complex, sweet, robust treat that is sugar free, near-zero calorie, and non-caffeinated<br />-The taste rivals any store-bought latte, and puts Starbucks to shame (and costs pennies to make - not $4.00!)"
"The hot chocolate tastes absolutely amazing - so much better than anything you get at your typical coffee shop. Thanks, chocomize!!"
"Great hot dessert, easy and fast to make, not to sweet, since you make it in your microwave by adding water in the provided bowl and heating, it is easy to add nuts, dried fruit, peanut butter, etc."
"Pretty good.  I don't think it beats the real thing, but it's a good substitute.  Mine was a little dry, but otherwise satisfying."
"I've tried microwave ""baking"" and thought it was terrible. Perhaps because these are smaller and the sauce is added before ""baking"" these turn out good. I do think they need a small serving of ice cream or a small amount of whipped cream though to tone down the chocolate.<br /><br />A definite ""try to have around"" product."
This is so convenient and makes a great dessert snack for two. My husband and I share this treat.  I love the fact that everything (including the microwave bowl) is included in the package.  The chocolate cake is very moist and rich and the caramel topping is divine. I do like to gently blend some of the caramel down into the cake batter instead of just leaving all the caramel on top.  Yummy!!!
easy to use  and nice tast u can add ice cream it will be great taste .
"I had tried microwave cakes in the past and was always disappointed at the texture and consistancy of the end result, but not this time. The cake is almost as good as if you baked it in the oven only much quicker and easier. All you have to do is add water to the mix, stir together, squeeze the carmel from the packet onto the cake and put it in the microwave for approx. 1 min. and 15 seconds and you have a decent cake without the trouble, time and mess of making a full size cake mix.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be glad you did."
"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this gum.  Yes, the peppermint is strong at first and fades within two minutes, but it doesn't completely go away and the gum stays pliable and chewable.  The pieces are larger (75%-100%) than Spry's and you can blow bubbles with them!  There is no titanium dioxide  or glycerine in them (like Spry) and I feel this a better choice for our family.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this gum for oral health and enjoyment.  Nice to have a gum that isn't loaded with chemicals that I can give my children."
"The gum is too hard and small. The taste is OK, but I have to use two pieces to have enough gum to chew. I would not purchase again."
"The bottle was much smaller then I expected. The gum itself is OK, but too small and way too expensive for my plebeian tastes. Think I'll stick with sugarless gum. I wouldn't buy this again."
"I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and ""natural"", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and break the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this brand of gum."
"Forget the grandkids, we ate them!!! They have good flavor,too. I have purchased fruit snacks from other company's and the flavor doesn't compare to Kellogg's. Another grrrrrreat product from Kelloggs. Purchasing them from Amazon, was so easy and we received them in a short peroid of time. Oh, we will get more for the grandkids too."
"I bought these for office snacks since I am self employed, own my own business, and work in my office about 12 hours a day.  This is the best snack purchase I've made.  These aren't the half full bags you buy from a Dollar Tree store with about 4 fruit chews in them.  Each bag is packed full, and not only are these just delicious, they're nutritious too.  You might pay $1 for 8 pouches at the store but with the amount in each pouch this is still a better deal!"
"You can add hot water or milk. We have an instant hot water tap at our sink, so it is easy to get a great cup of hot chocolate. This is one of the best mixes that does not require milk. No trans fats. Great rich taste."
"These rose buds made a very delicious tea on their own, but I especially enjoyed adding a few buds to my English Breakfast brew to add a bit more sweetness. I will be buying these again after I use up all that I've already bought. They are excellent quality and I was quite impressed with the quantity in comparison to the price. I will use this seller again."
"These are okay for a mass produced product frim a factory.  Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />Ordered direct from the company's web site. Faced w/ 3 confusing choices: ship & deliver ASAP, ship whenever, deliver in time for Christmas. I chose the first thinking it was the fastest. My items were not delivered until 12/27. When I contacted Swiss Colony, they said, ""Too bad.""<br /><br />Next time I'll get real petit fours shipped from an actual bakery."
"These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that."
"The Petits Fours were excellent, moist and beautifully decorated. Great desert for a holiday buffet.  They also make a great hostess gift."
"These Petits Fours have become a holiday tradition.  For at least five years, my now-seven-year-old granddaughter has looked forward to selecting a ""cakey"" after dinner.  (:"
I sent Swiss Colony's petits Fours as a gift to my cousin and she loved them (as I knew she would).
"Ok, I know some of you may not like the choice of my words, 'mental orgasm'- but, once you try this cheese, you will agree.<br />I first tried some at a local cider mill last month and knew it was love at first bite. Once I got home, I called local stores in the area that carried a nice selection of cheeses. I can't keep enough on hand, it's that good...Just get yourself some crackers and you're set! I also grated some over pasta with olive oil, and grated some over tomato's then put it under the broiler. It has a nice dry consistency and the merlot is not overpowering. I highly recommend this award winning cheese!"
"I randomly pick up cheese from the grocery store and this was what I picked up last week.  It was gone in two days between myself and my boyfriend.  I, guiltlessly, ate 2/3's of it!  It is a unique taste and so creamy with a hint of Merlot.  I've been telling any of my friends who like either wine or cheese!  I went back last night to pick up another wedge.  It, by a long shot, replaced Brie as my favorite cheese."
"Delicious, amazing. I am not a cheese expert, so I can't use fancy words to describe the flavors. If you love sharp cheddar, this is the ultimate in sharp, full-flavored cheese."
"I have previously tried some of their cheeses and thought they were very good. This cheese, however, is extremely salty tasting."
"... not the orgasm others describe.  Why?  The best cheeses I've experienced have a certain ""delight"" about them that is unique, that distinguishes them from all others.  A certain surprise factor.  This cheese is very good and may well be the best of it's kind.  But it is not distinctive."
"This product is totally misleading for the customer. It was disappointing to receive only 2 individual pez items and not like it is in the picture or described. I agree with the other customer that customer service was great, it just sucked that it wasn't want I thought."
"As a Philadelphia resident I thought this would be a good item for Halloween distribution so I ordered 2 packs which should have been 24 total dispensers.  When I received the package I received only two dispensers, not the two packs.  The good news is Amazon's coustomer service was excellent.  Once they realized the error they promptly refunded my purchase price.  I was disappointed about not receiving the full order but recognize mistakes are made.  A prompt and courteous response with an good resolution is a positive for me."
"This is the most discusting tea Ive ever tasted Had to throw it away it was so bad. It contained Hibiscus with the possibility of peanuts, Rose hips, Blackberry leaf and tangerine oil, but couldn't find the flavors of Cinnamon or Orange among the other terrible flavors."
"My husband brought these home, and he was flipping out over these. I'm not a huge fan of green chilies, so I begrudgingly tried them. My goodness, they are delicious! Just the right amount of spice for me. YUM! Not to mention they are organic, gluten free, peanut and nut free, non-GMO, and basically every other ""good"" thing you can think of! These even have quinoa in them! Seriously delicious!<br /><br />One more thing, I have no idea what another reviewer was talking about when they said these chips have too much cilantro taste, as these chips have NO cilantro in them. At all."
"These chips are simply excellent.  SO delicious!  I'd give them five stars if it weren't for the fact that they're so high in sodium.  Outside of that, they're wonderful.  But you've got to be careful with them because of that high sodium content.  Tread lightly..."
"My usual grocery store just started carrying these and as I like to buy natural versions of ""junk "" food whenever possible  I tried them.  I'm almost a little sorry I did as I now have a mild addiction to them. The mild green chili spices and cheese are perfectly balanced into a taste more sophisticated than the usual tortilla chip. I wish I had a bag righ now. I'd eat the whole thing."
These taste amazing!  I use them in a taco salad or just plain out of the bag.  They have just enough of a kick and the fact that 10% of the profits of this company goes to sending kids to camps is just great!  Way to go Late July!
"Late July makes excellent products, and their Mild Green Mojo chips have plenty to crow about: they're whole-grain, the cheese doesn't use animal rennet, and part of the proceeds funds summer camps for kids.  The chips themselves are hearty and satisfying, like all Late July products I've tried  -  they don't incite that gobble-gobble-gobble never-full reaction that cheap junk food does.<br /><br />The problem is that, for all their fancy billing, the chips honestly don't have much flavor: they're labeled as ""green chiles with cheese & a hint of lime,"" but I don't really taste cheese or lime, and I taste the chilies only through a bit of heat.  The predominant flavor I get, besides the (admittedly good) whole-grain base, is salt  -  lots of it.  Even if every other flavor listed were full and vibrant, the sodium in these chips would be an overwhelming deal-killer.<br /><br />If you do decide to pick these up, don't worry about the smaller bag size  -  as explained above, you really do feel satisfied with a smaller portion size.  They're an example of a good company off their game, though, so my best counsel here is simply to pick another flavor in the brand.<br /><br />HEY, KIDS!: For summertime fun, count how many times the word ""organic"" appears in the list of ingredients."
We found these on vacation but couldn't find them we came home.  Thanks amazon for always having what I want!
These chips have a very strong cilantro taste. A little too strong for my taste. They've got a nice crunch though.
I'm very happy with this cat food. My three 10 year old cats are loosing weight after just two months use and seem to have more energy. Their fur seems to be softer too. I'm looking forward to seeing their progress at six months.
"This is so fun for the coffee lover - 1 pot at a time.  I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning and see what flavor I would pull out and try that day.  I enjoyed it so much - I thought it would make the perfect Christmas gift paired with a set of cool coffee mugs.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VLVF5W"">Arbuckle's Pastry Shoppe flavor sampler10 count single pot coffee packets</a>"
"At first the cost seems pricey, but if you consider how much coffee costs at Starbucks and other places, it is reasonable. The flavor varieties was good. I really like the convenience of the coffee being pre-measured. Just snip and pour."
I took a chance and ordered several boxes of holiday flavored coffees and it turned out delicious. Anyone who wants to try something unique in their morning coffee this is the way to go.
"Let's see, peppercorns at a good price...yep, that's what it is. ;)<br /><br />Product is as described and a good value."
Excellent product with quick shipping.  Great when you can't find peppercorns locally or want the freshest you can buy.
"I've come to trust Marshall's Creek Spices.  They've never let me down -- any time I wonder about them, I just look at my grocer's prices: about ten times higher, for spices that are probably only about 20% better."
"Arrived safely, in very good condition, went through a long journey (APO), and looks even better than the picture. Very good."
Where ELSE would you get multiple choices of flavored popcorn<br />WITHOUT them damned almonds and peanuts.<br />One word about the TASTE...<br /><br />WOW!
"This is caramel corn is absolutely delicious.  You can taste the quality such as real butter, good caramelization on each popcorn, and overall great craftsmanship.  Fortunately, I live in Seattle so I can buy this locally without the unfortunate shipping price.  I give this out to our visiting out-of-town friends who always beg us to send more because it is truly addictive.  If you live in Seattle or come for a visit, definitely give it a try since you will find them in most local grcoery stores and sometimes even on sale  :)"
"Lately, I have been on the prowl for Greek products in part to help the Greek export economy in a time of crisis. I was happy to stumble upon these rusks. They are great for serving tapenade, hummus, or cheese. If you are having a party, they are the perfect size for a Hors d'oeuvre tray."
"If you want to cook healthily for your family, you'll love this KING ARTHUR ORGANIC WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. If you're looking for a healthy, light whole wheat flour, a nutritionist recommended KING ARTHUR'S WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty. I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it. I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! It's a great way to sneak whole grains into desserts. I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. It has the whole grain yellow stamp on it, which my son says means it's good for you. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time."
"This tea has a wonderful favor, but I was disappointed to read the ingredients and discover that it contains black tea, which means it contains caffeine. I wish Lipton would state this in their advertising. Even on the box the caffeine is not mentioned. Also, I expected a stronger red tea taste, which I love."
"I love flavored tea, especially tea mixed with fruit flavors. The mixes that I like in this particular Lipton Pyramid Teabag series, include Bavarian Wild Berries, White with Blue Pomergranate, and Island Favor with Peach and Mango. I bought the Harvest Strawberry & Passion Fruit yesterday, and tried one cup today. I must say that this particular mix has to be the weakest one in this series, because the basic red tea is weak, and you don't taste the Strawberry nor the Passion Fruit favor. The two ingredients that stand out, believe it or not, are the hisbicus flowers and lemon grass."
"the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag."
This tea is wonderful...very soothing. I tried one box from Jewel and loved it so much I ordered a case from Amazon. Save $$ and now I have a good supply. Great for relaxing at night. Tastes great and is supposed to be very good for you...even better than green tea!?!?!
"I make my own ice tea every day--brew it using my coffee maker. My favorite combination is one Lipton Ice Tea Family Size Bag, with two of the Lipton Flavored tea bags. The Harvest Strawberry and Passion Fruit tea is by far the best. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores (and I live in Los Angeles!) I have no problem with caffeine, so the fact that the tea contains caffeine is a plus for me. At the same time, compared to the other flavored red and white teas Lipton makes, this particular blend has the least caffeine--only 13 grams per serving which is extremely low. I even occasionally brew it mixed with a decaf Ice Tea Family Size bag and drink it in the evening. It has a slightly more than subtle strawberry flavor that gives my ice tea a refreshing perk. I highly recommend this tea!"
"This tea is really delicious. I made sun tea with it, added fresh mint, put it in the sun all day and people who have had it raved. I would buy this tea again. Very refreshing. And the transparent pouches are so cute.<br /><br />Jill"
"I expected a burgundy-colored tea (taste and look comparable to Ridgeways Red Berry).<br /><br />Instead I got a dark tea with not much flavor.<br /><br />Can't taste whatever fruit is supposed to be in this.<br /><br />The pyramids are kind of cool, though."
"I'm not usually a tea drinker but the Lipton Pyramid Teas are so delightfully flavored that they could convert anyone....The Harvest Strawberry and Vanilla Caramel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1XW"">Lipton Black Tea, Vanilla Caramel Truffle, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> are my favorite but the others are very good too!!!!!<br />A MUST TRY!!!!!!!!"
a great alternative to plain tea when you want something a little different. this purchase was a fantastic deal. give it a try!!
"Honestly I'm not a tea drinker, but I love red tea when chilled. This tastes so good that you don't really notice the tea because the strawberry and passion fruit flavors pop out."
"Sure this tea has a mild fruity taste, but the cough syrup smell turns me off. I won't be buying it again."
"I tried this straight up 8 tea bags to a half gallon of water for iced tea...did NOT like it! Of course, I'd never tried roobios tea before, so what did I know? I tried it 4 bags of this Lipton tea and 4 bags of my Celestial Seasonings Morning Thunder (see link) and ...a new favorite is born. I love it like this with a packet and a half of Sweet-n-low...it's wonderful. If you have it and think it's no good, try mixing it with regular tea (or Morning Thunder)before getting rid of it. I haven't tried it hot, I suppose I'll do that next. But this is FL and I drink iced tea year round, so I'm always trying new tea.  :)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LOM"">Celestial Seasonings Black Tea, Morning Thunder, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
"great taste, great pice and the item arrived very fast.  I will without a doubt order again."
Our local grocery quit carrying our favorite tea for some unknown reason. We found it on Amazon and ordered with no problems. Great shipping and product arrived on time as promised.
It's excellent. Wonderful tea flavor. The tea pyramids never lose their shape.
This has been the only type of tea that I couldn't even tolerate to drink... donated to food drive... first time I or my husband have ever tried red tea... will never try again.
The tea was okay.  It didn't have as strong of a favor as I would have expected.
"......you don't get the stated amount.<br />In each box I have from the pack of 6, there wasn't 20 bags in any of them, best case 19, sometimes 18.<br />Also, in each box, there was at least 1 bag that wasn't properly sealed, and leaked it's contents all over, thereby reducing the effective count 1 or 2 per box.<br />You get roughly 16-18 good bags per box.<br />The secret for good iced tea from these bags is to fill a clean quart mason jar with water from a filtered pitcher like the brita pitcher, put the full mason jar (No lid, duh.) in the microwave until it boils, then drop in 2 or 3 bags. Leave it in the microwave, so nobody gets burned. Once the water cools enough for you to be able to touch the jar, screw on the top, and leave it on the counter, upside down. Leave the bags and all in the jar.<br />Once it's room temp, put it directly in the fridge. Leave the bags in the jar.<br />Put a thick glass tumbler in the freezer.<br />Leave it overnight.<br />When you're thirsty the next day, get the thick tumbler out of the freezer, fill it with ice, and fill it with the tea from the jar. Now take the bags out and throw them away.<br />Ahhhh....<br />This is good tea, but it needs to be steeped overnight for best taste, and you don't get 20 bags in the box. Don't say I didn't warn you."
"Don't buy these!!!  They're awful.  I bought these teas for my bridal shower.  We were going to serve tea.  When I got them they were not fresh at all.  Even after you brewed them there was no flavor or aroma.  I couldn't send them back because of the return policies, etc.  I had opened a box to see how they were.  I think there would've been a restocking fee too.<br /><br />You're better off getting these from the store."
I got this tea because it was about to expire and Amazon had it for a great price. The tea has a somewhat bitter taste but its not too powerful and it tends to be a great start - or end - of the day. I'd say its a bit expensive if your not buying from Warehouse Deals so I'd check there before making the purchase.
"When I first found Vermints, they were in smaller tins, in three flavors--Peppermint, Cinnamint and Wintermint.  This formula has sadly been discontinued and cannot be found in stores anymore.  When I saw VerMints were back, I was quite excited.  However, the Wintermint, my flavor, is not as strong as it used to be, and I'm terribly disappointed that Cinnamint has disappeared.  I would also appreciate a Spearmint flavor.  <p>That said, it's hard to find natural, vegan mints, and this one fits that bill nicely."
"Besides feeling like chaulk and not very wintergreen minty tasting the mints do last a bit longer than you would think.  The little pieces of fiber get on my nerves, too."
"These mints are the best I have ever had...  But I found out that Whole Foods Market near me carries them for less money and I don't have to buy by the case.  Of course, buying by the case is convienent so if they lower the price I'll start to buy them here again..."
"I saw VerMints in a natural food store and immediately noticed the adorable illustrations. Second, they made ""Wintermint"" which is not available in all types of mint-making brands. Especially not those which are Vegi/Vegan friendly.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much more wonderful this flavor was before it ""reappeared"" in public. Its a light flavor. Think of it at the opposite end of the spectrum of something ""curiously strong."" I'd like to think its ""gently minty.""<br /><br />I can't wait to try the other flavors and collect the adorable tins!"
"I don't know what product the other review is referring to, but this DOES have sugar, not malitol.<br /><br />I think this has the perfect balance of orange oil in it, not too strong, not too bland.  The regular 70% from this brand and the mint flavor are good too, but this is my favorite.<br /><br />And no soy lecithin either!"
I haven't spit food out of my mouth in a long time.  These things taste like urinal cakes.  *Expensive* urinal cakes.
I like this sugar free chocolate. It has 70% cocoa which is good for you and 70 calories per 2 squares it does have malitol so do not eat to much your you might not like the results! Nice taste and treat.
This coffee is great - a full-bodied flavor and is never bitter. Don't hesitate to order. I got on the saver plan and receive it every month.
"I've been drinking coffee for over 40 years, this is without a doubt the best flavored coffee out there on the market today. Wish I could buy it in larger bags."
"Great sausage.  But a little too much garlic for me.  The heat was ok.<br />but the snap and texture still makes it very good sausage.  I also like<br />a more vinegar taste,  but that was easily cured.  I'll  buy  more."
No at all disappointed. These sausages taste just as I remembered them from years ago. So glad I discovered them again.
"LOVE THEM,THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER...HARD TO FIND LIKE THIS..THEY SNAP WHEN YOU BITE THEM...NOT TO HOT AT ALL ..GO'S GOOD WITH A COLD ONE!!!...DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND THEM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CAN'T FIND THOSE OLD TIME BAR SNACKS!!!!!"
I am very pleased with the taste and smell of this tea. I even made it into iced tea which was very rich and good. I would recommend it to tea lovers.
"These Tastykake Sugar Free Chocolate Chocolate Chip Bars are a quite good tasting and only have 8g Net Carbs (21g Total - 3g Fiber - 10g Sugar Alcohol), making them a good choice for diabetics. The bars are also nicely filling, so you can eat just one and feel like you had a decent snack.<br /><br />These are sweetened with Maltitol, which does cause me some degree of ""gastric distress"" in larger quantities, but one bar seems to be tolerable. You might want to see how these effect you before heading out to a social event after eating one of these.<br /><br />I am very glad these are available in my area and enjoy them in moderation.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
Thank you for quick delivery and wonderful customer service on the Roland Balsamic Vinegar of Modena.  I really have enjoyed this Balsamic Vinegar on Salads.
Bought these at TJ maxx on a whim. They are wonderful! Just the right amount of sweetness and I love that the ingredient list is very simple.
These are simply the BEST - my favorite flavor of Chimes chews.  Perfect for a little sweet something and then some.  Mango and ginger - what's not to love?
"We decided to purchase direct from the company and save some money. In comparison pricing to other retailers, this was a good deal. Great throat lozenges and great for an alternative to bland mints and gum. Enjoy the mango/ginger flavour."
"I have a problem with most of these types of meal bars.  They tend to be chalky in texture and rather tasteless, or the taste they do have is artificial in flavor and comes across as `tasting healthy' or `tasting diet' and that is never a good thing.  To be honest, I'm not a gigantic fan of the other flavors Clif offers.  The chocolate ones all taste very much the same, and that solitary taste is not welcoming to me.  They don't taste awful (I've had much worse) but they aren't anything I'd rush out to eat again.<br /><br />These Oatmeal bars are a different story.<br /><br />Seriously, with the texture of a chewy cookie, this bar is satisfying in every sense of the word.  I love the size of these guys, perfectly suited for a breakfast on the go.  They taste just wonderful, lacking any and all chalky or artificialness reminiscent of most healthy bars.  Instead, you get an organic treat that doesn't skimp on the taste.  It's a great source of energy and nutrition too.<br /><br />As far as these things go, I've yet to have better!"
Pineapple Kool-Aid is THE best flavor hands down. This flavor is hard to find. I am glad Amazon.com carries it at a reasonable price.
"I've had this before, and it's always been a winner; pineapple Kool-Aid, something that's usually pretty difficult to find. Plus, when mixed in the right combination with Mandarin-Tangerine and simple Orange, makes a very good approximation of the long-discontinued ""Oh Yeah Orange-Pineapple"" Kool-Aid. Hey, manufacturer? You have my personal permission to bring *that* flavor back at any time, as well. :}"
"once in a while 'they' come out with a flavor that makes a great punch and all around beverage. this is one of those times. 3 packages of Pineapple Kool-aid, two and 1/2 cups sugar and 2 cups of Orange juice, really makes a nice punch for a hot day. good for freezer pops also. '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZEBMO"">Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Pina Pineapple Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.14-Ounce Envelopes (Pack of 96)</a><br /><br />I only wish they would bring back the kiwi-lime, that was awesome in a punch, like liquid Skiddles'"
"My gf and I did a taste test of these:<br />1) Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Mango Unsweetened (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZLUNC"">Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Mango Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.14-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>)<br />2) Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Pina Pineapple Unsweetened <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZEBMO"">Kool-Aid Aguas Frescas Pina Pineapple Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.14-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a><br />3) A 50/50 mix of the two.<br /><br />The color of Mango and Pineapple is very similar. The taste is similar too but Mango is better. A 50/50 mix of the two is better than any one alone.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets (1/2 cup) to make it sweeter."
"I was sceptical . . . but this one is a winner.  It even works (and works well) with Splenda (which not all Kool-Aid flavors do), for those calorie-conscious among us."
Simply the best kool aid drink ever.  I don't know why its not stocked and marketed.<br />Better than canada dry cactus coolers.
"Bought as one of 7 different flavors, and so far, very much my favorite.  Actually tastes pretty close to the real thing, though I tend to add a 1/2 packet of lemonade per 2liter as well, for a bit more kick."
"I love this flavor!  When I serve cold beverages using this pineapple flavor as one of the ingredients, my guests ooh and ahh, wondering how I produced the unique flavor.  This Kool-Aid flavor (not available in stores locally) is the secret, mixed with a non-bitter stevia sweetener, my home-brewed kombucha made from green tea, and various flavors (depending on the occasion) of brewed iced tea, with plenty of ice.  Sometimes I even carbonate the result, using a pressurized home carbonator."
"These carrots are so rich in color and I love being able to buy a case at a time and have them delivered to my door. Great taste, wonderful for soups and any other dish you would like to create. Cooking can be such fun and the color and taste of these carrots will add delight to any meal.."
"UPDATE 8/6/2012 Recent shipment to Amazon* which amounts to a 25% percent loss if just 3 cans are badly dented ........... Libby excellent products but until they stop sneaking these very badly dented cans thru to Amazon no more orders -<br /><br />>>Amazon great as always ... but here is the PROOF Libby's is processing dented cans to Amazon to unknowingly sell to consumer........... Every shipment to date has had dented cans - severely in some cases rendering product not edible per standards....this case of carrots had a can 'in the center' before they wrap to to send to Amazon warehouse. This can severely dented....BUT no marks on the wrapper - suggesting they re-wrapped before sealing to your warehouse for sale to Amazon customers ........<br /><br />Pity because we do like the quality & taste of most products - with some exceptions - as to quality - very first can had nasty carrot top end all black/rot maybe/ on top of can - having been thru Libby Canneries - was very surprised at this - but knowing the canning process knew it hadn't contaminated the product in the can......<br /><br />But will no longer be ordering any of these Libby canned good sales until they stop the sneaky tactics of sending dented cans - This proved that they are shipping this way  - in the grocery store it is a law - dented cans can not go on the shelves........<br />***********************************************<br />These are excellent in soups and stews or just plain heated up w/Basil [and butter]<br />An excellent 'evening' snack if one is watching their weight.<br /><br />If drained well, pass as salad topping."
The packaging was good. Not one can damaged. They taste great and they're cheaper then on sale in the grocery store. I love subscribe & save!
"This case of Libby's carrots arrived in good shape; the case of cans itself was shrink wrapped in plastic plus packing material to protect the case in the packing box. However, the cans in the CENTER of the case were severely dented. The cans on the exterior were perfect. This occurred with 5 cases of different Libby's vegetables. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who did this. Guess Libby's packers were instructed to slip the damaged ones in the center; even if you saw this case displayed in a store you would never know till you paid for them & opened them up, & then it's too late. Amazon has been great about this issue, but the fault was not Amazon's, it is clearly Libby's. The carrots are fine but I took off a star for Libby's sneaky practice & for paying for 12 cans and having to throw out 4. What a disgrace. If this happens to you,  call & let them know; it is totally unacceptable."
"These are the olives that I used to get in a restaurant in the Netherlands of all places. We would literally go through bowlfuls of them before and after our dinner had arrived. They are firm with just the right amount of salty bite. SO delicious!  But be warned, they have the pits in them as all true olives do. I'm really happy that they are available on Amazon, because they are very difficult to find."
"These bars are terrific.....very moist unlike many other snack bars.  They are quite tastey and my kids really like them, too."
"nutritious soft & delicious organic, zero trans fats ,whole grain & Hemp<br /><br />For fiber omega 3's and some protein ---we just love em!!"
"One thing that annoys me is hearing someone eat while I'm nearby studying.  These are wonderful in so many ways, and they are quiet.  I'm Vegan so buying food on campus means I get to eat an apple--I don't like apples.  These however are very good and easy to throw a few in my book bag.  They taste just as good smashed as they do when in form.  I suggest packing a bottle of water along with them.  enjoy!"
The granola bars are perfect. I like to always have snacks like this on hand so I can fill up on healthy stuff instead of stopping for garbage / fast food.<br /><br />Hemp is a real super food - my only qualm would be that there isn't enough hemp seed in these.
"These are definitely the best granola bars I've tasted.  Instead of being a dry texture like most other bars, they are more like Rice Crispy treats.  Great to take anywhere for a snack, quick pick-me-up, or lunch treat.  And nutritious!"
"My son is an extremely picky eater, but he could live on these things.  Easy to throw into the backpack for school."
"It is so hard to get him to eat anything organic or healthy, but he loves these!"
"The best granola bars that we have eaten so far.  Chewy, and very tasty.. it does not feel like you are eating bland cardboard. My kids love them!"
These are great.  I wanted more hemp in my diet.  These taste great and make a great substitute for candy at work.
"My kids and I love these bars.  We snack on them when we are out and about.  They are wonderful - moist, delicious, and all around a great snacking bar."
"Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Amazon page.<br /><br />Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all."
"I am truly in love with this sauce. It's the right balance of heat and garic. Any dish is awoken with just a dab of this sauce. Chicken,steak,seafoods and pork dishes, go very well with it. I wish there were more places to purchase it from. Until them amazon is my go to place"
"This wine tastes and smells like vinegar.  I wanted it to be good because I really like Bethenny, but it just isn't.  It's really bad."
"I am a pretty low key wine drinker that tends to like light, crisp and fruity wines. This rose is just that! Good job Bethenny!"
These are just about the right size for a 65 lb. doggie.  Looks like they are made in U.S.A. from quality stuff.
"This is a wonderful, rich sauce. You can taste the capers and olives. Nothing like the supermarket sauces. Price seems high but you can serve 4 as a side."
"Since I was a kid I always loved eating this candy. But when I moved to a city that didn't sell these, I was devastated. Just a few days ago I recently came across one of these from a friend and have fallen in love with them all over again. I decided to look online for this candy and voila! I can't get enough of them! My all-time absolute favorite Mexican candy, and even possibly my favorite candy period!"
I grew up adoring mexican candy and always loved it. I can't help but be addicted to these!  Hawaii certainly doesn't have them.
Perfect amount of spice tart and sweetness.If you do not like spicy candy this is not for you lol. For some reason it keeps saying my review is too short....So I am going to just ramble on about how delicious this candy is. It is so delicious it made me want to have a snowball fight with a polar bear.
"I absolutely love this candy. The best mexican candy ever & they arrived at my house FAST with Prime, i have to order more!"
"I started eating these little pieces of heaven when I was in 7th grade. I fell in love with them. Though it's hard for me to find them around town and also, my mom isn't big about buying me candy. Though since I am able to order them online and pay for them myself, I can actually get them. I am so excited about having these babies sent to my house. They're just so delicious!"
"I live in MS, so its difficult to find the candy that i grew up with in San Diego. I love this candy."
The candy is just as I remembered it as a kid. The candy is really good but be very careful it has citric acid. This candy is cheap but comes at a expensive price towards your teeth. Citric acid lingering in your mouth for awhile causes damage to your teeth. Brush after eating candy!
"Item is described as ""hard caramel candy with a soft & spicy candy center."" The outside tastes the same to me as the inside: spicy candy. I don't taste any caramel. I was expecting something sweet outside, spicy inside. Instead it's spicy outside, spicy inside."
"This is the best home-brewed coffee i've ever tasted.  I know of a few places in Rome that make a better brew, but I can get there only every few years."
"I have tried literally hundreds of commercial espresso coffees over the years. Far and away, this has always been the best in my view. Rich, dark, not bitter, wonderful aroma. Maybe I am immune to caffeine, but Medaglia D'Oro does not make me jittery, ever. I order this in case my supermarket runs out. Much better than Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts."
"I don't know what it is about this specific variety of espresso, but everytime I make a latte with it, I get a jittery caffeine high from it.  It's strange - Other varieties of dark roasted bean don't have this much of an effect on me.  I've joked with co-workers that the company must be adding extra caffeine to the product.  Who knows?"
"IF YOU CAN'T GET IT FRESH, SIMPLY ORGANIC IS THE WAY TO GO, GREAT SPICE...."
"We bought a four-pack of 10-ounce Milton's Multi-Grain Crackers for a Christmas party. Everyone who tried them liked them. However, we ended up with three of the four packs left over. Tough break! I love these things! I use them as a late night snack while watching TV. I add them to my noon lunch at work. I use them for improvised lunches when I don't feel like cooking anything. They're delicious. Very tasty. And I love the crunchy, somewhat gritty texture which goes along with the excellent flavor. Plus, they're mostly whole grain. What more could you ask?<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"Crackers arrive fresh and whole.  Good for scooping up dips, breaking into soup or plain munching.  Also has very nice ingredients.  Highly recommended."
"These crackers are the very best crackers that we have ever had.  Taste, texture and flavor exceed any other cracker product that we have sampled.  They are truly the best of the best.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OOYNDG"">Milton's All Natural Multi-Grain Crackers, 4 10oz trays per box</a>"
"I so love these crackers. I have tried several varieties of other crackers and never found one I like as much as these. They are a little more expensive, but truly worth it. Will definately order again. It has been a challenge to find these."
"MILTON'S CRACKERS ARE GREAT. THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT SUC A LARGE QUANTITY. HOWEVER AT MY LOCAL COSTCO, THEY WERE $6.00 WHICH MAKES THIS PRICE two and a half times as much- plus shipping.<br />never again.<br />anita"
We enjoy these crackers so much we are willing to order them on line as there is no where else we can buy them in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
"I used to buy this product at Costco but they quit carrying it.  I liked it so much I started a search and then thought ""Amazon"".  Sure enough there they were, only 5 were left; I bought 3.  I hope Amazon restocks because I will have to find them somewhere. They are so good and have become one of my favorite snacks just by themselves--nothing on them.  Try them; you'll like them!"
"These are seriously the best multi grain crackers ever, but have become hard to find at my local area stores.  Thank goodness I can still get them on Amazon.  Try them - you will not be disappointed."
Taste is not acceptable and shipping cost from overseas very high. Wife is English and says the present product is not the same as what it used to be.
"I like pinot this even better than the Wilamette Valley Castle Rock that I usually buy at Trader Joe's for ~10 bucks a bottle.  I think I picked this bottle up at Cost Plus World Market for about the same.  It's smooth and very drinkable--I'm not too keen on describing wines by comparing it to fruits and whatnot, so I'm not going to :)"
"I had the absolute PLEASURE of trying this at a friend's house today. I'm ordering a pack of 6! We both usually get the Melitta Love at First Sip because it tastes/smells so fresh from its foilwrap, but it's been out of stock and truthfully comes out a little bit week for a medium roast.  This stuff, on the other hand, comes out aromatic and flavorful without the burnt tast of a dark roast! It makes you want to inhale through your nose as you sip-- yum!!  I can't wait to get my boxes :)"
"I don't know what Java One is doing, but they're managing to put good coffee in defective pods.  On my last shipment, at least one out of five pods were not sealed...you open the envelope and there is loose coffee all over.  The edges of the pods are open.  This is NOT due to our opening them incorrectly.  The filter paper is not ripped or damaged, it just isn't glued or sealed properly.  Definitely not recommended to buy these unless you want to waste about 15% of your money.  Other than that, I like the coffee itself (when it stays in the pod)."
"Nov 2010: Still love this coffee!  I just signed up for monthly shipments, having run out last month and been forced to go back to the Senseo brand pods. Yuck!  Well, they are OK until you've been spoiled by these.  With the monthly shipments, the price comes down to a few cents over $20 bucks a pack and *FREE SHIPPING*!  How can you go wrong with that?<br /><br />I only wish they had a nice sampler pack with maybe 3 varieties of pod and that they would add Ethiopian Yrgichieffe as a flavor.  That's one of my favs.  So what if it's hard to pronounce?  It's great coffee!<br /><br />Original review:<br />Some of the other reviews and other similar items had me very confused as to what I should buy (or even if I should just keep buying Senseo-brand pods at the grocery store).  So, I took a chance with one order to see what I'd get.<br /><br />First thing to say is that the coffee is delicious.  I am so tired of only having a limited choice of flavors with the supermarket brands.  Even the supposed premium varieties leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The Sumatra Mandheling pods from Java One taste great!  Not only are they a nice change for me, but the quality is excellent.  Each pod is individually sealed in a pouch and one order contains 14 pods per box, with 6 boxes in a case.  That is 84 pods total at a cost of about 23 cents per pod.<br /><br />The box says that each pod is good for an 8-ounce cup, so that's how I prepared my coffee.  I have a large 16-oz mug and normally would use 3 pods of the Senseo brand (one double-pod holder that I run on both size settings and one single-pod holder that I only run once at the larger cup size).  Doing that fills my mug about 3/4 of the way and leaves room for cream, plus some dead space above.<br /><br />With these pods, I used the single-pod holder and only the large-cup setting, but ran it twice, changing the pod in between (are you following me?).<br /><br />That filled my mug almost up to the top, leaving just enough space for my cream.<br /><br />The coffee was among the best I have made, ever.<br /><br />So, not only is each pod only 23c, but I only have to use 2 pods (46c) to make what used to require 3 of them (at an approximate cost of 29c each or 87c for my mug) to get the taste I wanted."
"As a disclaimer, I have a Senseo coffee pod machine, so of course the Senseo pods fit quite well.  The problem with these pods is that they are not advertised for a specific machine but don't fit the Senseo machines.  I've purchased all sorts of different pods to get different flavors or varieties that have fit the Senseo machine just fine, so why can't Java One make pods that fit?  The pods are really good tasting (er' I mean the coffee in them..) but if you use them with the Senseo they actually become dangerous, breaking the lid seal and popping the top of the machine thus spraying hot water everywhere.<br /><br />So, Senseo owners, seek elsewhere."
"These are OK, but not great.  I'm not super impressed with the flavor.  If you're considering these for your Senseo machine, be aware that you really need to pack and flatten the pods in to get them to fit without leaks.  They're just a little bit too thick."
Not just a wonderful coffee for the price.... just a wonderful coffee! Individually sealed pods for half the price!
I'm lazy about making my morning coffee so using the pods works great! I'm a bit of a coffee snob so I was surprised that I liked this stuff. Very dark and rich.
We've been drinking this coffee for over a year now.  It has a strong flavor what is very enjoyable.  Usually pod coffee is weak and boring but not this one!  The subscription has been perfect and oh so helpful.  We never run out of coffee anymore!
"I have tried a number of Senseo pods, and this is my favorite.  It is very smooth.  It tastes like coffee from a coffee house (rather than a Senseo)."
I love the sumatra coffee pods but I do think that Java One has changed the blend. The pods now read sumatra and not sumatra mandheling. I don't think they have the same taste but are still good. After I finish these though I will search out and see if there are other sumutra blends that compare with the previous blend that Java One had.
"I liked this soup a lot! However, I was able to find one from another brad that is much better tasting. I won't advertise it here, but just saying: for my taste this was not the perfect one, although, it's really yummy. What I also disliked about this one is that it's condensed. I rather use one that I don't have to add anything to - just warm it up and eat. Yum."
"I have used it many times and the flavor is wonderful. I highly recommend it, it is free of processed sugars and flours. I sauteed chicken in a little organic cold-pressed extra virgin coconut oil and added a little punjabi garam masala, I added the soup mix and I used So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk for the liquid. I served it over brown rice, my family LOVED it!  I have used it in other dishes as well, and am planning to use it in tuna casserole."
"Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I start mine with a 'Smoothie',containing wheatgrass as a base, and then add fresh fruit,(your choice), flaxseed, fresh spinach and 1- 1/2 cups of POM juice. Blend and enjoy. I do not add ice...I drink it at room temperature...the choice is yours again..add or not to add ice. There's something about the wheatgrass that not only tastes good, but I know what it does for the body! Good stuff! Try: 1 cup of 2% milk, 1 lg. scoop vanilla ice cream and 1 lg. scoop of wheatgrass...mix in blender and drink. En-er-GEE, soooooo good!!"
"I purchased this to use in baking according to Elana's website. She stated the oil has a buttery taste. This oil has a taste that I cannot describe it overpowers the chocolate chip cookies. It might be this brand, maybe I will try another brand of grapeseed oil."
This is the second time I've ordered the 4 pack of this coffee while on deploymen to Afghanistan.  Brewed in just a regular cheap drip coffee maker this coffee is outstanding!!!  I will order this on a recurring basis once I return to the states!! YUM!
"Lavazza coffee is the best coffee ever, we love it, every pot brews up so smooth even when brewed very strong."
"The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee."
"We love good coffee, but are not experts by any means. After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!"
"My wife and I love this Italian coffee since we practically grew up with it...<br />Out of the 4 in the pack, one of the bricks had lost its pressure but it still brewed greatly.<br />The order arrived promptly and met expectation like the service provided.<br />Thank you,<br />M. & G."
"Best Italian expresso coffee ever! It is a MUST to keep on hand and best served after dinner. Smooth, frothy, and never bitter."
"I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware."
This is my favorite coffee. I use it in my bialetti and it makes great espresso. Full and rich flavor. Somewhat hard to find in stores so u always buy on amazon.
"This is an affordable and good coffee for my Gaggia Expresso machine. Good aroma, taste and price. I also like Illy, but the cost-benefit on the Lavazza is better... strongly recommend to all."
I love this stuff. Very smooth and rich. It is great to mix half and half with milk and just a little bit of sugar
"others with a more 'soFISTicated' palet say its just OK. its fine on my taste buds and thats all that counts.  not too pricey, good aroma, good foam, all in all a good cup of espresso.<br /><br />nuff said."
What can I say more than in the title!! This is very good coffee. Every morning I enjoy my Cappucino!
"Very good product, the price is fair. Fast shipping.I recommend to people who love coffee or espresso. Real italian taste. Enjoy it."
We make this every morning in our espresso machine. It is delicious. Definitely the way to go if you drink espresso every day.
Highly recommend w/ the AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker. Great coffee because of the taste and the aroma. Fast Shipment.
"This coffee is so delicious--very smooth, with hints of mocha. It makes the most amazing cappuccino, too. With cream and sugar, this coffee is simply amazing. I purposely seek coffee shops that sell this brand of coffee because it is so delicious. Anytime I try other brands of coffee, I'm disappointed because it doesn't compare to the Lavazza brand of coffees. Buy it!"
This brings me back to the time I spent in Europe. Better than any coffee at the supermarket for basically the same price. A no brainer here folks.
"WOW! Just WOW! I am telling you, coming from being a complete coffee noob to drinking this stuff using a Bialetti Mokka pot, I am just in complete aw!<br />Coffee can really be this good???<br />So smooth, clean pure. Not bitter or blah. Absolute coffee perfection.<br /><br />If you are looking to take your coffee drinking experience to the next level, do yourself a favor and grab this and a Bialetti <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK"">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and let the mornings come in multitude!<br /><br />Yehaw I feel great!!!!!!"
Having tried many different ground coffee for my espresso maker this one is rich and tasty.<br />Where it really stands out for me and my family is there is no bitter taste that is present in a lot of other coffee we have tried.
not okay for a drip coffee.  this fine grind does not work well in my drip machine and 3 out of 4 bricks arrived compressed and one not.<br />will not buy again but will work for a one time deal.
"Strong, little bitter, but don't have a rich coffee flavor. You can find the same flavor on supermarket less value, Pilon, Bustelo, etc."
"My review is pretty much in the title. The coffee itself was fantastic. Great flavor and I highly recommend it for any coffee lovers out there.<br />The only trouble I had was in the shipping. One of the vacuum sealed bricks had been compromised with a slice in the side of it.<br />Nevertheless, the coffee was still useable in my opinion."
Bought this on a whim as I don't drink much coffee.  But I love starbucks like drinks.  Used in conjunction with my aerobie aeropress http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1326377612&sr=8-4<br /><br />The results were fantastic.  The espresso that I made was awesome full and rich flavor.  Threw in a couple splashes of 2% milk and a couple of splendas and some ice cubes and it was better than the starbucks drinks no joke.  Next time I'll throw in a splash of chocolate syrup! Can't wait.  I love Lavazza!
"Guys:<br />Although the price recently went up, I received this 4-pack for $12 shipped (using Subscribe and Save and an Amazon clipless coupon).  Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I"">Ne-Cap Nespresso® Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),"
"My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands. This Creme e Gusto is superb (for a pre-ground). We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price."
I love it!<br />Exactly like a perfect italian espresso coffee should be.<br />It's great for making a real italian cappuccino too!<br />You'll love it.
"I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways."
"A super fine grind that we find works perfectly in our espresso machine. Our decent grinder can't get it this fine and this produces great crema. The taste is nice and bold, and we love using drinking a couple shots of espresso with a couple tablespoons of condensed milk."
I love this coffee! It's so super smooth and yummy. I make it in my French press every Sunday morning. Highly recommended! I get it on subscription from amazon and the price is really great! Cheaper then the supermarket and I don't have to do a thing!
"I've tried just about anything when it comes to ground coffee for espresso machines, and nothing comes close to this Lavazza. I've been ordering it regularly for over a year now, and am very happy with it. It makes an espresso rich in taste and smell, with a pleasant hint of chocolate flavor (you can barely notice it). It certainly helps me start my day the right way!"
We love Crema e Gusto for breakfast. It has the smooth and intense flavor of the coffee in Europe; no bitter or over roasted. There is nothing better.
"LOVE THIS ESPRESSO, NEVER BITTER HAS A LIGHTER TASTE BUT IS TERRIFIC TASTING,I MAKE MY CAPPICCINO EVERY MORNING.NOT A DARK BLEND."
"Using Lavazza Crema Gusto in my Moka is like being back in Italy. It makes a great cup of cappucino, without which I cannot start my day.  Rich flavor, strongly roasted but not burnt tasting.  The vacuum package keeps it very fresh."
"The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good."
Amazing espresso coffee! I strongly advise anyone who as the passion for espresso coffee to buy this brand! Although once in a while due to the packaging the bricks come with small holes making it loose it's freshness and vacuum properties...<br />Besides this small problem it's definitely the best espresso coffee you can get in America!!!
"After spending almost $5.00 a day for months at Starbucks on iced lattes with an extra shot, I finally got wise and did some research on Amazon. After purchasing an espresso maker, I had to find a quality espresso to go along with it. The description is 100% accurate. Smooth and not bitter. This is the best espresso I have ever tasted. Thank goodness I can order it from Amazon."
"I recently bought an espresso maker  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002A3S66"">De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>  which I love, and wanted some good coffee to go with it.  Originally I was going to buy the illy espresso, but I saw this and it's cheaper and got great reviews, which are definitely well-deserved.  It's so delicious and I love the smell of the coffee - it's chocolaty.  MMMmmmmmmm."
"I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao"
I always buy Lavazza coffee. It has such a smooth taste and is a great value for the quality. I use Crema e Gusto with my Bialetti caffettiera and with my Breville espresso/cappuccino maker. I always get a lot of crema when I use this with my Breville machine. I've tried other brands but I always go back to Lavazza.
"We're not really coffee experts, but have tried a few brands/roasts. This Lavazza Crema e Gusto has to be the best cup of coffee I've had. We've only used it in our drip maker so far, but will give it a try in our pump espresso maker soon. Yum, and highly recommended."
"I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see."
I first discovered this coffee while in Italy and was so happy to find it here.  It does have that chocolate underlay.  I typcally make a latte with it and have found it to make a perfect cup in my moka pot.
"This coffee is great for espresso machines, but is a little weak in drip makers. Adding a little extra makes it great."
"I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived."
This coffee is soooooo smooth and flavorful - I absolutely love it! This coffee is so incredible you will never enjoy another brand again.
"This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite."
"I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!"
I make coffee and espresso from Lavazza Crema e Gusto every morning. My friends love my coffee and Lavazza made with spring water is my secret.
"I have always enjoyed this product and routinely order it from Amazon.  Thank you for stocking<br />it, for it is hard to find."
"I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!"
I am not a coffee connoisseur. I just wanted a cup of coffee that did not need tons of milk and sugar to cover the charred taste. Lavazza greatly surpassed my expectations. Now to get my hands on a Bialetti and begin my quest for the perfect cappuccino...
"You can't go wrong with this [[ASIN:B001E5E0D8 Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4).  Nice espresso flavor, naturally sweet and mild.  It's our favorite everyday espresso  for  morning lattes or an occasional Americano, a nice consistent crema.  And really, you can't beat the Subscribe and Save Program!!  We've tried Lavazza Blu (a chocolate taste) and came back to this.<br /><br />After opening the vacuum sealed package, I transfer the ground espresso to a French (clip top)mason jar, and store in the refrigerator as recommended by the company.  I take out just enough for our two shots and put the jar right back into the fridge--it stays tasting fresh to the last cuppa:~)Delicious!!"
"taste is amazing! not bitter at all, best espresso coffee I have tried (still haven't tried Illy though) I would definitely reccomend this for anyone who loves a good strong cup of coffee. well worth the money."
"Great espresso coffee. I own Breville espresso coffee machine and this coffee is perfect... not too core, not too fine. Taste is bold, chocolaty but not overwhelming to the palette. Love it."
"This is by far my favorite coffee.  I used it continuously when living in Europe and am so glad to have found it on Amazon at a reasonable price.<br /><br />It is strong but very mellow.  No bitter aftertaste, and makes the first cup of coffee worthwhile getting up for.<br /><br />Please continue to make favorable price offers on this item and I promise I will continue ordering."
"If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks. This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste. Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked. If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt&eacute;'s, the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />John S."
"I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee."
"The best espresso money can buy. I use to like SegaFredo brand, but La Vazza crema e gusto is way ahead. It is very creamy, nice looking and smooth."
"it is really good coffee, my italian friend recommended this product!!<br /><br />and i tried... and.... i like it so much... i ordered 8 bags..."
"I am not an expert but this espresso is to die for. Perfect each time from my machine. No bitterness, but strong."
"I buy this coffee regularly from Amazon. It is smooth, full flavored, and not bitter. I love the free shipping as stores around my house are often out of it and charge more anyway. It deserves 5 stars for sure. I buy several 4 packs at a time or have purchased the case of 20. I never want to run out- it's a gourmet staple in my house and my whole family loves it."
"This is my favorite coffee outside of Italy. It is the only brand my husband and I drink. We can't drink drip coffee anymore because it tastes so terrible compared to the Lavazza. If you are a coffee lover this is a great product, and you will LOVE it. My friends always come over for a Latte! Like the name, it is creamy with lots of flavor!"
"We love this coffee and have looked everywhere for better prices, but amazon is the lowest."
"This espresso is amazing. My wife would not drink coffee until she had this product, now she has Lavazza espresso every day. Crema e gusto tastes wondeful, try it and you'll love it."
"Lavazza Crema E Gusto together with my Saeco home expresso maker, produces the best flavor and richest crema of any expresso I have ever had."
We have been using this for almost a year now and having a subscription order really makes the coffee a good buy besides having such a great expresso taste.
"Using this coffee and a stove top espresso maker (a ""moka"") I make the best espresso, my husband and I like our home coffee better than what we can get at Starbucks or any of the other coffee shops."
"It's my favorite for over 10 years. Living both in Europe and US brew it in at least 4 different espresso machined, always perfect result. I and my wife absolutely love it! Highly recommend!"
i use this for a stovetop espresso coffee maker and it works<br />great and the taste is nice and smooth.  All lavazza coffees<br />are extremely good.
This coffee is lack of body and lack of aroma.  It is not worth the money at all.  Do not waste your money and time.
"Had to use twice as much of this as Medaglia D Oro to obtain the same strength. If you like Columbian, then maybe this is for you."
"I drink this coffee daily and I love it!<br />I am Italian and I know  Lavazza very well, that's the only coffee my family and I drink. If you are expecting a weak taste like the normal american coffee, do not buy this kind.<br />The flavor is strong, just like coffee should be.<br />I would raccomand to make it with of those italian coffee machines like Bialetti."
"We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure. Flavor is full and robust, but not at all bitter. It's hard to describe it's smoothness without hyperbole, but try it once and you'll find yourself at a loss for words also. If you are used to the strength of a French press but want the silky smoothness of a breakfast blend, this coffee is for you.<br /><br />Vacuum packed into foil bricks for freshness. Do yourself, your spouse, and your office mates a huge favor and give it a try - and be prepared to start writing your own five star review."
This is a great product at a great price.  Works very well in our espresso machine.  We both have a double shot latte every morning.  Order this on a recurring basis so we never run out.
"Lavazza crema e gusto is the best coffee. When you sip it, you can really tell that it has the true flavor of a good coffee.  I have it used for at least 20 years. My day is not the same, if I do not use my Lavazza Crema e Gusto Coffee. I can taste the difference between this coffee and the quality of other coffees. It has become our ritual for my husband and I to have an ""Espressiata"" as he calls it before he goes to work. This coffee makes my day. Mary Ann Vitale"
"one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office."
Works well with my Espresso machine. Tastes great. No other retailer can beat this price. Will definitely recommend this product.
This is pretty powerful coffee so I mix one brick with one pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  The combo of this potent Lavazza brew with the more bland DD joe is Dy-No-Mite!
"I ordered after reading all the reviews here.First time I made, I was hooked.Now its been 2 years.<br /><br />You need the right tools/steps to get the perfect taste though.<br /><br />1.Use a Bialetti espresso maker,if you can.<br />2.Don't stuff the filter all the way up,if you are making one cup only.<br />3.If you like milk with it, I suggest shaking the milk in a bottle, till it becomes frothy(you can use a milk frother as well,but just more cleaning etc.) and then add it on top, the flavour is completely different as compared to just pouring the milk in.<br />4.Enjoy."
"I love this espresso!  I never thought I would say it, but I think I like it more than Starbucks!  If you haven't given it a shot yet, do.  You won't be disappointed."
This coffee  is strong without being bitter or acidic. It has a smooth taste with some lovely fruity afternotes. I would purchase this again. Usually I prefer to grind my own. But this vacuum packed coffee was very fresh. I love  this Lavazza much better than Starbucks and Seattles best.
"I purchased this to go make with my Bialetti Espresso pot. It is so smooth and rich, holds up extremely well to steamed milk. Much better than the espressos found in supermarkets.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D154I"">Bialetti Cappuccino and Latte Set</a>"
I bought this coffee for my Bialetti Cappuccino and Latte Set which are equally Great!!!  I have this coffee coming every 3 months which saves a few dollars on the price.  The coffee is Delicious!!!
"It is not have a bitter taste as a few have suggested.  I always use a melitta cup for making any espresso coffee and this one is just delicious.  I checked my ph strip and it does not register as acid.  It doesn't bother my stomach at all and I am super sensitive to anything acid.  American coffee I have a hard time tolerating; the Italian and Kenya coffees that are dark roast espresso are thought by some people via their processing techniques and quality to be alkaline.  It makes the American coffee look like junk for how the body responds and the taste. Once you have had this coffee you won't want American coffee anymore.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering what a melitta cup is, it is a cone made from plastic or ceramic (mine is ceramic) and it has a hole at the bottom.  I adjust the coffee filter to fit it and then put the espress coffee in it and then pour my hot water from the tea kettle into it.  I add a little nut milk into the coffee and I am ready to enjoy a wonderful taste.  It beats dealing with a coffee maker any day.  Each person in the family can have their own melitta cup as it is so quick to do."
"This is probably some of the best coffee I've had, even though it's pre-ground that doesn't seem to matter. Keep it up guys !!"
No bitter test even though it makes a strong cup of coffee. Rich and Creamy. will buy again as soon as Amazon start selling it not through the third party.
"The tastiest espresso is yielded from Crema E Gusto. A nice chocolate undertone.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
"I have been looking for a really good Expresso coffee and  I finally found it. I used this in my regular Mr. Coffee maker and it was very good, I also used it in my travel and my 2 to go maker and still it did not loose it's flavor. Tip, try it with Coffeemate Italian Sweet Cream for a quick latte. Can't wait to use it with an expresso machine."
"This coffee is ground too coarsely to make decent espresso in either of my two Capresso machines.  I filled the portafilter to the top and tamped as hard as I could, but when I brew the water runs through the filter way too fast.  I get about 3 oz. of coffee in 10 seconds instead the ideal 1 oz. in 25 seconds.  This results in strong coffee instead of actual espresso.  I've tried to make this as regular coffee in a french press as well, but the 70% robusto bean in the blend makes for a pretty bland cup of coffee."
I know what other reviewers mean when they say it tasted like Folgers.  It was OK but definitely not e Gusto. It was a good deal for the price. I forgot what I paid but I know it was on sale.
"I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds."
"Going by many of the reviews, I decided to give this Lavaza crema coffee a try. People that compare it to Illy are very wrong, this is nothing like Illy, it is bitter and with a strong chocolate flavor, which i don't care for in coffee. the price is not bad if you try it and like it. Not for my taste."
After reading all the hype I was lured in to buying this so-called coffee.  Tastes like coffee grind recycled after first use.  The coffee we buy from local super market costs the same but tastes much better.
This espresso makes great crema with it's 70% robusta blend.  The aroma and flavor match that of some single origin arabica shots I've had as well.
deployed in the military doesn't always mean you need to miss out on the finer things in life. Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it. I was able to snag this for 3 bucks a brick. This is some smooth and great tasting coffee. The taste going down your throat is amazing and when we open a new vacuum sealed bag we both take a big whiff of that great ground coffee smell. It makes a pretty strong cup of joe(caffeine too) and not for that bad of a price. Our bags don't expire until the end of 2012 but we don't have to worry about that since we are on our third bag already... this won't replace our regular brands but is a good change. thanks to amazon for shipping this to us.
Great tasting coffee. I use this in a plunger and it makes nice strong tasting coffee similar to an espresso machine. I would def purchase this again.
"My absolute favorite. So smooth and not bitter at all.  With cream and sugar it tastes like premium coffee ice cream.  I use it in my small drip coffee maker, because I'm usually too busy to make with the espresso maker.  It tastes the same either way, just with less water.<br /><br />My only issue with it is that after drinking it every day for six months I developed heart palpitations. I previously was not a daily coffee drinker, so that probably has something to do with it, but I am only in my early thirties. They don't make a decaf version, and I have yet to find one that tastes as smooth.  So now it's only for special occasions, never days in a row.<br /><br />So if you are sure your heart is VERY healthy (I thought mine was before I had issues), go for it.  But tread lightly, and be sure to keep well hydrated."
Tried this based on positive reviews. Very disappointed. Just slightly better(and more expensive) than grocery store coffee. Lavazza should be sued for false advertising for putting the word gusto on the package! I will go sprinting back to my BOLD Starbucks and happily pay the modest difference!
"This is one more coffee on my quest for a perfect coffee. It's got the strong, dark flavor I want, but it has a bitter undertone that I do not want. If it had no bitter undertone, it would be the perfect coffee. However, it has to settle for merely being very good coffee."
This is the best Coffee And the only one i drink. i get delivered  to my home every month try it!
"Lavazza is a great Italian brand name and the Crema e Gusto blend is a fairly new introduction to the Lavazza catalog. I first tried the Crema e Gusto in Europe and quickly became addicted! I packed my suitcase full when I came home and it was worth the effort. All of the Lavazza blends are excellent, but this blend is particularly special- it is very smooth and rich with virtually no bitterness at all. I brew it in a stove-top espresso maker and it's absolutely perfect every time."
Excellent coffee product.  Bought for my espresso maker but also use in my drip coffee maker and is great either way.
"One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste. No bitterness at all. Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word ""Crema"" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that's with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The ""Flavor"" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee."
"I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G"">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee."
"I purchased this to use with my Bialetti Moka, and it is delicious!<br /><br />I like to use 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons in my 6-cup maker, and it makes enough for two (large) lattes.<br /><br />It reminds me of working in Starbucks...that smell of delicious brewing coffee and espresso!<br /><br />(Unlike Starbucks coffee, however, this coffee is smooth and doesn't taste burnt at all.)<br /><br />The packaging was a bit smaller than expected, but a little sure goes a long way!"
"I drink espresso (moka) daily, and go through a 250g/8.8oz brick in about 2 weeks. In my opinion, this isn't the greatest blend from Lavazza that I've had, but it's not the worst coffee I've had either (it definitely beats the drip coffee I'd otherwise get at work). It's a 70/30 robusta/arabica blend, a dark roast with a fruity though noticeably bitter finish (but not as bad as Starbucks or Peet's coffee). The Lavazza Espresso (black tin, 100% arabica claimed) tastes better than this blend, but after having tried Illy's moka grind, the different blends from Lavazza, Kimbo, Segafredo, and also blends from the local coffee roasters, I actually think that a robusta/arabica blend works best for a moka pot; just not this one. Overall, I'd say that I got what I paid for, but I didn't get what I wanted and I was seduced by the 93 or so 4/5 star reviews for this coffee. I'd really give it a 2.5 or 3 but then again, all taste is subjective, That being said, this is a reasonable coffee (considering taste vs. price), but I'll probably switch back to my regular (and unfortunately more expensive) blend."
"We have a semi-automatic espresso maker and this is what goes in it.  Amazing flavor, no bitter undertones at all, beats the local coffee houses' espresso (which was unexpected for pre-ground).  5 stars!"
"I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The ""creaminess"" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup."
"I purchased this along with the espresso in the can.<br />I've mixed the two in equal amounts.<br />We're very pleased with the coffee.<br />It's not bitter or acidic, but still rich tasting."
"I was not as impressed as the other reviewers.  If you are reading this and are used to freshly ground coffee every morning, please don't buy this.  After reading the glowing reviews, I thought I could skimp a little and save a few bucks over my current coffee, but I found it simply isn't worth it."
"I bought this based on other reviews, it was good, but not as spectacular as they suggested."
"If this is what ""good"" coffee is supposed to taste like, no thanks!!! To me, it's weak and pretty much flavorless. Safeway and Winco store brands, in my opinion, are much better."
"Is this variety ground fine for espresso machines?  I am confused because it says, ""ground coffee""  but also, ""espresso.""  TIA!"
"I was misled by the high reviews of this coffe (somehow I forgot that we are in Folgers land here) so I bought a 4-pack. This coffee tastes awfully like robusta, and probably is made moustly out of robusta (interested parties can inquire about robusta vs arabica in the coffee blends, but let's just say that any decent coffee blend is made out of 100% arabica. Robusta is mixed in cheap blends because it is cheap. Tastes awful too... ). Also, the price of this coffe does not reflect the low quality - it should be way cheaper.<br />I normally buy Lavazza Oro, but somehow the quality of that coffee deteriorated in the last year or so)."
"I have been looking for a good substitute for a morning McDonalds Mocha (which I had officially become addicted to). I brew this in my travel mug coffee maker, add some milk, french vanilla liquid creamer, equal, a bit of chocolate syrup, and reddi whip and I'm good to go.  Addiction/money wasting done for!!"
"I ordered pack of 4. I've been expected good coffee, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />One of 4 cut its packing, and just messed coffee up in the box.<br /><br />I had to throw away one. Now, honestly, I don't want to try it."
"Although I am a fan of Lavazza espresso, I found this blend extremely harsh with very high acidity which wreaked havoc with my stomach.  I am stuck with 9 bricks now (bought a case) and will have to find someone who really likes this blend."
"I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.coffee.I've.had. I decided to write a review because last weekend my husband made me a latte, and it was yummy. I asked for a second one, and what he gave me was not what I had the first time. I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what ""full bodied"" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD! It's so worth even $18 for 4 bricks!"
"I discovered this coffee while I was in Munich, Germany.  It is the smoothest, non-bitter coffee I had ever had.  I was able to get a few bricks back to the US but needed to find a way to get more.  Then I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Most people on here use it for their espresso machines, but I just use my ""Black-n-Decker"" coffee maker.  My guests always ask where they can get their hands on it.  A few friends and family have transitioned from their Maxwell House to Lavazza!"
"The worst thing is that they do not list the fact this is a 70% Robusto / 30% Arabica blend.<br />I do not like Robusto coffee at all. It has the taste of smelly socks. This is personal preference.<br />Since this coffee did NOT list that it is a Robusto blend and had such great reviews from many people (who obviously like Robusto coffee) I purchased it. I am dissatisfied with it and the item is not what I expected.<br />Since I was not able to return it, I opened one package.<br />Just for people to be aware."
"The Lavazza coffee Crema e Gusto is good,but it expires this month.<br />I bought four not knowing this(you should post expiration dates on food!)Now I will have three blocks of expired coffee. Not great folks!!!"
"as early as i can remember when going to italy, everyone i would visit would be cooking on the stove a pot of Lavazza Creme e Gusto.<br /><br />I was tickled to see that i could start getting this through amazon's subscribe & save.  Best deal on the internet!<br /><br />knock on wood, i've been doing this for over a year and not 1 shipment has ever been messed up.  The only way i would recommend something different is if you have a pressure brewer.  Lavazza has a brew just for that.<br /><br />I know that the Lavazza Qualita Rossa is their higher ""quality"" roast but i just can't taste it.  I dont think its bad but not better than Creme & Creme is cheaper.<br /><br />I keep the open pack in the fridge & the sealed packs in the freezer.  No arguments from my local spanish family or friends who makes a mean cup of espresso.  using ice cold spring water helps too ;)<br /><br />i use Bialetti Moka Express stove top & electric pots to brew my espresso"
"What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!"
"well after 2 months of trying new k-cup flavors, i got tired of the expense and waste. i bought a reusable k-cup from amazon (ecobrew) and am in the process of finding the perfect bean. THIS IS IT!!! i fill my cup halfway and brew it on the 8oz setting. not only is it a perfect cup of rich flavorful coffee, the bag has lasted soooo long! i bought when it was 12 bucks for 4 bags (subscribe and save) and i think this will last at least 2 months drinking 2-3 cups a day. absolutely no waste! i love my keurig and lavazza!!!<br /><br />i also have a wonderful espresso machine that i use this in, however the keurig is my new coffee toy to play with. either way the lavazza tastes great.<br /><br />note: it brews a lot slower due to the fine ground BUT this is the way to extract all the flavor. it is brews way too slow use less in the k-cup filter."
I tried this coffee as a drip and in the espresso maker.  I love good strong coffee.  This was much to weak and had a slight burnt taste.  Others seem to like it.  Perhaps it is just me.  I expected more.
"As my wife and I found we had become ""those people"" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter. And the crema produced is a dream - though the fancy, much older, espresso machine at work can't hope to achieve this with me driving it --- the DeLonghi is just newbie-proof and brews this blend really really nicely.<br /><br />Though she was initially disappointed I didn't splurge on the illy to christen the new machine, she likes the lattes we're making at home more than her $3 coffee shop favorite. This blend is fine for my mocha, too, though if she didn't LOVE this coffee I'd give the Rossa a whirl looking for just a little stronger flavor to stand up with the cocca powder. Frankly - this is making as good a mocha as what I buy at any of my 3 shops, so I'm happy too!<br /><br />Glad I trusted the reviews. I just signed up for a ""subscription"" - can't beat the price!"
"I decided to try the Lavazza blue pack (Crema e Gusto) instead of the one that I had found to be perfect in Europe, the Red pack or Lavazza Rossa. I like it but not as much as the Rossa. For my taste it is a little too mocha flavored and I prefer the more robust cafe espresso flavor of the red pack. The price for either coffee is very competetive, particularly if you take advantage of the subscription ordering option. I will be switching back to the Lavazza Rossa."
"This is my favorite one. I'm Italian and I used to drink this coffee also in Italy. It's the one that I prefer for my morning, after lunch and after dinner coffee, and I make it with the typical Italian coffee machine called Moka by Bialetti. Try it to believe me!"
"This is a great espresso, and amazon has the BEST price out there!  I can't drink hot coffee in the summer, so I have started brewing this the night before.  I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.  I have tried other brands, Illy, Fresh and Easy, but this is my favorite and the price is right."
"I am Italian and have grown up in Italy always drinking espresso from Moka machines. In our house we traditionally drank Lavazza, either Crema e Gusto or Oro ! I find crema e gusto less acid and a better value. I also loe pro but buy it only if on sale...not worth the difference. Ciao e buon caffe' !"
"great coffee. having lived in italy for a year, and coming back to new york always buying coffee from eataly is taking a toll on my wallet. the fact that this is so cheap and it's lavazza in the u.s., i love it. even though in italy, they sell a lavazza coffee brick like this in the supermarket for 90cent euro, i'm willing to settle for this as well.<br />only thing is, one of my coffee came in broken :/ but i think it's just by accident that the operations worker slashed it by accident when they are packaging it.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />update. everything came in perfect condition. was great coffee. i recommend everyone to keep this coffee in a jar, and put it in the fridge! i know it sounds a bit weird, but i swear the coffee will smell so fresh EVERYTIME you open that jar!"
"Lavazza  is best coffee for espresso. Although this blend is good, the Rossa version is better coffee.  The cost is a bit higher, but since you are saving money making your own espresso, spend the extra pennies."
"First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like. It is bold and strong, but no bitterness whatsoever. I recently bought a Curtis commercial coffee maker and was hoping for the same experience from my office and home. After a few different coffees (mostly local whole bean), I was disappointed that my coffee wasn't turning out as good as the cafe I went to. To my surprise, the next time I visited the local grocery store, I saw this Lavazza brand in the Italian isle. I immediately bought it and brewed it that night. After the first sip, I knew I had hit the jackpot. This is what I have been waiting for. All along it had been the coffee making the difference. The Curtis helps significantly with ensuring the proper temperature of the brew, but it is really the coffee that makes all the difference. I am impressed in the packaging and was surprised how packed they are able to get the ground coffee.<br /><br />BTW - I have only used this for my drip coffee maker - have not used it for espresso yet. For my taste, one coffee scoop (1/8 cup / or 2 tablespoons) for every 16 oz of water.<br /><br />As long as Amazon or my local grocer carries this coffee, I will be buying it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. ."
"I love this coffee! I drink about 2-4 cups a day. I used to be a Starbucks Dark Roast fan but Lavazza's won me over! I'm not a connoisseur, but I use a drip coffee maker and it tastes great."
"I started drinking coffee only about a month or so ago, but I was interested in trying some finer coffees.  This blend was very nice, with a nice rich coffee flavor without all the bitterness you would find with cheaper coffee.  I have not tried this with espresso, as I do not own an espresso machine.  With a drip machine, you will still experience the wonderfully bold flavor of this coffee.  I have had a few of my friends that love coffee try this blend and they were just as impressed as I was.  This is a must have in my house!"
"I recently purchased a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker, and read that Lavazza was a well-suited brand for use in this maker. After a few trials in getting the right coffee:water ratio, I can say that this blend of coffee is smooth, aromatic, and definitely delicious. I am a strong coffee drinker, and this dark roast coffee is a blend of Robutso and Arabica beans which makes the flavor much stronger and rich. It's definitely a full-bodied roast with great chocolate notes. Buy this coffee, and you will truly enjoy it, use it with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK"">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and you will not be disappointed!"
"I use this espresso for my electric espresso maker to make hot and iced lattes. It's bold.<br /><br />I usually buy this coffee - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5ERI"">Lavazza Caffe Espresso Ground Coffee, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a> - but wanted to try something that had a little more punch. This coffee is smooth (i.e. not acidic) but it packs a big flavor. If you're looking for a coffee that packs a good punch, this is the one. If you want more subtlety, I would go for the for the Lavassa Caffe Espresso."
always liked lavazza.  there is no bitter aftertaste and find it both good for esspresso maker and regular drip depending on the strength that you like.  it was a great deal from amazon.
"This is an amazing coffee.  Intense flavor, but not bitter.<br /><br />I use it in my Bialetti Moka espresso maker and the results are no less than phenomenal.  I prefer it served in shot form, as is.  But I've also tried it with a little sugar in the shot (very tasty), with a little frothed almond milk to create a cappuccino (good), and my husband has had it with frothed milk, and a little sugar to create a latte (he enjoys it immensely).<br /><br />I have always had an affinity for strong coffee, so this works out wonderfully for me.  Rich, intense flavor without the associated bitterness most coffee's have.<br /><br />I recommend you try it!"
"It's beyond me why this stuff has such great reviews. If you like the taste of burnt popcorn, then this coffee is for you! If you're like most people, however, and you're looking for a rich coffee taste DO NOT buy Lavazza... Yuck. Now I have to figure out how to get rid of the other 3 bags, don't think I can bring myself to use them."
"I bought this coffee after reading all the reviews. My initial impression was that this coffee was good (not excellent). Quickly, however, I realized that this coffee does not make me jittery (I'm very sensitive to caffeine). Also, this coffee does not have the bitter after taste. I think I'll definitely purchase this coffee again!"
"First of, there is nothing better than a cup of coffee made with fresh beans, being ground right before making the cup of coffee.  That being said, the Lavazza Crema e Gusto coffee is actually kind of great.  I bought it based on the number of great reviews on Amazon.  Opening the package I immediately noticed the back of the bag of coffee - it says 70% robusta beans and 30% arabica beans.  I was immediately nervous that this coffee would be horribly bitter, but after making a double ""shot"" Americano from my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK"">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> my fears disappeared. It is a very smooth, almost chocolatey coffee.  This coffee will be perfect to keep at my office where it's near impossible to get a good cup of coffee."
"I use this product with my french press and moka expresso maker. Both taste amazing. The coffee is smooth with rich flavor, and there is no bitterness at all! I think with good preservation, it can continue to be so. Very nice product."
"We use this coffee at home with our espresso machine and at work using our regular coffee maker. The taste is EXCELLENT! This product truly deserves all the stars it has. VERY rich, but smooooth taste at the same time. It beats starbucks & dunkin coffee.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Fair price ($20) and excellent product!"
"This is nice, full-bodied espresso, which I brew in my moka pot.  It doesn't do much to get crema in a moka pot, but then not much will with this method... but with the Robusta in this blend, you should experience crema a bit more easily in a machine. With my stove-top milk frother, a little steamed milk brings out the chocolaty notes described by Lavazza, and it's a nice morning treat.<br /><br />This amount (4 bricks, 8.8oz each) has lasted me a good 3 months of summertime use in a 6c moka pot.  I'll probably go to every 2 months on my subscription for autumn through spring."
"I purchased this brand of coffee when I purchased Bialetti Moka Express L'Original 12 Cup Espresso Maker. Up until now, I've had no experience with either. Normally, I'm the type of person to find one brand of coffee and stick with it. When the price of my current brand of coffee shot up, I started looking around for something else.<br /><br />What caught my eye was the Arabica/Indian/Robusta blend. It sounded so exotic. Plus, the chocolaty flavor in the description. I've never been one for dark coffee, but if it had a chocolaty undertone, I was in. Besides, the onetime cost of $20.13 for a pack of four (as of 07/23/2011) was reasonable.<br /><br />My cup of coffee is mixed with equal parts of cream, but my husband only uses a little. Both of us agree this is a smooth cup of coffee with no bitter taste. We love it so much that I've signed up for the subscribe and save plan. Now it's only $17.11 for a pack of four. Again, this is as of 07/23/2011."
"I first tasted and loved Lavazza espresso during time in Italy, where it's popularly consumed. The rich aroma and full flavor are a delight, and I don't find it overly acidic (it's certainly MUCH easier on my stomach than American-style drip coffee, and this from someone with strong stomach and a love of all kinds of drip coffees). I haven't tasted the various Lavazza roasts extensively, but I typically buy and adore Crema e Gusto--in fact, I brew it *every* single morning I'm at home and drink it latte-style, at about a 2:1 warmed-milk to hot-espresso ratio.<br /><br />I heartily recommend buying an authentic Italian stovetop coffeemaker to brew this espresso. I have and love the Bialetti six-cup caffettiere (Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker, found here on Amazon). It's what the typical Italian family uses every morning and throughout the day.<br /><br />The Lavazza vacuum packs are sturdy and small little bricks that store easily, and every time I snip open a new container the distinctive, warm aroma rush fills my kitchen. Mmmm, Lavazza."
"I was buying Lavazza Caffe Espresso at local vons for 5.99. Now it's 7.99 so I checked amazon. still more than 5.99 so I bought this, cheapest Lavazza for 18.98 with subscription.<br /><br />according to their website, Caffe Espresso is medium, this is dark roast and this has some sweetness.<br /><br />when i opened the package, soon i noticed this has a stronger aroma, a bitter kind. unlike starbucks italian dark roast, it's still brown.<br /><br />i used bialetti moka machine. usually make it latte. i think this is bitterer than Caffe Espresso and I feel some bitterness remains on my tongue. maybe this is more like natural Espresso taste but I prefer Caffe Espresso. and i have one opened pack and three unopened packs left..."
"Have traveled a great deal in Italy and love the coffee there, but often miss an American cup of coffee. Their espresso is what this is made for and it's awesome. It was simply too fine for good drip coffee."
"Although I have always used Kimbo Neapolitan roast for my morning stove-top espresso(or cappuccino)I found the Lavazza Crema e Gusto ground coffee bricks to be a more than acceptable substitute...especially considering the price!I purchased two 4 packs and qualified for free shipping, too. I am an Italian-American who lived in Naples, Italy for 4 years so I know my espresso and cappuccino. This is good."
"I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!"
Yes i did say drip. I have now tried 2 different lavazza brands. This is the better of the two but do not discount the other as i love it equally. I will continue to buy both as i love the occasional change up. If you use this in a drip coffee pot i would suggest staring out with using just over half of the normal amount you usually use then move on from there. With other brands including starbucks i would use 1 - 1.5 scoops per cup. So in my 5 cup maker depending on what taste i was going after i would use up to 8 scoops. With both lavazza coffees i have found 3-3.5 scoops is ideal in my 5 cup maker. It takes a few times to get it in your head that so much less coffee works but it does.
"Good tasting, produces good crema. This is a fine grind, which is perfect for La Pavoni handle pull machines. Pack the basket tight and you'll get a gorgeous, rich shot. I also like the relatively smalll amount of waste the foil pack generates relative to products packed in cans."
"Love the Lavazza crema E Gusto. It is very finely ground and produces a rich crema on my coffee, which i can not get with my own grinder if i buy beans. Excellent taste and medium strong."
"I know this coffee from Europe and for me it is the best espresso: Strong, but a creamy mild taste. From guests I get regulary complements on my coffee."
I don't drink coffee but my husband does and he is addicted. He's not fit to live with when he runs out of coffee and this is his favorite kind. The Amazon price is the best deal I've found. It keeps peace in our home and it smells terrific!
"After many years of searching for good italian coffee without that bitter after taste, here comes lavazza. Italy's no.1 coffee and an exceptional coffee worldwide. I use it in my drip coffee machine as well as my Italian espresso.<br />Love it!<br />Very happy that Amazon have it at a great price, thanks Amazon!"
gave this a try based on the reviews.<br /><br />big disappointment.<br /><br />Coffee is stale and lacking in flavor. I'm sticking with Tully's.
I bought this after reading all the great reviews. It's a bit better than Folgers in my taste. Something bitter in the flavor. Kind of disappointed really.
"Ma se non conoscete Crema e Gusto siete proprio un branco di froci scatenati e succhiacazzi a volont&agrave;. Il Crema e Gusto &egrave; Crema e gusto, e cazzo se ogni momento &egrave; quello giusto!"
I used it with dual boiler Bezzera and also with Moka pot. Neither taste nor crema was good. This is like paying BMW money and getting most basic VW.
"I read the reviews and went for it.  Having little experience with the brand, I was nervous about trying it. But, I really wanted a better espresso that my husband and I had available.  Starbucks was acceptable, but not great and grocery store brands were laughable.<br /><br />I am so glad I trusted the reviews!! Six months later, we don't drink anything else now and have no desire to pay someone else to make a sub-par cup o' joe. The flavor of Lavazza is strong, full, and without bitterness.<br /><br />If you're on the fence - go for it.  It was totally worth the chance we took."
"I bought it after the great reviews. Instead of buying the bialetti for the stovetop, I used my bodum french press despite of it being too fine ground. 2 Cups of hot microwaved water (getto style haha) with 1.5 scoop of coffee is perfect for me. Despite of it being very bold with the crema on top, I'm surprised that it doesn't taste bitter and sour at all! I added a bit of french vanilla, VERY TASTY! Get the individual brick if you're still not sure (sold by LaPrima Shops for $7.49)<br /><br />Try it, you'll love it!"
"I'm no coffee aficionado but I know what doesn't suck, and this coffee doesn't. It works well in my stovetop espresso maker as well as in the ol' Bunn. When I use it in my French press it's pretty dreggy but I like it like that. Alls I can say is this coffee is bold and flavorful and has pretty much become my everday coffee."
"I am from Italy and I came to the US a couple of weeks ago (I will stay here for  a year). I am really sorry but I have to say that for my taste american coffee is a kind of ""watered down"" soft drink. Thus, I brought my espresso machine with me and I am so happy that Amazon is selling this italian coffee. I really love it and I will definitely order this product again: it is italian coffee, good price and extremely fast shipping. What more could you ask for?"
"For the longest time I've been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I've been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price?"
Looks like I finally found my favorite. I have tried new coffee for last few years looking for something I really liked. This one blows others out of the water. Try it and you will not regret it.
"I received my order of four (4) packs of this coffee yesterday and today, upon opening the bricks that were shrink-wrapped together, I noticed that one of the individual packages was clearly not vacuum sealed.  Sure enough, at the bottom of the package, I could see a slice from what was most likely a straight razor used to open a box.  Hmm...out with that package.  (I should add that the shipping box was was in perfect condition.)<br /><br />Understandably, this type of thing can happen with packaging / stocking.  Still, I'm a little disappointed that on my first order, only 3 out of 4 packages are any good."
"I've tried a few options with my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG"">DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker</a> and always end up coming back to this Lavazza. My kids think I'm strange that I get so excited every time an Amazon box shows up with more coffee in it. Amazon's subscription service is awesome. The coffee just keeps showing up to my door for less than it would cost to buy inferior coffee at my grocery store.<br /><br />I love this coffee! (Of course, that might just be the six shots of espresso talking)"
"Not only is this some very tasty coffee, Amazon offers it at a very good price.  I'm quite pleased with this purchase and can recommend it to others with no reservation."
This is the espresso that I like best.  Works great with my Brika and gives a lot of crema.  I buy the bulk packaging and the quality has been very consistent.
Great coffee. The cream that comes out with the espresso machine is always perfect!<br />If you like a strong bold aroma this is the coffee for you.
"I tried to learn to like the taste, but it did not happen, no matter how hard I tried.  The coffee has a strange aroma and after taste (like some sort of a strong chemical), and I have been drinking Italian espressos all my life.  After I ran out of the 4 bricks, I also stopped getting the runs and stomach pains every morning.  No more rushing to the toilet after breakfast!  I initially believed I was beginning to have unknown health problems, but after quitting this coffee, I realized that my health was fine.  For some reason it worked out terribly for me.  Espresso drinking has always been a ritual of delight for me.  Aroma, color, taste, and the feel-good-effect after drinking the coffee should all combine to bring forth a unique moment of goodness."
"Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.<br /><br />With a drip coffee maker, a permanent gold filter has no chance, as the fine grind blocks the filter and quickly causes the coffee maker to overflow. Paper filters are even worse, clogging up almost instantly.<br /><br />I'll end up giving it away since I can't actually make a good batch without excessive messes."
"I didn't care for this particular Lavazza coffee at all.<br />It's very one-dimensional and has no aroma whatsoever.<br />Even though it's a darker roast, and I prefer a darker flavor,<br />this one just tastes acidic and ""muddy"" to me.<br />I like Lavazza Oro better. Oro is definitely much lighter, but at least it<br />has aroma and depth."
"I have only made this coffee in my drip maker, which does not produce a brew as tasty my french press or stove top burner. It produces a decent cup that is good and not bitter, but also does not have an abundance of character."
"This coffee is the best tasting and highest-quality you can get for the price.  It's difficult to find in my area's stores and when I can find it, it's very over-priced.  I can't go a morning without my LavAzza!"
"Once I started using this coffee I realized that the coffee maker is not what makes good coffee, it is the quality and flavor of the coffee you are using.  I tried many different types of coffee and this is one of my favorites for espresso and cappuccinos.  Highly recommend this.  I have a 12 year old Krups cappuccino maker that makes the perfect cappuccino in the morning with this coffee.  Most other coffee grounds fell short."
"After returning from Italy a few years ago, where my husband and I fell in love with the Lavazza espresso served in the cafes, we Googled ""Lavazza Crema e Gusto"" and found it on Amazon.  We have been ordering it ever since.  Bold, smooth, rich, abundant crema.....pure Italy!!"
"I don't regularly drink coffee but my wife does.  After a visit to Italy a few years ago my wife became hooked on great coffee, and Lavazza is just that.  She uses a moka pot, and Italian coffee pot/stove top espresso maker.  The Amazon scheduled delivery is also great."
I have a soy latte every morning -- using this in my stovetop expresso maker.  No other coffee even comes close to the thick creamy coffee that this brane makee.  I use 1 cup low fat Silk chocolate soy milk (heated in the microwave) to three expresso cups of coffee.  Delicious!
"I use this coffee in my Bialetti Brikka and thoroughly enjoy a quick espresso several times a week.  Great flavor - strong but not bitter, smooth and delicious every time.  Thanks Amazon!"
"I love this stuff. I've tried the other Lavazza blends and they're all good, but this one is my favorite so far. Very bold flavor. Bitter, but not nasty bitter. It brews dark and foamy. It's smells good. The price is really good too, definitely cheaper here than in the stores."
"I bought this based on my experience in europe. I figured it was Italian and would taste as much of the coffees did when last I visited Europe, Bold and stout. Also, I was drawn in by the words ""La Crema""...meant strong and with much head like a beer I thought.Unfortunately, the coffee was much like a regular, everyday folgers blend, kinda bland and fairly regular. Buy it if you like regular coffee but pass otherwise."
"Very nice and strong Coffee, works very well in Mocha machine. I couldn't make that coffee very creamy in my hand though."
I am a new espresso machine owner and am experimenting to find the best (least bitter) yet strong espresso.. I tried Cafe Bustelo which is decent and an Italian brand from grocery store. This brand is so far the smoothest yet still strong which is important to me. I also use in French Press when I am in the mood for good ole regular coffee.
"I had been using Illy's Dark Roast for my daily latte, but I was getting sick of the incredibly high price for one 8.8 ounce can. This Lavazza has the same strength, but with a hint of chocolate (best way to describe it, honestly) and I find it has a much smoother feel to it. Plus, I can get four 8.8 ounce bricks for the price of 2 Illy 8.8 ounce cans... Glad I switched!"
"I've been using this in my moka pot for several months. I also make an occasional pour-over with this coffee. Both methods have had excellent dark and rich results. Every time a open a new bag, the smell is outstanding."
"We use this in our espresso maker and it makes a good latte, but I thought I'd be blown away by the ""crema"" part of the taste. Just tastes like a normal homemade espresso - nothing different than when we make it with Starbucks or whatnot. That said, great price if you do the Subscribe and Save...."
From the other reviews I thought this would be at least as full flavored as Cafe Bustelo but it's not. It's more mild and I prefer a deeper stronger coffee flavor. I do like the creamy texture of this coffee but not enough to switch to it. I may try other varieties by Lavazza since it gets such good reviews all the time.
"I make espresso on a Krups machine with Cafe Lavazza. In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.<br /><br />However, if I compare Lavazza to the beans that I bought at Four Barrel in San Francisco last week, Lavazza's flavor seems pretty boring. I give it 4 stars because it is a great deal for the price and has good flavor."
"I was expecting something with much more flavor given the product description and the many stellar reviews, but this is the worst coffee I've tried since I signed up for the Gevalia club.  Even at Amazon's current significantly reduced price, this simply isn't worth it."
"i drink tea on a daily basis and my boyfriend had some of this tea in loose leaf form. I decided that messing around with tea leaves was too much work and I happened upon the same tea in a teabag form. I was so excited that my favorite tea would be user friendly. This tea is amazing! The flavor is tantalizing, fresh, and relaxing. I have 1-2 cups a day. And believe it or not, you can actually get two cups of tea out of one teabag! A delectable treat from the middle east!"
"Sadaf Special Blend is my 'special occasion' tea, the one I break out for company or really bad days when I need something yummy and comforting.  I took one box to Haiti and made it last for three years, doling it out to myself and the odd visitor like it was gold.  So imagine my joy to return at last to the US and find this 4-pack on Amazon, deliverable straight to my door!  I already gave one box as a gift for a friend who shares my tea obsession, but I am happily enjoying a regular mug of Sadaf Special Blend.  Will definitely stock up before my next overseas move, as should all tea lovers.  It is the perfect combination of cardamom and other spices -- mixed with milk and occasionally honey, there's no beating it."
"I'm drinking this tea for the last 12 years. And let me tell you compare to Tedley and other like it, This by far has the best taste of all. The taste is very smooth and is not overwhelming. I drink 5-6 of these tea bag a day. Occasionally i purchase other brands(to try new ones) but i end up coming back to Sadaf. If you read the description on other brand like Tedley, you'll find that they actually use chemicals to alter the taste so it can taste more like cardamom. We already have too many food in our life that contains chemical and i dont want my tea be one of them."
"My cats go crazy over this food!  I was worried they would not like it, because it is shredded, but it did not bother them one bit.  The ingredient list is great, as well.  Also, it is one of the few canned cat foods that does not contain carrageenan, which I recently found out causes GI problems in cats (and possibly cancer)."
"My cat has a sensitive tummy and he does really well on the most natural foods. And of the foods that proclaim to be ""all natural"", only Tiki Cat seems to deliver results. His favorite is this chicken. And what's in it? CHICKEN. And chicken broth. Nothing else. You open the can and see shreds of chicken that look like you're getting ready to make chicken salad. It's very wet, so the cat will be less thirsty, I've noticed that. He loves this chicken and his stomach is so much better."
"Flavor tastes kind of like cherry I guess if you have a good imagination.  Not like real, fresh cherries but more like maraschino."
"This product does the trick for me- provides a reasonable cherry flavor for beverages (soda in my case). On the single bottle (rather than 3-pack) variant of this product some reviewers say the flavor is not very strong. Others say it taste more like maraschino cherry. I think the issue with that is that this flavor is, in fact, extremely potent. Anything but 1-2 drops in a standard size beverage will be too much (think cough syrup). I had to buy some pipettes to control the dose.<br /><br />On the plus side, figuring ~20 drops per ml that's about 300 drinks per one-ounce bottle which is a good deal.<br /><br />I think the flavor is fine in the proper dose but be prepared to use an eye dropper or pipette."
"I sent this assortment of cheeses to my parents (who love french cheeses) and hoped for the best. Here was there response in an email: ""Thank you so much for the wonderful gift...we enjoyed all the cheeses and goodies that went with the cheeses...the package was very elegant too."" Because they live so far away. we didn't get to try the cheeses, but they said that they were all excellent and of the highest quality. I will definitely order from this company again."
"The Abbey de Belloc was heavenly! I'd want this for my last meal! It was THAT good! I'm not a Camembert fan, but I did enjoy that too. The goat cheese was nothing I couldn't buy in the supermarket, so I was a little disappointed in the chevre. Personally, I wish they'd have kept the little knife and the petits toasts and added a little more cheese. The only gripe I have is that the pouch that's supposed to keep things cold leaked and ruined my tabletop!! So throw that out as soon as you get it!"
"I bought this for my dad's birthday, he loved each of the cheeses and he also told me he was impressed with the whole package. This is definitely a great gift for all cheese lovers :)"
"The cheese is great - the packaging is out of date.  The problem is the cheese ships in styrofoam, which is a petroleum based product that cannot be recycled and is a major source of ocean debris.  Thus, this product, although delicious, is non-sustainable because of its packaging.  For those who care about the environment, look to other sources for cheese.  I will."
This is awesome!! I got this for my mother for Easter so she could have the candy that she got when she was a child...unfortunately shipping was terrible.
I bought this to take on a trip with friends who had grown up in 3 different decades. The box was nice enough to present as a gift. The candy was a huge hit. Everyone was so excited to search for their favorite candy. We  were ordered to dig to the bottom for more candy cigs & atomic fireballs. It brought up lots of childhood stories and wonderful memories. These would be great hostess gifts or great gifts for a family member who grew up in a different generation.
I've been an avid green tea drinker for many years and Dragon Well is my favorite variety. I started looking for an organic tea and was pleased to find this available on Amazon for a reasonable price. This is a mellow tea - a bit more mild than what I was used to - but good tasting. I would have rated it a 4 but there have been some quality control problems in the packaging. I've  opened a few envelopes to find either no tea bag at all or a torn bag with loose tea spilled into the envelope.
"I just love chick peas. Add some brown rice and decent spices, and I'm a happy camper. I'm just not so sure that this product is something I can eat regularly owing to the salt content. Per can: calories 385, fat 3.5g, trans fat 0, sodium 805mg (35% RDA), total carbs 77g, fiber 10.5g, protein 14g, (sugar &lt;1g per serving with 3.5 servings per can). It's just a regular size can, so I don't understand 3.5 servings per can."
This product falls a little flat. I have been trying out alot of the flavors from this product line and so far this one is my least favorite. Who knew that something filled with curry power and cumin could taste so blah!
"All of the EDEN ethnic rice and bean combos are great! I always add something fresh to them to make a one-bowl meal. The Moroccan rice and beans has a hint of cinnamon, so I like to cook it with apple chunks or slices."
"the casing around the seed left in the filling mix, feels like eating pieces of plastic its not very appetising"
I thought that this was a nice change from the standard twiz. I left a package in each of my teacher's classrooms to help prepare them for the new year.  I enjoyed the product and would purchase again.  Product was soft and not waxy as described by others.
"I love licorice - usually.  The cherry flavor has very little, if any cherry flavor.  They taste like sticks of wax.  I don't think I'll be able to even give this nasty stuff away.  I'm really kind of angry that I paid this much for what I thought would be regular, delicious licorice.  It's not hard or stale, just has a horrible waxy type feel and flavor.  Maybe I can save it by melting it all together, adding a wick, and making candles out of it?  At least the color is pretty."
It was such good product. Came in two different boxes as it is described and covered with plastic wrap together.
We have been eating this rice for past 8 years and the rice has absolute consistent quality and texure every time we make it. We have been buying this from an ethnic store but now Amazon has the rice at even a better price. Would recommend soaking the rice for 30 min or so for best results.<br /><br />This rice is grown in the foothills of Himalayas and is enriched with minerals and natural Aroma. We have cooked many dishes including some Tea Rice and they are to die for. We would highly recommend this brand of Rice for your entire family.
"We've been buying Arya Basmati rice for years and prefer it over any of the other varieties we have tried. We are thrilled for it to be available on Amazon and even more to find out that it is the best selling rice on Amazon. It is perfectly aged, quite fragrant, not sticky and lends itself to countless recipes and culinary applications. This is one of those rice that one can eat plain, without any seasoning or additional flavorings.<br /><br />We do not agree with the previous reviewer about the bag and packaging. All major Basmati brands come in this kind of packaging to avoid infestation by providing oxygen, cost of material, ease of storage and of course recycling of the bags to save natural resources. Plastic containers on the other hand pollute our system and add price without adding any value to the rice. The true Basmati rice is aged for a min 1 year to give a full flavor of aroma when cooked and they are stored in such bags, only in large quantities.<br /><br />Basmati can be cooked in many different ways with many many different dishes. One of our favorite and quick recipe for Basmati rice is below.<br /><br />Recipe for Peas Pulao:<br />Ingredients<br />2 cups water<br />2 tablespoon oil<br />1 cup Basmati rice<br />1/4 cup frozen green peas<br />1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />Directions<br />Saut&eacute; cumin seeds in oil using a saucepan, until light brown.<br />Add rice, peas, water to the saucepan and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 12 minutes.<br />When rice is cooked, stir gently to fluff it up.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes."
"We have tried several Basmati Rice over the years and finally settled on this brand. It really has full length grain and gives the aroma of a true basmati as it should. Most of the other brands we have tried are either blended rice or not real Basmati at all and were still called Basmati. It is on our regular buy cycle from Amazon. We highly recommend everyone to try it.<br /><br />The basmati rice should only be judged after it is cooked and tasted. We love the fact that this rice is packed in a jute bag which is bio-degradable and not packaged in some fancy plastic box or other material with is not good for our environment. The rice should be washed before it is cooked and soaked for 20-30 minutes for the best results after cooking. Amazon also sells a 2 lb version of this same rice but we like the 10 lb version as it is better price per oz and we consume a whole lot of rice.<br /><br />Update: August 14, 2010<br /><br />Still the same wonderful product and the same aromatic flavor of this perfect rice."
You'll love this best tasting rice on the market.  Don't forget to wash the rice before you put it in your rice cooker or if you prefer to boil and strain it. It makes a difference.  We also soak the rice for minimum 30 mins before cooking and be sure to add a tablespoon ofolive oil (Veg oil also ok) . The rice comes out outstanding and a real treat to eat. Buy this or the 2lb package they have to try it. Must try it to see the real difference.
"The rice is good.  We've been eating Basmati rice for a long time, and before finding this on Amazon we've purchased all our rice at the local grocery store in those small single meal packages.<br /><br />I read the reviews on here, so was aware of the packaging problem when I received my first order.  Just as everyone had written, packaging was very poor.  Due to the packaging issues, I decided to transfer the rice into a sealed container.  I recommend doing this for any bulk product, since you'll want to seal anything you'll be storing for more than a week.  However, even though I was aware of the packaging issues, I still accomplished to spill a couple ounces of rice all over the kitchen counter and floor.  That's how poor the packaging is!  It's almost as if someone was playing some trick on me, because I poored almost all the rice into the container and thought it went quite well.  No real problems, so I figure these other people probably just happened to get a bad bag.  So when I got down to the last couple ounces, I thought it would be easier to pull the plastic bag out (which is inside the mesh sack) and pour the remainder into the container.  Guess what?  A hole at the very BOTTOM of the plastic bag.  Believe me when I say, a couple ounces of rice is a lot of work to clean up.<br /><br />I must say, though, that after transferring the rice to the container, I smelled this wonderful aroma.  I've never actually smelled the scent of rice before, and this was pleasant.  The rice cooked just as well as any other rice we've prepared, and it had the same hint of taste as the aroma.  Very good rice for our common Indian curriies and Thai stir fry dishes.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the packaging."
"The rice has the taste of the burlap bag that it is packaged in.  Even after cooking, it smelled like the bag<br />I would not recommend it.  Thanks"
"This rice is a Himalaya Mt. range crop. It arrived in a hemp bag. It has nutrition information on a tag stringed to it. However, there is no instructions for preparation. It is wonderfully aromatic. It has taken some experimentation to cook it. At first I measured probably too much water and seemed flaky. However, by decreasing the measure of water to rice, I have found it best, because it tastes firm and somewhat chewy. Bon Appetite."
"I should have listened to the negative reviews, but I thought they had experienced a fluke... perhaps the bags ruptured during transport and caused the problems they reported? Surely the positive reviews outweighed the negative. Well, my bag arrived intact and undamaged but the inner bag was, as stated by others, unsealed and exposed to the air. This might have been good rice when it originally shipped from the vendor, but by time it left the distribution center and arrived at my door the rice was stale, tainted by the odor of the bag, and inedible by my standards. I eat rice every day, but I will not be eating this rice."
"Ok quality, stadard basmati rice - But packaging is a problem. Comes in a hessian bag which is totally unnecessary - The plastic bag within the hessian (which holds the rice) was mostly open when the rice arrived (meaning that the rice was open to the air). The rice had taken on a smell from the hessian (which changed the taste even once it was cooked). The hessian smell was stronger than the usual (lovely) distinct basmati smell. After 2-3 weeks of storage the rice started to go stale and developed yellow/brownish patches on some grains."
"I've never ordered a food item from Amazon before.  I ordered this because I could no longer find the brand in our local stores.  Truth is, this is so much easier and less expensive.  I set it up on a regular refill schedule so I got a discount.  It comes to the door and I don't have to think about it.  I can cancel the refill schedule anytime I want.  Very cool.  Now I'm checking out the prices of some of the other foods Amazon offers.<br /><br />As far as rice goes, Arya is the best basmati rice I've ever had.  I look for this brand."
"I've never had Basmati rice before. So I really have nothing to compare to. But, I do love rice. I've always enjoyed jasmine. This was even better. I enjoyed this rice immensely. Some have mentioned flavor from the bag. I did not have this issue. Since 10 lbs is a lot of rice I did immediately put into glass covered jars. When I need to replenish I will not hesitate to purchase this rice again."
"I think this rice is fantastic.  I have not had any of the packaging problems some other people have mentioned (and I would not be happy if I did - I do hope that issue is resolved).  Mine arrived fully intact and the rice itself is of the highest quality I have ever seen.  This is a product from Pakistan as that is clearly marked on the bag I purchased.  I use a little less water than is recommended by my rice cooker and it has always come out absolutely perfectly.  Each rice kernal is separated and fluffy and perfect.  Flavorful and aromatic.  I just love it.  I also highly recommend the Aroma ARC-856 rice cooker that is sold by Amazon.<br /><br />Here is how I cook this rice.  Using the measuring cup from my rice cooker - 2 cups of rice, 2 and 1/3rd cups of water, a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil (I use extra virgin olive oil if out), a taste of butter, sea salt, a dash of cinamon and a fair amount of fresh ground black pepper.  My mouth is watering just typing this :)<br /><br />I would love to read your favorite recipe in my comments section."
"First of all, the inner plastic lining of the bag was punctured and a lot of the rice spilled out into the outer burlap bag.  The rice smelled and tasted like diesel fuel or something toxic.  I could not eat it and had to throw it all out."
"I read some reviews of poor packaging on this item. I thought by now the problem would have been addressed and corrected. Um... WRONG! The rice is contained within an open plastic bag inside the potato sack. When I opened it, only a portion of the plastic bag was closed while half of the opening was left open exposing the rice to the odor of the potato sack. Are you guessing that when you order the rice that maybe the problem will be fixed???... you might be right... and you might be wrong. Do you feel lucky?"
I agree with the previous reviewer who complained about the packaging.  Mine too arrived with the inner plastic bag open.  The rice had taken on the smell of the outer bag and already contained some yellow grains.  They need to fix this packaging before I will buy again.
"Might not even be considered a sausage, whatever, don't care.  Best I've ever tasted, got it off of a deal site, ran low, looked around in stores for other dried sausages in a desperate attempt to find a replacement.  I tried about a dozen different brands from different parts of the country (I travel a lot), all of them tasted very greasy, just an oily, fat, near-seasonless mess.<br /><br />This company, and this dried sausage are de-friggin-licious.  It doesn't come off as ""greasy"" at all, and it has SO much flavor, and is so condensed it's hard to even compare it to anything else.  I've never had anything like it, and I eat less of it at a time because it's so flavorful.<br /><br />I will be buying more when I get low again, and I can't recommend it enough."
Product ordered and shipped very quickly but for the item itself was not aged at all!  Very soft and gooey. Can not recommend this product to anyone!
Absolutely wonderful product. Just like I was used from Italy and Germany. Will order again. It's a wonderful treat no matter how you 'slice' it...
"There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.<br /><br />While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the ""freshest and most mouth-watering desserts"" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this."
"The gift I received from Amazing Clubs was phenomenal. I got a shipment of dessert brownies and they were delicious. They were packed in a red tin and were kept incredibly fresh. I got two kinds, one seemed to be a coconut brownie and the other double chocolate. The coconut brownie was so fudgey and the coconut spread was prepared perfectly. It matched the fudgeyness of the brownie and had a great flavor. I thought that the double chocolate ones were going to be dry because I waited to eat them, but to my surprise they were just as good as the coconut ones. I received my shipment right on time and in perfect condition. I even called to inquire about when I would receive my gift, and customer service was able to track my order and give me a delivery date, not to mention they explained how my gift would be selected. I would highly recommend the brownies, they make a great gift and for someone looking for new gift ideas, Amazing Clubs is a great resource. Although most of these gifts I would probably take for myself before I could gift them. I cannot wait for my next shipment to see what I get next! Great gifts for a fair price."
"Received these as a gift from a friend and will now be sending it as gifts for others! So much better than the usual gifts, especially for those friends who live in another city! Every time I receive a shipment I happily think of my friend who sent them. The brownies were such a lovely surprise to come home to after a long day at work! They are delicious and huge!! Can't wait to see what they send next!"
"For Christmas, I was given the very generous gift of 6 months of Amazing Clubs ""Dessert of the Month.""  Overall, I was extremely disappointed in the professionalism of the company, particularly given how much my relative invested in what was truly a thoughtful and unique gift. The company does not provide either nutrition information or, perhaps more importantly, a list of ingredients, for most of their desserts. This can pose a serious risk to individuals with any food allergy.  Upon requesting such information,  I was simply told, and I quote: ""We choose not to disclose our vendor's information to keep our clubs exclusive and a continuous surprise for our members."" Of the six months of dessert we received, three desserts arrived with issues. We received a mango tart in dry ice that had clearly melted/evaporated. Since I didn't have the list of ingredients, nor any knowledge of how long it had been sitting ""unrefrigerated,"" I had to throw the entire tart out. We received a cheese cake in the same state.  Cookies were shipped, one month, and upon receipt they were dry, and every one was broken and crumbling. This is not to say that every dessert was bad. We got two months of brownies (which were superb) and one month of a coffee cake (which did come with nutrition info/ingredients).  Dessert products aside, the shipments were always on time. While the company offers a wide variety of other clubs to try, given my experience with the Dessert of the Month club, I would be very hesitant to try any of the other options."
"So I have a cousin who is a vegan and i had no idea what to get her for x-mas. I stumbled upon this gift basket, what a joke. The item description makes it sound good and worth $70.00. But it mainly consists of crackers and very small jars of peanut butter and jelly."
"I've used this brand for several years now and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting great tasting pepper. I've tried several other brands, but none can beat the great taste of Olde Thompson."
"This is, by far, the best tasting pepper I've ever had. This company also offered it at the best price I could find."
"I love fresh ground pepper! We bought an Olde Thompson Pepper Supreme Adjustable Grinder (4.8oz 136g) from somewhere. Getting Geezerish now, don't remember where. Maybe World Market? Anyway, it was good stuff. Whole peppercorns in the grinder. Black, green, white and pink. Great to add a healthy grind to any dish. We have three empty grinders that need filling, so I found this three pack of whole peppercorns (sans grinder), at an Excellent Price on Amazon. Should be the same mix of pepper. We shall see."
I purchased these cookies and must say that I absolutely love them. It's delicious and tastes just like the regular sandwich cookies. I highly recommend it.
This is a delightful cookie with a great taste and low saturated fat.  Anyone with a sugar-restricted diet would enjoy this and other Murray Sugar-Free cookies (especially the chocolate creme's).  These only have around 3 grams of carbohydrates a piece!!
"I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)"
"My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be ""sugar free"", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need ""special"" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for ""special"" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit."
"I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great."
"First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda.<br />I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.<br /><br />They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick."
These shortbread cookies are little drops of heaven.  Have you ever noticed that smaller food seems to taste better?  One pouch is one carb and very satisfying.  No meaasuring is always good too.
I purchased these for my husband as he was recently diagnosed as diabetic.  I eat them as much as he does!  There is no strange after-taste as with some sugar-substitute enhanced foods.  We highly recommend.
"I love these cookies, wish I could find them, I buy lots every time I find them.....but I do eat them. Help! I need more!"
"Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a ""sweet"" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!"
"When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option."
"My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are ""unhealthy"".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online."
The cookies have an excellent taste and texture. I took them to a friend's house and they had no idea the were sugar free until I told them. I snack on them at work and willl be trying other varieties by Murray.
"For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!"
"I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!"
"theses cookies are good , oatmeal seems to be my favorite and best of all you would never know they were sugar free if the label didnt say it. i will purchase this product again ,they're that good!"
"Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed. They are very good. Highly recommended."
"These oatmeal cookies have a great spice taste -- pronounced yet not at all harsh.  Light and crisp, and they also keep well."
"Good cookies. They're made with Splenda. I guess that makes them sugarfree. They certainly don't taste like they are. I despise the taste of fake sweetners, but the folks at this company did a great job. The cookies are very yummy! I only gave it four stars, because I prefer soft  and chewy oatmeal cookies."
"These cookies are not only good tasting but helps me stay on tract with my diet.  It is a little expensive but, I have lost 40lbs. I like the convenience.  You can get them at ""Wal-Mart"" sometimes."
"These are not soft shortbread cookies but Krunchy with a hint of butter. Great for t2 diabetics but, as you know, anything we eat moderation is key. Although pricey buying a case [12] is a lot cheaper than buying single packs retail at your local grocer."
These cookies are awesome.  Great for dieters and those cutting out sugar.  So good!  You won't miss your old Oreos at all.
"My wife is diabetic.  On a recent ospital stay, she was served these cookies on her tray.  She brought an extra two pack home and I enjoyed them.  We went online to Murray website and ordered a box.  We are very happy with the product.  One thing ... separation of the two cookies happens sometimes....doesn't get in the way of these tasty treats!"
"I ordered a case of 12 packages and only three cookies were broken. They taste delicious and eight cookies are only 130 calories. Plus, overall, it was less expensive than purchasing them in a store (and that's not even taking into account gas for your vehicle)."
"I LOVE these cookies!  As a Type 1 diabetic and a Weight Watcher I still have a strong craving for sweets and chocolate in particular!  This cookie packet solves it all for me!  They give me the great taste of sweet chocolate without the guilt of blowing my diabetic or my weight loss diets!  And I feel like I get so many of them since they're small!  I also love the fact that they're portioned out for me.<br />I can't say enough about these cookies and cannot wait until they're available on the shelves again!  Please hurry, Murray! :)"
"My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4"">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me ""You know I can't have sugar."" and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said ""It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present.""<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle."
Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores. She likes these and the shortbread cookies. They have a nice flavor for sugar-free and I recommend them to anyone on a low sugar diet.
"I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often."
My hubby loves these cookies.  He would eat the entire shipment in one week if I would let him.  :-)
"Hard to find a better crispy sugar-free cookie and, believe me, I've looked.  Good price, good storage."
"I can't have sugar, so was very pleased to find these great tasting cookies. Friends I have shared them with were surprised to learn they were sugar free. Being able to get them from Amazon is a plus, since distribution in my local stores is spotty."
These little chocolate bites give you the pleasing sensation of chocolate - without the guilt of the sugar calories!!  Great job Murray!!
Murray's Sugar Free Peanut Butter cookies are one of my favorites and<br />are as good as any peanut butter cookies that are not sugar free. I keep<br />a supply on hand and my some of my friends have started buying them even<br />though they don't need to have sugar free products.  All Murray cookies<br />that I have bought have been very good. I'm a many times repeat customer.
"I have tried several types of Murray sugar free cookies and can say that they have all been good and the ""Fudge Dipped Mint Cookies"" are no exception. These are not quite as good as regular cookies but, being diabetic friendly, are a good alternative.<br /><br />Recommended!"
"Murray ""Sugar Free Fudge Dipped Vanilla Wafer Cookies"" are a good tasting, diabetic friendly, snack food.<br /><br />While not quite a good as regular fudge dipped wafers, having a slightly odd after taste, these are quite acceptable.<br /><br />Recommended!"
"Love these cookies, and in quanity, and free shipping, makes it cheaper than the grocery store!"
Package arrived on time; however some of the packs were ripped.  Other than that it was satisfactory.
Great stuff. Didn't expect them to taste as good as they do. I bought four different kinds of Murray cookies and these are definitely top of the list (2nd on the list are the Oatmeal). Do not hesitate to purchase. You will not be disappointed unless you have a finicky palate. ENJOY!
These cookies really satisfy my sweet tooth for chocolate chip cookies. Very tasty and doesn't make me feel so sugar deprived.
"Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there.  But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite."
The Murray's pecan shortbread sugar-free cookies are my favorite of sugar-free cookies.  The grocery stores that I frequent didn<br />t seem  to stock these cookies.  The product is excellent.
"So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame."
"Sugar free bites are a great way to satisfy the sweet desire in all of us...but without unnecessary and unhealthy sugars and fats. The 80-calorie packs are perfect to throw in the snack drawer at work. Now, if Murray would only put some of its other non-chocolate choices into these packs, it would be great! (Sigh...yes, I love chocolate, but I'm a migraineur and chocolate is only a rare treat for me since it is a key migraine headache trigger...)"
Murray's Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread Cookies are my favorite cookies. They're delicious and perfect for someone who has to watch their blood sugar levels.
always like this cookies i used to get then from kellogs store but they closed up and sent me a letter telling me i could get from amazon  glad they did
Worth the price and trouble of buying them. Even if your not diabetic they will help you take sugar out of your diet.  These are by far NO regular diet cookies. There simply to good to pass up.  Get some.  I recommend it.
This is the best tasting sugar free shortbread cookie ever. Doesn't even taste sugar free.
These cookies are great for a diabetic.  4 cookies only have 10 carbs and they satisfy you desire for something sweet. They taste just like regular shortbread cookies.
It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good. They are buttery and rich tasting and a serving is 8 cookies of 130 calories. That is so filling and yet still keeps you on whatever plan you are following.<br /><br />I have tried many of the flavors of these cookies and not found one to be bad or have an aftertaste. This one is my all time favorite. You will not be disappointed. In my town they are usually $3.99 a pack so this is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />They come with a long expiration date also.
"I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P"
"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite."
"Short & sweet.  These chocolate delights are hard to find in many areas. I found them on Amazon & bought a case & will surely buy more. Just the thing for that ""Chocolate Fix""."
"All of Murray's Sugar Free Cookies are excellent, but my favorite is the Pecan Shortbread.  Delicious!"
"Have a family member that is diabetic, so I always keep some of these on hand for when we get together and standard sweets are not an option.  Very tasty.  They used Splenda, so that will be a pro or con to you, depending on if you like it.<br /><br />I am very thankful for these cookies for helping to provide a bit or normalcy for this family member.  Just like normal cookies, but sugar-free.  Several great varieties.  Worth a try if you are looking for a sugar-free cookie."
This definitely satisfies you when you need a little something sweet. I find I don't even have to eat too much of me to be satisfied. The taste is great and best of all it doesn't cause upset stomach like many other sugar-free products do.
"While I was in a coma I ate these for desert.  They are very good tasting, don't have any ""Sugary muck"" taste, just plain, but really filling and don't give me gas.<br /><br />I like them with iced tea or pelican juice.<br /><br />Since there's no Sugar in them you can leave them out in the sun without getting a diabetic seizure.  Ants don't like them for some reason."
"The last 2 cases of Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan were over cooked almost burnt.. Date Code is MAR0810EAS.  I don't have the code in front me  But I remember MAR0810Exx?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYGXKC"">Murray Sugar Free Cookies Chocolate Chip with Pecan, 5.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>"
I really want to know how much I'm paying per ounce. This product doesn't allow me to know that information. Needs to list how much is in the jar.
"Some of the beef tips were so gristly, I had to spit them out.  I won't buy this product again.  Of those pieces that were edible, the flavor was good."
"The steak with mushrooms was not nearly enough food for the money.  Even at the discounted price, it wasn't worth it.  Definitely not enough food for even 2 people."
"Omaha Steak products, although a little pricey, are worth the cost.  The meats are superb, as are the side dishes.  Haven't gone wrong with anything yet and I've been a customer for years."
"I am very into dessert teas and drink a good collection of them, both caffeinated and de-caffeinated.  One of my favorites was Celestial Seasonings Maple Vanilla Tea, but I can't get that tea these days.  So, I went looking for another brand with a maple flavor and decided to try this one.  I wasn't sure if the vanilla flavor not being there would be a detriment.  It turns out it's not necessary and I found another maple tea to enjoy.  It has a smooth and mile maple flavor."
"I selected this instead of the other brands of maple tea because it seemed like a good value.  When I opened the package, there was no maple smell at all, just a perfume smell.  Brewed a cup, took one sip and dumped out the rest of the cup.  It tasted of perfume.<br /><br />I brought the remaining bags to work and a couple months later there are still many left in the package and there are over 25 tea drinkers in the building."
"Simply Chex Cheddar is a really not-too-guilty snack that gives you the cheesey taste of Cheetos and the healthy crunch of Chex cereal. The fat content is 70% lower that regular chips, so if you are desperate for one of those naughty snacks, you might as well go for this variety of Chex Mix!<br /><br />Yum!"
"This is so good! And, it's great that there's a healthy amount of fiber in each serving. Then, great buy here on Amazon.  Now, I just have to control myself and eat only one serving!"
This is basically their wheat and rice chex covered in light cheese seasoning...simple and very good. Get em on sale for $1.50 or so and you are good to go!
"Amazon to the rescue!  Unable to locate product at any local groceries, so took a chance with the Internet.  Great grandson LOVES this product.  Better for him than soda. Usually don't purchase this way, but I was desperate.  Thank you!"
I purchased the cheese as a birthday present for my Girlfriend. She had never had triple Creame Bree before and was overwhelmed by the taste. The response time from the vendor was outstanding. It arrived at my house well before I expected it. So I give both the cheese and the vendor a thumbs up
"Honest Foods. Honest my Aunt Tilly. This item retails for $7.99 @ Costco, and you're selling it for $30.00. What are you sending in people to Costco to purchase and then hoard them so you can then bilk the public by $22.00 per selling unit. The public should know how you are ripping them off. This is a complete, and utter disgrace."
"Cookies arrived well, good condition, not a single one broken.<br />They are So good.... If you place them in fridge... they taste the best!"
I gave this to my dad for father's day and he got a real kick out of it. A great gift.
"I bought this at the same time I bought the 70s version. I had the same disappointment, and therefore the same review...<br /><br />I thought this was such a great idea, but when I saw what was actually delivered I was quite disappointed. The nostalgia conveyed by the box is cool, the rest, not so much. Hit up a Minit Mart or 7-11 and buy 3x the candy, put it in a gift bag, and throw in a card ""Remember the 60s"" for the same price."
"For the price of this item, I expected much more than I got.<br />I went to Cracker Barrel and got much more and the<br />same items."
"Awesome little box of candy, my mom loved it so much she showed it off to EVERYONE! It only has 1 of each candy, but the wax lips especially were a hit! I recommend this product, but I would of liked more of the candy."
"OK assortment for the price, but I've seen better versions that included more items... (at a higher price of course).  Was well received by the gift recipient."
"I got these on sale, a twofer.  I gave them to two friends for their 50th birthday!<br />They loved them!!<br />We had a lot of laughs remembering each candy as a child."
"We have been drinking White House Coffee for at least 30 years with the exception for about a year when we bought unroasted beans and roasted them ourselves. White House Coffee has been very consistent in quality and the vacuum pack with the nitrogen valve is a major factor in storage life. We have tried many varities but have always preferred Colombian Supremo. The 12 oz packs are very nice since they help keep the beans fresh and can be used up fairly quickly. We have relatives in Colombia and when we visited there we showed up with White House Colombian Supremo in our luggage! We even took our own Coffee Mate in one gallon plastic bags!!! We were probably the first people to bring a WHITE POWDER INTO COLOMBIA IN THEIR LUGGAGE :-) Luckily, our luggage was not searched in customs! Try White House Coffee and I think you will love it as we do. But if you visit Colombia leave the white powder at home - probably more prudent :-)"
"I thought I was going to get a ""light"" coffee bean. When I got my items the roast degree indicator on all 3 of my bags have a circle in the middle of the indicator. So what I received and what I see in the picture are 2 different things. I am going to contact amazon and see if they actually have the ""light"" roast like I wanted. I haven't tasted it yet because I want to see what amazon tells me so for now I can't give a full review and real ratings. I will be updating my review soon as I hear something back.<br /><br />Update: Ok the same day I wrote this review (yesterday) amazon got back to me extremely fast and I wasn't able to get back into this review to update until now. Anyway, An Amazon customer service rep sent me a very detailed e-mail which I felt was very informative and show overall great customer service. To sum things up, they don't have this coffee in the ""light"" roast. So now the only thing left to do is taste the coffee. I bought a coffee grinder from Amazon and I am still waiting for it to arrive and when it does. I will be back to finish my review. i'm adding 2 more stars for the fabulous customer service I received."
"Twin Bing is my wife's favorite candy from her ""younger days"".  We can't purchase it locally so I decided to try and find a box of them for her for a Valentine's Day surprise.  I searched Amazon.com and guess what... they had it!  And at a very reasonable price, too!  Also the box arrived on the day promised and was well packaged so not a single ""Bing"" was busted!  Great service!  Thanks Amazon and Twin Bing!"
"My husband introduced me to these, he grew up with them in Nebraska.  I love them, getting the whole box for him for Valentines Day,  whoops, there goes the diet.  They are well worth it.......yummy!!!"
"I aint no thang without that Bing. Best candy bar ever, grew up on them in South Dakota and always bring some back to Chicago. Get yo mind right and order some today. Really a great product, I wished they had a wider distibution area though."
"If you have never eaten a Twin Bing, it is like a Cherry Mash, but softer, and with higher quality ingredients and quite a bit better tasting.<br />I have been unable to find them locally here in the South.<br /><br />Highly recommend."
"Yum.... These are delicious.  My husband is from Iowa and introduced these to me.  We cannot get these in Michigan, unless I order online.  I have ordered directly from the company and my inlaws have been kind enough to send to us.<br /><br />They have a nutty milk chocolate outer shell and a cherry chewy center.  When we order a case, we will freeze and eat them frozen....."
these are great and a good price. My 2 year od grand daughter loves them and they are a very healthy snack. Paid much more at Fresh Market. A feew are broken but mainly in good shape.
"This coffee is so amazing, I recieved a small packet with my Monin (sugar free) Vanilla Syrup, and I was just going to throw it away because it didn't look appealing, so I opened it and the aroma.........................AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! Its truly the most amazing smell!!!!!! And the taste is DIVINE!!!!! I add some of my sugar free vanilla syrup with some almond milk.....WOW!!!!<br /><br />THIS COFFEE IS INCREDIBLE!!!!! I just ordered some more and I'll be ordering more and more!!!"
"If you like Chai...I would bet that you'd like THIS Chai better than the others that you've tried. I don't know why, but, personally...I just find this Good Earth Chai more satisfying than the others even though I do like the others. And, getting it this way saved me some money, too. Good deal."
"Seriously...the best...ever...I won't drink anything but Good Earth since finding this brand.  Armoatic, full bodied, subtle spices...excellent."
"good earth teas are phenomenal quality and flavor. i'm still on the fence about Chai's - as sometimes there's a weird spice like licorice in them [bad for men's testosterone, and weird in tea to me]<br />i think Good earth has got it right!<br /> plus i love Amazon subscribe and save!"
"Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two."
I didn't think I was going to like these berries because of the color and appearance but they are really good.  They are not sweet but a little tart.
The cats in my outdoor TNR program all ate this salmon down like lions. The food looked smelled good. Without amazons sales and super saver shipping I could never be able to care for all these wild cats. Thanks Nestle Purina Pet Care for a good product.
"My mother feeds her 3 dogs all sorts of Merrick foods. (Grammy's Pot Pie, Turducken, etc.) Her dogs all love it & the vet says Merrick is one of the best, as all the ingredients are natural with no preservatives or (*gasp!) roadkill or dog/cat meat added, as is common in the cheaper brands.<br /> My one complaint with Merrick is that I have seen weight gain in all of the dogs, although they are being fed a little under the recommended amount. They receive dry food for lunch & some canned Merrick for dinner. I think because of some of the sugars found in the fruits used & how heavy some of the food appears it is sticking to their bones more, so to speak.<br /> On the other hand, I cook my own dog food for my little ones (brown rice, ground beef/turkey, homemade veggies like zucchini, spinach, corn, carrots, celery with water to boil) & their weight is maintained at a healthy 9 lbs. When I had surgery I put them on Merrick for two weeks & they both reached 11 lbs. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it could be for little dogs.<br /> In the end I recommend Merrick as it is all natural & dogs love it. Just keep your eye on their weight & all will go well."
"My dogs really like this product, and I like it's all natural with no grains or byproducts added. My dogs eat both the dry and the canned Turducken."
"My dog has a ""sensitive"" stomach, meaning she vomits and has diarrhea whenever we switch foods.  However, I wanted her to have the healthiest food possible.  Merrick is the best, especially Turducken.  She loves it, no stomach issues, and I love that the ingredients are real food - organic chicken being the main one!"
my 4 year old dog statred having seizures when she was 2 yrs old. She is on two diffrent meds to help control them. Still she would have 2 a month. I started her on Merrick in December 2011. She had a mild one in March. Thats the only one all year. I really think the Merrick dog food has made a HUGE diffrence.
My dogs love the wet/can version so I thought I would buy them some dry to mix with the can.  They seem to look at it just like any other dry dog food.  Maybe they are spoiled.  But at least they claim the products are natural and the Merrick brand seems to be nutritious overall.
"So I spent hours researching dog foods- I wanted something not outrageously expensive but also did not contain all the horrible things we're told not to feed our dogs. I read reviews that said people's dogs didn't like the food, got sick, etc. I assumed those were picky or old dogs. My dogs generally love eating time and will eat anything from frogs to cat poo-- lovely.<br />Anyway- my younger dog begs me not to make him eat the food. I mixed in soft food just so he'd eat it. They dogs have been constipated, throwing up, diarrhea-- the whole nine yards. I isolated other factors to make sure it was the food- continued to feed it to them for a week- and just finished scrubbing the carpet again. Enough. I was so excited to find 'good' food. Too bad my dogs hate it."
"I absolutely love this Cat Butt Gum.  When I chew it I instantly feel warm and fuzzy!  At first I was a litte reluctant to try it because of the name but after opening the box and trying a piece out, I realized that I love the taste and smell of Cat Butt.  The cute box is just a plus!"
This was a hilarious gift that I gave to my co-workers.  They loved it! Sometimes we pass it to each other when we are having a bad day :)
It is very tiny for the price ....I think if was a case of 50 I would have been happy.
"This is great flour but who in their right mind would pay $54 for 30lbs of flour, plus another $45 for shipping? You can buy a 5lb bag of this flour at any grocery store for less than $4."
"More than $50 in price, 5 pounds in weight and with 6 packages of flour in total, this perhaps the most outrageous food item available on Amazon.com. I can't think of a reason why you'd order it in this fashion- 6 packs of flour can't possibly run this much in a store, and you don't have to pay for shipping there. If you have a little over $50 that ain't doing much and a need for 6 packs of King Arthur 100% organic flour, I'd say this is a good buy. Otherwise, buy what flour you need in a store. King Arthur flour is, in my experience, as good as it gets. Don't eat it straight, though. That isn't what it's for and you'll see why few people do it if you try. It's not dangerous, though. But flour, King Arthur brand or not, isn't supposed to be eaten straight out of the bag."
"While 100% Organic Whole Wheat Flour has no equal, King Arthur Flour is a wonderful addition as an alternative Flour with different characteristics than White Flour, namely White Flour in a Blue/White bag."
I tried these for the first time and the cocolate taste is weak and the sweetness is very strong.  I almonst taste like flavored sugar water with a hint of cocoa.
"I agree with the other guy. I bought these even after reading his review, thinking that maybe it was just a palatial difference. Honestly, it just tastes like hot water with a hint of chocolate. You're better off buying normal hot chocolate and using your Vue's hot water dispenser."
"We received a shaved ice machine as a gift, a Japanese style one that makes very fine shaved ice, and we searched far and wide for good, authentic shaved ice syrup.  I had never heard of this brand before but decided to give it a shot.  The shipping was expensive, $10, the same price as 2 bottles of syrup but it was worth it.  The bottles are on the smaller side but the flavor is amazing.  Reminds me of my childhood.  We bought the cherry and grape flavor and eat it almost every night!  This is the real stuff.  I would recommend ordering several bottles at once because it is so good that you'll run out quickly."
"Too much food coloring used to turn it a DARK blood red (I think it's ""Black Cherry"" and being mislabled as ""Cherry"").  Also has a funny aftertaste.  Lived in Hawaii and this is NOTHING like the cherry flavoring used in ""Shaved Ice"" in Hawaii.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
"I've bought Cameroonian arabica beans from a Co-OP in the Northwest Province.  These were the sweetest, richest coffee beans I've ever tasted.  Too bad the government had to put the local growers out of business.  I'd hoped to find the taste of these beans to be in the same league;  but, no dice.  They were a decent bean, but not for the price."
"Oh my, these are delicious, I love them. I've found one or two walnuts that were old, too hard to chew or too salty, but overall quality is good. I would give 4 stars for those few bad ones, but they taste too yummy for 4 stars."
"I love eating nuts as a snack, in part because I can pretend they're healthy.  Plain walunts can be a bit bland, and I wanted something that wasn't chocolate covered.  These omega munchies hit the spot.  (I have to portion them out so I won't eat the entire bag in one sitting!)  Even my husband, who has a habit of using the words ""cinnamon"" and ""too much"" in the same sentence likes them.  They're sweet, crunchy and a good source of omega-3, which is great because who wants to snack on salmon to boost their omega-3 intake?  It's hard to get groceries like this from Amazon because you have to get so much at once, but it's worth the risk.  My second time ordering them, I decided to do a ""subscribe and save"" order.  I don't see myself wanting to look for a different snack anytime soon."
"These are sooooo good! If you have a sweet tooth and are searching for something healthy, try them, you won't be sorry!!"
"Hunting for gluten-free snacks on Amazon, I found these delicious munchies. The ingredient list is simple: walnuts, evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, flaxseed, cinnamon, & sea salt. A healthy, guilt-free, gluten-free snack, and it comes in a resealable pouch. I will be ordering more!"
"I tried these at the organic food show in Chicago.  I could have eaten them all day.  Cinnamon, flaxseed, and walnuts are very nutritious!"
I LOVE the Sassafras kits.  I have bought about 18 of them in the last few years for gifts.  There are many of them for boys and girls if you just search Sassafras they will pull up.  I always buy a book that cordanates with the kit that is a reader book since most of the gifts have gone to 5 and 6 year olds.  I have never had any shipping issues and they have always come bubble wrapped and in great shape.  These are really fun and cute.  I have 7 in a closet right now bacause with 3 kids there is always a birthday party to go to!
"Saw these on Amazon and thought they would make great gifts for my nieces and nephew. When they arrived, the box was dirty and scuffed up. The corners of the boxes were caved in. I guess the saying ""learn the hard way"" comes into play here, buy local not online!"
"These brownies from Cocoa (the shop in Larchmont) are quite simply the very best  -- in taste, quality, and appearance.  Giftworthy, if you can bear to part with them.  True elegance for chocolate connoisseurs."
I am disappointed in this product because I presumed that simple green tea would have a natural flavor and nothing else.  Wrong.  And the taste is on the weak side.  Not my 'cup of tea'.
"I bought this for my wife because she was looking for a change of pace from her usual mandarin orange spice tea. She was disappointed in that the tea had very little discernible cranberry flavor. Green teas are generally much milder (at least to me), but I had to agree that this one is too weak. I love iced green tea with lemon, but I am not a big hot tea drinker. Since you must buy the 2-pack from Amazon, I would suggest you really consider if you want to experiment. We won't be buying it again, but some might like it."
WOW!!!!! I had this tea once before thought it was great but I just got some from Amazon and yuk!!! Has no taste very weak you can't taste any cranberry this tea almost taste old???? How dissapointing???
"Can't really  rate - it tasted very good, but did not agree with me.<br /><br />I'm sure the tea was first rate, but it just didn't agree with me."
A cup of this tea is a big part of my day and my diet to lose weight. It is just plain good.
"I use the cranberry green twist tea as ice tea. I brew it as usual and pour it over a 32 ounce mug filled with ice.  It's wonderful, not sweet, and very refreshing!"
"Save your money much better teas out there.  Try the Celstial Seasonings Mandarin Orange Spice Tea and the India Spice Chai Tea.  Both have great flavor.  This is a waste of money.  I have tried about 10 teas to date, by far the worse one.  Thank goodness you can order sampler sizes at Keurig."
I like it so much because of the great health benefits of Green tea and cranberries!!
These bottles arrived when they said they would  and were wrapped securely. The juice is much better tasting then I had anticipated. I highly reccomend it.
i first bought this at whole foods. the taste blew me away! one try and you will go nuts looking . go find out for yourself!
"If you've ever had hummus from a can (or from chickpeas dried or not), this stuff will taste awful to you. It's powder you mix with water. No matter how much olive oil or garlic or lemon juice or salt you add you can't get rid of  that animal feed flavor."
"Wow, this Hummus mix is great.  Tastes really good and fits into my diet as a perfect snack because it is high in protein, high in fiber, and low in fat.  I like it on celery."
"I've gone through a lot of this hummus product.  A little bland, nicely leaving room to add one's own favorite spices to vary the mix readily."
This is the best dried hummus I've found.  It has a mild flavor and thus can be mixed with a variety of spices for a customized taste.
This is a great product and it's so fast and easy to fix.  It's made made from all natural ingredients and has a rich chickpea flavor with a hint of garlic and lemon.  You can add extra garlic and lemon to taste if you like but it's fine just as is.  I like to add a touch of hot Hungarian Paprika and EVO.  It's a healthy snack and goes great with beer.  Our fantasy football league loves this stuff.
i first had this candy bar  30 years ago or more. then it was gone.  jus t found it in california and colorada.  they dont sell it in  the east. it was sooooo good that i ordered more from amazon. it's the only way to get it here in florida and new york.
"I'm a true chocoholic, and this chocolate bar, along with kit kats are absolutely THE best, love it. Creamy marshmallow, covered in a thin layer of chocolate and sprinkled with nuts, what else in life do you need??"
"enjoyed these when I was a kid and still like them...it is a good combination of chocolate, marshmellow and pecans."
"The box was smashed up, didn't look new as advertised.It didn't taste like the one my mother used to buy for me and my sister when we were kids."
"These candy bars are marvelous.  My box arrived in two days with my Prime Shipping and the candy bars are big, Fresh and delicious. So great to find a source for these old-timey yummy treats. I'm glad the weather had cooled down so the chocolate survived the shipping just fine.  I ordered another box because I know these will disappear fast."
"I first met this coffee while traveling in Mexico during the early 1980's. I enjoyed it very much. My father also was spending time in Mexico, and he wrote to Nescafe and asked why they were not selling it in the USA. The answer? 'Americans don't like strong tasting coffee' was the answer from Nescafe. Thirty years later, and countless 'strong' coffee shops later, they were proved wrong. I am very happy to be able to purchase this product on American store shelves now. However, I was not happy to see that Amazon is charging $7 a jar, when the going price in every 'normal' grocery store I have been in is under $5, generally around $4.78. I would love to purchase from Amazon, but please, try charging the going rate, or close to it."
"I drink mostly instant coffee.  I drink it black.  I like a strong, but not harsh flavor.  This is one of my favorites (along with Taster's Choice).  It is a fully flavored, smooth tasting, robust instant coffee.  At the usual prices, it is a very good value, costing less than many.  It also has a nice coffee smell which is an important part of the experience.<br /><br />Thanks, Nescafe, for continuing to make this available!"
"This is an edit to my original review in which I stated I felt the lid wasn't ergonomic. I'm retracting that statement because now I have no problems with opening the lid.<br /><br />I agree with reviewer T. Salazar that there is a bitter aftertaste, which is tolerable for me, but I was a little disappointed at first. I only take cream with my coffee. Now I'm getting used to it, but my usual instant coffee of choice is a toss-up between Yuban and Maxwell House. I wanted to try this out because on Amazon each bottle comes out to be a couple of bucks cheaper than how much they sell Yuban and Maxwell House at my local grocery store (not to mention I wanted to try something different)."
"First time I tasted this coffee, it was in Vegas, at a restaurant inside the Hard Rock. I complimented the waitress on it, and she let it slip that it was instant coffee.<br /><br />I bought some when I get home, and you know what? It typically beats any $4 cup from the regular suspects... seriously, make it strong, then put in some French Vanilla creamer and you will not believe how simulaneously strong and creamy a concoction can be... like Thai Iced Coffee but better.<br /><br />Did I mention this dissolves effortlessly in COLD water? Toss in some Truvia. Yum."
"Nescafe is simply my favorite coffee brand, even though their prices have went up in the last few years. I have switched to other instant coffees, but all of them taste like dishwater. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G2JISO"">Nescafe Classic Instant Coffee, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> has the best smoothest taste."
"For instant, I would rate this very good. It has a great flavor. I use it when I just need a cup and do not want to brew an entire pot but want a good cup of coffee.  Glass bottle is a great way to store it, seems things kept in glass just taste better and last longer over plastics."
"I am not a big fan of instant offe but this one is very good, maybe the best one among instant coffee."
The picture shows the old package of this coffee i couldn't find anywhere. That was the reason i made an order. I was dissapointed to receive diffent jars.<br />But it turned out to be the  same product.
"Such good coffee! Yes, it's instant, but as one reviewer mentioned, a live orchestra sounds better than a CD, but does that fact invalidate the CD? Why would it? Nestl&eacute; produces this coffee specifically for the latino/a market; I live close to the Mexican border and for the most part I've found freshly brewed coffee in Baja California is similar to freshly brewed in Alta California and usually very good to excellent. This is a product to keep on hand for quick cups of java; it's not quite the real thing, but consider my CD comparison that's also not exactly a live musical performance, but like Nestl&eacute; Clasico, can be an extremely pleasant addition to any day. PS Please don't purchase this through Amazon; it's lots less expensive if you can find it in your local market."
"Nescafe Clasico is my all-time favorite. In fact, I like it so much, that I stopped brewing coffee from beans at home (I get Starbucks/Peet's drip-coffee at work). The flavor is complex and without any unpleasant aftertaste. I drink 3-4 cups a day, and never get tired of it."
"I'm a bit of a coffee addict, but with my current living conditions I can't have a coffee maker. I bought a 3-pack of Nescafe Clasico based on all the positive reviews, and I'm not disappointed! While instant coffee will never be as delicious as the real thing, this coffee is really quite good. I've tried a few instant coffees (Starbucks, Folgers, and some others), and this is my favorite by far. It's slightly bitter, but I have no problem drinking it without creamer."
"ASHAME that amazon will not offer this product at ""Subscribe and save"" anymore, it broke my heart, is a fantastic instant coffee, better than anything out there in the market... no comparison."
"PROS<br /><br />1) It is inexpensive.<br />2) It works by keeping you awake and alert.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1) It has a bitter/burnt taste right after drinking this coffee. I was able to tolerate it at the beginning, but then I hated it.<br />2) Nescafe Taster's Choice (house blend) has a better taste than this coffee. It doesn't have this bitter taste at the end. But this coffee is a bit more expensive."
With it's own typical strong taste..<br />Like Taster's Choice also but this one surely tastes better..<br />With little quantity you can make it taste from mild to strong..
Cheaper than Costco and other stores. Initially the item came with a broken bottle. Called Amazon customer service and they promptly replaced the order. That is why I shop at Amazon. Good customer service and best price.
"This is the BEST INSTANT COFFEE you can buy,it is the only instant coffee that has a strong robust flavor.<br />You can't beat the price!If you can find it in stores it sells for anywhere from $5.89 to $7.79 per jar in my area."
"Simply put, at least for my taste, this is the best instant coffee you can find in the grocery.  I'll buy nothing else.<br />Also, through Amazon, was able to find one of the best prices for this product with savings of about $2.00 off per jar compared to local grocer."
"I usually enjoy Nestle Nescafe coffees, but the ""Clasico"" variety is truly horrible; I am surprised. I tried it once a few years back, and again last week to see if they improved the flavor recently, but no. ""Clasico"" is still vile and bitter. I had to return it to the store."
I love the taste of this coffee. I am like many others who don't like the strong taste of brewed coffee. And in most restaurants that is what I always end up with. With instant you can adjust it to your own taste. I drink probably about the equivalent of three cups every morning. I do it within a large thermal mug that can be taken with me. I use a heaping spoonful for the flavor I want. When I get down to half a jar I am picking up another jar for backup. At a little over $5 I will pay whatever the price for this particular brand.
I love tamales and this brand is very good for canned tamales..I am pleased with my choice..Thank you Amazon for speedy service..
"Spearmint Altoids used to be my favorite!  The last order I received advertised in a Yellow banner - ""NEW GREAT TASTE! SAME PUNCH!""  Altoids has moved from ""Naturally"" flavored to ""Naturally and Artificially Flavored.""  The mints have a bite now and an undesirable aftertaste.  Sadly, I will never purchase these again and after decades of my favorite mint, I now have to bid a sad farewell.  If you are a fan of the good ol' Spearmint Altoids, do not buy these."
It's great to be able to order Altoids Spearmints on line because they are often hard to find in stores and they're my favorite.  The price is better than locally too.  I would have given this company 5 stars but they sent me the wrong product.  They  were very good at correcting the problem in a timely fashion.  I'll be ordering again!
"Illy espresso beans are my favorite of all the widely available commercially produced roasted espresso beans. This is the standard medium roast that Illy produces and it is a bit less aggressive and milder tasting than the dark roasts of Lavazza (the other major Italian brand that some people favor).<br /><br />When properly ground, tamped, and brewed Illy espresso has a delightful aroma and flavor, unmatched by any of the other brands.<br /><br />Granted, Illy is quite pricey, and I do not use it all the time for this reason. However, you get what you pay for. Usually, I buy my espresso from a small roasting house in the Midwest that produces a decent medium roast substitute that I do not mind using most of the time. But Illy definitely produces a higher quality bean.<br /><br />One way to judge the quality of roasted espresso beans even before you taste the coffee that they will produce is to look at the evenness of color and size of the beans. The reason is that beans of a uniform size tend to roast more evenly than beans of varying sizes. Moreover, even when the beans are of a uniform size, it is important that they be roasted in small batches and churned during the the entire roasting process to ensure that they all get roasted to the same point. This is why most high quality coffee is roasted in small batches in a rotating drum that roasts all the beans to the exact same point. Moreover, since the moisture content of the beans varies a bit from batch to batch, quality control in the roasting process is extremely important. And it is here that Illy is unmatched. Just do a simple visual comparison of the color and consisteny of Illy beans when compared to any of the other widely available brands and you can easily see why Illy is the best."
"Coffee taste is a personal preference. I love coffee and Illy medium roast espresso beans are among my favorites. That's not why I buy Illy for the office however. I buy it for use in my office because the beans stay perfectly fresh in the super sturdy sealed cans for a very long time. Three month old cans open as fresh as 3 day old cans. So, I can buy 6 cans at a time, and never run out!"
"usually i like la vazza super creama and i call it my number one bean to run through my auto espresso maker but sometimes i like illy, its more robust with a good coffee flavor.<br /><br />i will continue to buy it for my espresso maker."
I lived in Italy for six years and found most Italians thought this was the best commonly available coffee;  I use it in a Saeco Odea Giro (purchased in Italy and used here with a transformer) with filtered water and find the taste in the US to be identical to what I made in Italy.
"I'm a bit of a coffee snob, not a total fanatic but I have tried just about every variety under the sun, enjoy my espresso and lattes, have a favorite local coffee shop where I buy locally-roasted espresso... we have all the appropriate equipment at home and enjoy a latte every morning.<br /><br />This Illy medium-roast is seriously delicious stuff. It really is extremely high-quality, perfectly roasted, nutty coffee that produces a wonderful, creamy espresso. We've had the red-top Illy a couple of times over the years and it has always been a delightful treat.<br /><br />The downside: price. The locally-roasted locally-designed blend I buy (Global Village Organic Coffee, Raleigh, NC) is our staple espresso and has been for 12 years. The price inches up every few years and we now find it at $12.50/lb, which is fair for a pound of GOOD espresso (not the cigarette ash taste of Starbucks - why stop roasting there? Why not just leave the beans going for another 30 seconds and turn them in to pure carbon?). This Illy comes in at, approximately, $25/lb, about double (or even triple) what you need to spend to get a VERY good coffee bean to brew.<br /><br />I guess it depends what you're looking for. For us, it's a very nice treat, something a little different in the hopper, a little special, with a long shelf life and comes out fresh when you pop open the can. But there's no way we'd buy it on a regular basis; it will never be a staple. There are other varieties (right here on Amazon!) that are comparable for 1/3 of the cost per pound, and local options available in most cities that may be comparable or better.<br /><br />Still... Illy is VERY good. Worth trying at least once!"
"I tried this coffee first from Williams Sonoma.  Although it is a little pricey like all their things, some things are just worth extra.  If you enjoy good coffee--give it a try.  I think it is $13.95 from WS--so this is actually a better deal."
"...how come Amazon stopped selling it under Amazon Prime? I once bought this regularly, but I won't if I have to pay shipping and wait for much longer than 2 days for delivery."
"I made my own chocolate squares using xylitol, stevia,cacao butter, and poured over gogi berries and almonds.  OMG, so yummy, no guilt indulgence."
"after testing many different orbit gum flavors, i've concluded wintermint has the longest lasting flavor. This is a pretty good deal, as long as you chose the free shipping option."
"Big League Chew... Bubble Tape... Hubba Bubba... Wrigley's... now Orbit.<br /><br />Thus the progression of chewing gum taste from childhood to adulthood.  What's not to like?  The Wintermint flavor is refreshing and long-lasting (I typically get at least a half-hour's worth of chewing from each piece) and I'm sure my dentist appreciates that it's free of sugar.<br /><br />I've only had good experiences buying in bulk (24, 14-piece packs) with expiration dates always at least a year away.  YMMV."
"Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime.  One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth.  Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price.  Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle.  But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out.  What more, it cleans your teeth.  No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of ""Juicy Fruit"".  Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944.  Distributed to US soldiers during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health.  It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States."
"I really like this gum, cool and free sugar and also clean teeth thankss"
"Literally every time we go to the store, my husband has to pick up a pack of these. He LOVES them. They are very sour but different! It's nice to mix it up once and a while & get a shock. Just writing about them makes my mouth water! The flavors are very good, green apple, watermelon, & tangerine. They are also a great snack consitering they are sugar free! Adds some flavor to the mouth during the day when you just don't feel like a piece of minty gum!"
"It is nice and refreshing, but I might have taken too many of them without letting my teeth to have a break.  The acid might have worn out some of my teeth and they became very sensitive."
"Love these mints to keep my breathe fresh and my mouth busy, without having to ingest needless calories.  Only thing to be aware of is that the ""mint"" can actually burn the inside of your mouth if you eat too many over a short period of time!"
"Great taste and fun to share. Take one while I am driving, having meeting, or meet with friends."
"While I did get Ice Breakers, I did not get the Pink Lemonade, I merely got the Apple, Tangerine and Watermelon sours. Tasty, but misleading. I give 3 stars since I didn't bother to return em."
"I enjoy making green chile. I have not been able to find canned green chiles in any of the local stores, This is the second time I have ordered from EMBASA. Delivery was as expected, The chiles were great, very satisfied with the product, and the chiles tasted excellent."
"Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though.  Somehow thought the cheese would be in a gift box similar to the one shown, not just stuffed into dismal styrofoam.  I'm not certain what to make of the leaking eplorateur that was rewrapped in some plastic wrap....hmmm..wonder if it was shipped out that way or someone had opened the container  -it's below freezing here, so doubt it ""thawed"" en route<br /><br />will probably go out for dinner or to the jeweler next year"
My sister and her husband are enjoying every mouthful of the wonderful cheeses. Do not let it go by without trying them.
"I was disappointed to get the cheese melted in the box upon arrival - it made quite a mess. Informed Customer Service and they sent another cheese right away. Unfortunately, it was even more melted the second time. Igourmet did reimbuse for the one cheese variety that melted... I was still stuck cleaning up the mess of melted cheese on the other two warm varieties.  Perhaps not a good idea for anyone in a hot climate... especially if your ordering for a special occasion."
"I ordered a pound of nigella seeds for $7.99.  I received 7 ounces, in a package clearly labeled as containing that amount.  I have never used these seeds before so I can't even tell if it's the right thing in the package.  The same Amazon vendor (""SimplyBeautiful"") offers six 7-ounce packages of this product for $14.98.<br /><br />I ain't happy.  I never want to order from these ""SimplyBeautiful"" stinkers again. My advice to others: don't trust ""SimplyBeautiful"", don't trust their products.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I got a refund on this purchase.  Still think the stuff tastes like nasty medicine, which may be what some want (long history as herbal cure-all) but not me.  Still don't want to deal with ""SimplyBeautiful"" again."
"I love Cheerwine.  I don't drink sodas very often, but I make an exception to enjoy Cheerwine whenever I find it.  It's got a great cherry taste and very refreshing.  Note this, however:  the formula they use in the plastic bottles contains high fructose corn syrup, whereas the formula for the glass bottles uses real sugar.  I prefer the glass bottles (b/c of the real sugar and b/c glass bottles preserve carbonation longer than plastic bottles).  That's it!"
"Cheerwine is a regional soda from North Carolina, that has expanded into 12 other southeast states in the last 8 years. Started in 1917, Cheerwine was first formulated in the basement of L. D. Peeler's wholesale grocery store. Created during prohibition when it was common to name sodas after liquors. The owner added a new cherry flavor syrup to his previous soda and cheerwine was born. Believe it or his great grandsons still run the company.<br />The bergundy red soft drink has a nice mellow cherry flavor, and the color is really a pretty burgundy color, almost like wine. It is more subtle and seems less sweet on the palate than the grocery store house brands of cherry soda. No aftertaste or bite. It is easy to see why the locals in North Carolina rave about this and the other drink from this company, ""Cool Moon"".  Also made in diet soda."
"I expected more of a ""bite"" or a real powerful cherry burst of flavor, but the drink seemed rather mild. It was OK."
"This is good stuff and deserves five stars, really.  I use it all the time and was very happy Amazon was offering it at a good price and free-shipping eligible.  It's now standard in my home.<br /><br />Why only four stars?  Because I found a sauce even better, the Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce.  However, who wants only one of this general category of sauce?  These two are quite different and both delicious.  Make your egg rolls really, really happy with both."
"Like many others, I have been looking for a decent replacement for the restaurant-style sweet and sour sauce.  I know it isn't the most healthy thing to consume, but it sure is good.  This is as close as I have found to the ""real"" stuff.  It is very similar in appearance, texture, and taste.  It seems to have more of a vinegar smell to it than the real stuff, but the taste is not overpowering in the vinegar department.  I think the key difference between this stuff and the other stuff out there is the fact that this is labeled as being ""Hawaiian style.""  It did not really register for me until I started thinking about it.  Once, while at a tiny little Chinese restaurant, I remember seeing a sweet and sour sauce container that boasted a ""Hawaiian style"" and it had large chunks of veggies and pineapple in it.  After thinking about it, this stuff seems to be very similar.  This does not have large chunks of anything in it, though.  It is just the sauce.<br /><br />If you are looking for the stuff you find in restaurants and you cannot find it elsewhere, give this a shot.  It is not dead on, but it is really close.  Even though there is a slight taste difference, it is not as bad as some of the others out there."
"This is the only sweet and sour sauce that I can find in the grocery stores that my 11 year old son will eat. I've been using it for years along with cooking up store-bought frozen chicken nuggets (or my own homemade chicken or turkey nuggets) as a replacement to taking him out to his favorite fast food restaurant. I've served it up to his friends and they all seem to love it too, so I definitely recommend it for kids. Love it myself too.<br /><br />It definitely tastes a lot closer to what you'll find in Chinese-American restaurants. All the other bottled sweet and sour sauces seem to be spicy/hot or aren't sweet at all. This one definitely isn't spicy and is sweet like it should be.<br /><br />Its been getting a little more difficult finding this in the grocery stores lately, and it always seems to go fast when anyone does have it in stock. I'm really glad to find it here on Amazon, with free super saver shipping, and such a great deal on sale! It may be a pack of 6 bottles, but I usually have to stock up when I can find it anyhow, so its worth it. Thanks Amazon."
"I saw this at Target and pulled it up on Amazon to check the reviews. They were great! So I bought a jar (very expensive compared to other peanut butter) and brought it home. I opened it up immediately excited to try it based on the great reviews and couldn't even eat a spoonful of it. Disgusting is the only the word I can think of, it tastes like a combination of sea water (it is SOOO salty) and synthetic peanut butter. All I have to say is, don't order in bulk until you try it and know you like it. Yuck!"
"This is the best low-fat, lower-calorie PB I've ever had.  I will never buy another jar of regular PB again."
"I was skeptical when I heard about this peanut butter because I wondered how they removed the fat from peanuts that are naturally fatty, and what would it taste like.  Well I absolutely love this peanut butter because they just drained some fat and replaced it with other natural and organic products.  This is definitely must try after searching everyone for one jar, I finished that then bought the case."
"What an excellent product!  Tastes awesome! Given that prices of peanut butter are going to skyrocket, this is an awesome alternative!"
I ordered a case of this peanut butter in chocolate and regular.  The chocolate has a funny taste and it's going to waste.  The original is pretty good but too salty.  I won't order this again.
"This is absolutely the best there is!  Prior to my relocation, I could find this product at Trader Joes and SuperTarget.  Alas, I can not find it anywhere here as no TJ's or SuperTarget.... It is the lowest Weight Watcher point (old and new plan) peanut butter out there and I have tried lots of them.  Does have to be refrigerated after opening and gets a little stiff, but well worth the small effort to spread it.  Amazon, bring it on!!!!"
"Yes, this paste is definitely sweeter than PB, but it is oh so good. I am a WW member and it is lower both in Points and PointsPlus (new plan) than any regular/reduced fat peanut butter out there. It is my favorite food discovery of 2010!"
"This product is not better than peanut butter.  It is worse -- far, far worse, the flavor does not even resemble peanut butter, and the ingredient list is filled with bizarre things.  I threw the whole jar away after one taste.  PB2 is far better than this and contains only peanuts, salt & sugar."
This product is so tasty and a great substitute for regular peanut butter for the whole family even those who aren't trying to lose weight. I discovered this product when I went to a health and fitness camp in America and wish that it was availible where I live in Australia but at the moment this is the only way to get the stuff.
Coffee does not taste as fresh as would have expected for the price and product reputation.  Would seriously consider other alternatives.
I have never had raw chocolates this good.  I have purchased just about every raw chocolate they have at whole foods and none of them stack up to this one.  I plan to buy a whole lot more!
I'm sure the product is just fine but my dog won't eat it which is funny since he does eat the dry Kibbles 'n Bits.  I guess he doesn't like the texture.  I have friends whose dogs eat this product.
"This 6-pack of cuttlefish is a pretty good deal when you compare it to the single packs listed at Amazon.  Saki Ika is delicious, and a great source of protein.  Put down those potato chips!"
This tastes very sweet compared to other brands that I have tried.  I ended up not eating it because it seems to have too much sweetener in it.  I like my fish salty.
"I bought these squid packs because a friend shared some with me and I really enjoyed them. I couldn't find them in Austin, but was super psyched to find them on Amazon.  I really enjoyed eating the 1st squid bag.  However, by the time I got to the 3rd squid bag, I was sick of them.  Now I have 3.5 more gross squid bags that I do not want to eat.  Has this ever happened to you?  I hope not."
"With the seaweed sushi nori, you have to be careful with, especially the ones from China.  A lot of them have added chemicals, or are manufactured in questionable ways.  Eden Foods is a company that really cares about the quality of their products from the research I have spent online, reading about their company, from the material they sent me after I inquired, and from finding out that a lot of their Japanese products are imported from Japan from a very reputable company.  They do business with companies that produce the products in the traditional way (for ex. their soy sauce, tamari, toasted sesame oil), while maintaining the products integrity. It's pricey, but it's worth the money knowing you are eating food that is safe to eat.  This brand is often sold at Whole Foods, and other health stores.  I buy several items from their line, especially the toasted sesame oil, all of their various seaweed, soy sauce/tamari, mirin, and some of their noodles.  I respect this company and am pleased that they try to keep their products natural...and no...I do not work for this company.  I'm just really into organics, and food that is safe for our bodies, and this company gets A+ marks in that category from me."
"This is the only nori I will buy!  Be careful of other brands like Pacific Cove, who sources from China!  This nori comes from Japan, and the company, Eden Foods, is an upstanding company.  When the Japan earthquake occurred, they put up informational notices on their website informing everyone of what had been hit hard, what products could be contaminated, and were going to be sourced elsewhere.<br /><br />I DO NOT WORK FOR THEIR COMPANY!  But I really love Eden!  They are not owned by a major company, as many organic brands have sold out to bigger corporations:General Mills owns Muir Glen and Cascadian Farm<br /><br />* Heinz owns Hain, Breadshop, Arrowhead Mills, Garden of Eatin', Farm Foods, Imagine Rice (and Soy) Dream, Casbah, Health Valley, DeBoles, Nile Spice, Celestial Seasonings, Westbrae, Westsoy, Little Bear, Walnut Acres, Shari Ann's, Mountain Sun, and Millina's Finest<br /><br />* M&M-Mars owns Seeds of Change<br /><br />* Coca-Cola owns Odwalla<br /><br />* Kellogg owns Kashi, Morningstar Farms, and Sunrise Organic<br /><br />* Philip Morris/Kraft owns Boca Foods and Back to Nature<br /><br />* Tyson owns Nature's Farm Organic<br /><br />* ConAgra owns LightLife<br /><br />* Danone owns Stonyfield Farm<br /><br />* Dean owns White Wave Silk, Alta Dena, Horizon, and The Organic Cow of Vermont<br /><br />* Unilever owns Ben and Jerry's<br /><br />This company is very proud and in tune with the organic movement, unlike many other companies now producing organic foods and interested only in profit.<br /><br />Now, back to the Nori, I have eaten a TON of nori in my lifetime.  This is certainly not the most tastiest toasted nori, but it is not terrible either.  As far as taste goes, I give it a 3.5 to 4 stars.  But it's the only nori I consume, because I know it was harvested from clean waters, and is less likely to be laden with chemicals in the manufacturing process since it is produced in partnership with Eden foods."
"one of the best meals is steamed rice (even brown rice will work - doesn't have to be sushi rice!) seasoned a little and then rolled up in some Eden sushi nori - especially when whatever else sounds good is thrown in too, like fried egg, avocado, carrots, or cucumbers."
Great source of iodine.  A bit dry if eaten out of the package -- better in soup.
"I just received the Salmon, the Duck and the Chicken strips.<br />Our JRT is very fussy and horribly spoiled.<br />She turns up her nose and walks away from many treats I've tried.<br />Most of the ""organic"" or ""healthy"" treats I've tried haven't won her over.<br /><br />She just had one each of the Salmon, Duck and Chicken and LOVED all of them!<br /><br />I'm thrilled that they are made in the US and contain ingredients I approve of.<br />Thank you Plato and Amazon!"
"I am always looking for healthy treats for my Wheaten and the fewer ingredients the better. I thought I found the best product when I found Waggin Train Chicken Jerky at Costco. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and, well, it scared the crap out of me. So now, I look for healthy treats with few ingredients, that are made in the US. I feel comfortable giving my dog these treats because I know the ingredients used are regulated. My dog LOVES these and so do I."
Well I've never tasted them but both my collie and mini-dh love these things. Some treats are hit or miss but they line up at the drawer waiting for these so they get 5 stars from us.
"I read about the most recent scare with chicken jerky made in China and promptly returned $55 worth of jerky strips and wrapped rawhide sticks back to Petco.  These Plato organic strips were my next test before making my own - and one bag of each flavor was cheaper than the Chinese jerky I purchased!  We haven't received the salmon flavor yet but my dog seems to like both the chicken and duck flavors very much.  I was a little surprised at the product itself, given it is called a ""strip,"" but looks more like a cookie than anything else.  Still, it's nice to find something made in the USA, with no corn, soy, or wheat gluten.  I will continue to buy these if my dog continues to eat them."
"I used to feed my then two month old puppy chicken jerky treats from Sams. It was cheap and he LOVED it. However, he started getting bloody diarrhea. This happened twice before I finally realized it was the jerky by researching this online. Since my puppy was also eating Greenies, Zuke's chicken treats, Milk Bones, Milk Bones Trail Mix, Iams Puppy dog food, Royal Canin food (digestion formula), puppy vitamins, Platos chicken treats, Natures Recipe food and treats, his puppy trainer's treats, and Benadryl (he has dermatitis), it was hard to pinpoint what the cause was. But once I figured it out, I stopped the Waggin Train and switched to Platos. Although these treats are more expensive and contain preservatives, it does seem a better alternative to liver failure or sudden death some pet owners were experiencing with chicken jerky treats.<br /><br />As for the seemingly biased reviews against jerky treats coming from China, I am a first generation Chinese immigrant with family back East, and I love them and where I am from, but shady practices are abound in China. So no xenophobia driven bias here, I have seen the damage done to my pup by Chinese treats, and these Platos treats are definitely a safer bet.<br /><br />The FDA statement regarding Chinese chicken treats can be found here:<br />[...]"
"My husky loves these treats.  I used to buy the chicken strips for her but they are not a USA made product so when I could we tried these snacks.  She absolutely loves them.  I break them up into smaller bits for training.  A winner.<br />Coming back for more chicken and going to give the duck ones a try--- she is, that is."
"I too am boycotting dog chews and treats not made in the US, so was nervous about ordering these.  Amazon needs to be very specific about this info in its descriptions, and not dance around the issue by leaving it out.  Country of origin should not be ""optional"" in terms of the descriptive information provided!<br /><br />That being said, these are a huge hit with our big guys.  They are a crunchy bisquit - not jerky - about 1 1/2"" long by maybe 3/4"" wide, but the first ingredient is organic chicken (package specifies ""over 90% organic chicken""), followed by organic brown rice; the product is certified USDA Organic.  [I am of the camp that ""organic"" means anything containing a carbon atom, and that aspect is not a big selling point for ME, but may be desirable info for some.]  They are not inexpensive, but for a product made in the US AND mostly chicken, I think it's in line with other pet treats, or less.  I use them in combination with other, more grain-containing treats, since TOO much protein can put a lot of strain on the kidneys, especially in older dogs.<br /><br />Bottom line - great product...this doggy Mom approves!"
"My dog absolutely loves these treats!  Size of the treat is great for my dog.  He weighs 35 pounds.  I highly recommend this treat, very few ingredients and most importantly they are made in the U.S.A."
I have an English Bulldog puppy and my Brussels Griffen dog both go crazy over these treats. With English Bulldog you have to watch what you feed them because they get gas :) so easy and I don't find him to be gassy from these treats! Love Plato treats!
"I have the pickiest dog when it comes to treats and non-human food and he absolutely loves these treats. They are great for a reward system or just having something to snack on in-between meals.<br />These treats are the best that I have found and they are worth every penny. I no longer waste my money on treats that have tons of chemicals or non-food parts.... These are Organic and honestly, I feel better as a parent when I give the treats to my fur kid.<br />These are a must buy if you want a healthy treat for your pet."
My dogs love this treat. Great price for a 16-qunce bag. The product is made of organic chicken. My dogs seem to have more energy after I changed to this brand.
"Sad that this company would not not take 10 sec. too look at the merchandise. The treats were green with moldy. I got so sick when I opened. Won't buy again, and have already found  substitute at Petsmart."
"My little chihuahua, Snoopy, absolutely loves these treats. His excitement level is over the top when he knows he is about to get a plato chicken treat. If snoop had his way he would eat these treats for his meals."
"Plato Chicken Treats are a favorite with my three dogs.<br />Each dog has their individual likes and dislikes; this treat is<br />loved by all three!<br />I have bought 5 bags so far and will buy more.<br />The treat is not super dry either.  I have an 11 year old Lab,<br />9 year old Chinese Crested, and a 3 year old Chinese Crested;<br />all three dogs are able to chew/bite the treat with no problem.<br />The treat is also easily broken in half...to share...awww..."
My Rottie and my Lab mix love these treats and they smell like real chicken.  I also give them other treats by Plato and they wolf them down.  Made in USA which is a big plus!
"Good, natural, USA made product. My Golden Retrievers love them. Price is right if you take advantage of the free supersaver shipping. A little high in fat content, 30%, but they are not big pieces, so it shouldn't be a problem if you give only once or twice a day. If you have a small dog, they are easily breakable into smaller bitesize pieces. I recommend this product."
"With the big scare out there about the chicken from China causing health issues in pets, I was on the hunt for something healthy, that my Furkids would love. They LOVE these...Thank you for a GREAT product..  :)"
My dogs love these and its great to finally find something made in the USA and not in China. You get a whole pound for what you pay for a tiny 3-6 oz bag in the store for a comparable item. I've bought two bags already and will be back for more.
"Normally, these treats are moist & chewy, but these are dry, hard, and stale.  These are the only type of treat my golden can eat because he has allergies. I guess we'll have to return to purchasing them locally."
"Got a bag of these for my Old English Sheepdog at a local ""Pet Health Food"" store. Nice enough store but a bit too ""New Age, Alternative Health, BS"" with prices to match.<br /><br />OTOH, the treats are great and he loves them so I was glad to find them much cheaper and Amazon Prime as well. I have ordered a couple more bags."
I have purchased these (more than 8) from Amazon (directly and from their merchants) in the past and it has been the best treat for my German Shepherd.  The size is perfect for a large dog. It is organic and only get them when the price is right.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J8H1E0"">Plato Organic Chicken Strips Smart Dog Treats</a>  Ordered these on Friday 6-3 and they arrived in my mailbox on 6-6.  Unbelievable!!  My little dog has seizures so I am very careful about what I feed her both food and treats.  She loved these and I am hoping no negative reactions.  I can't imagine that happening with the ingredients listed."
"At first, my dog (a 10lb Maltese-ish mutt) didn't seem to interested in these.  I've since decided it was because before these I was essentially handing him fully artificial crap.  I think it just took him a week or two to get used to the good stuff.<br /><br />Now, he sprints to his kennel whenever he hears me opening the bag!!<br /><br />Just ordered my second bag.  I do wish the other flavors came in individual packages, though.  It feels terrible to me to pay $50 on dog treats even if it is a bulk buy.  But that's certainly not a knock on the product!"
"This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons. They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats. These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be ""organic"" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them. I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money."
"I was searching for USA-made chicken jerky for my two chows and the Plato line came up. My goof not to realize these 'strips' are baked cookies, not dried chicken meat strips, and the dogs have made it very clear -- they definitely prefer real jerky. They don't seem to like the (sort of dry-fudgy) texture of these treats, but will 'accept' the chicken and the salmon, while simply rejecting the duck version. Broken up as training bits for the puppy these will probably be usable, which is good since they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Later I found Bellyrubs brand chicken jerky (at about half the price of Plato) at a feed store, and I am back in the dogs' good graces."
This is a good product. Our dogs love it. It has become a staple in our household. I recommend buying it.
My morkie is soooo fussy - he hates everything ever since he got a combo booster rabies/distemper shot!!!  He loves these.  They smell good to me even.  They seem to be top quality.  If Rexie likes them they must be OK.
"I bought these two months ago in a relentless search of made in the USA chicken jerky treats.  They are not jerky, but two inch formed pieces.  Also in the two months since I purchased them the price has increased 30%.  I feel that consumers looking for jerky that is made in the USA are being taken advantage of.  Also, my dogs agree, this is not jerky.  I love organic, but I will keep looking."
"My dog loved these, and he's picky as can be about his treats. I would break them in two or three pieces and give him one every time he did his business or during training. You could tell he liked them because he'd ring the bell to go outside just so he could take a fake leak and come in for another treat."
"Great product, great price and what's most important, great service.  Second order with this company and getting ready to use again. Highly recommend."
"I first tried these when I saw they are USA made.  My two Shih Tzu LOVE these.  It's one of the few treats I have tried they never get tired of.  It's also reassuring to know they are full of good ingredients. They are smaller in size and there are a lot in the bag, so they last a lot long time and they are reasonably priced. Great product!"
"My dog loves dried chicken jerky treats, but almost all are from China which concerns me.  Trying to find a safer alternative, I stumbled on these.  If you're looking for whole chicken breasts which have been dehydrated, these aren't the same.  They are pieces & parts molded together and almost look like cardboard.  My dog likes them, but they don't seem like anything special to me.  They do say organic, so hopefully are safer, but I'm not really impressed."
"OMG These smell sooooo good that I wanted to eat it myself! That's saying a lot, I usually hate the smell of Brownie's treats. Brownie loves it so much, he didn't want to follow me outside because he was still trying to find crumbs! LOL  They're also very healthy and cheap. These are way better than other expensive brands because they smell better, taste better and cost less.  This is bang for your buck. love it, love it, love it!"
"Firstly, these are a really great price compared to the Milo's Kitchen treats we normally buy. The only problem is our Pomeranian is pretty underwhelmed by them. When he gets his regular treats he is really excited and does his little ""doggy dance"". When I first gave him one the Plato treats he ignored it and our cat tried to eat it, I broke it up into pieces so kitty did get to eat it. The next day I left two on the floor and withheld his usual Milo's Kitchen Chicken Grillers. After awhile he finally ate both of them! So he will eat them but isn't too excited about them."
"I have two fussy dogs (Yorkshire Terrier/Poodle mixes), who reject any kind of hard biscuit after trying them for a few times. I've lost count of the number of bags and boxes of biscuits I've tried and then sent to my sister's dog, who'll eat anything.<br /><br />The Plato Organic Chicken biscuits are the only exception for my girls. When I offer them, they grab them and run to their favorite spot to crunch them right up. A little pricey, but worth it. I've finally given up trying anything else."
"We are always looking for a special and nutritious treat for our Boy.  We have tried various chicken jerky products but upon closer look, we note they are sourced from China. We tried these because they are organic and made in the US, and they are a hit.<br />These treats are hard and a bit difficult to break up, but they are our Scottie's favorite treats, and one of the only ones that elicit an automatic ""sit""!<br />This is a good product and very reasonably priced."
I had been looking for a reasonably priced dog treat that was mad in the U.S.A. because I read read to many stories of animals getting sick and dying from eating treats made in China.  I stumbled across these about a year ago on amazon and decided to give them a try.  My dog loves all the flavors that Plato offers and I love them because they are good for him and are produced right here in the U.S.  The price is very good compared to some other made in the U.S. treats I had tried before these.  I highly recommend these for your four legged family members!
"Our little Mini Schnauzer is very picky about her food.  These treats got a paws up!  There are like little baked cookies and must taste great, although I have not tried them.  Organic and made in the USA!"
I put 2 of these in a large Kong Extreme and it kept my 8 month old German Shepherd busy for hours. Life saver! Seriously.
These treats are my 18 month old Boston Terrier's favorite treat by far. We give him only natural treats with no wheat or tons of added fillers. He knows when we have some of these in the house and isn't happy if we give him something else.
"I used to feed my dogs the ""made in China"" chicken fillets and they all loved them but the more info I gathered about them the more I questioned feeding them to my dogs.  I switched to beef jerky but with 2 large dogs and 2 small dogs that became very pricy.  I found these by doing a search on Amazon for chichen treats made in the USA with free shipping.  All four of the dogs love them and I feel much better about feeding these to them and while they are not cheap they are a lot cheaper than beef jerky."
"This is the favorite treat of my miniature australian shepherd. I am unaware of similar treats that are currently produced by other manufacturers. I order the Plato treats online. They are unavailable in all of the ""big box"" pet stores in my area."
"My everlasting quest to find cheap and healthy dog treats has eventually lead me to this brand.  I have yet to find any healthy treats cheaper than this when looking at a cost/ounce comparison.  It's made in the USA, which is a necessity.  I refuse to buy any dog treats from China, and so should you.  I used to buy the Waggin Train brand until I researched it.  Please research your dog treats!<br /><br />I would say these fall somewhere between a hard and soft treat.  They are not chewy, but will not crumble when you break them.  I usually break them in half so the bag lasts longer.  My Lab likes them, but I wouldn't say they are his favorite.  He will sometimes turn these down if he has a more desirable toy in his mouth.  This is the only reason I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5.  I do plan to try the other flavors to see if he likes them better."
Dogs love this treat.  They are very easy to chew no matter how old the dog is.  This treat should come in a chicken strip size.  The treats are reasonably priced and I will continue to buy them as long as the price stays reasonable.
"Dogs love it. It smells like chicken. I have bought the slamon and duck so far and my dogs enjoyed every one of them. I will be buying these treats forever, price is right and is currently the local retailer (online) to purchase it too. Nothing has compared to this without any complications."
"I ordered this for my mom's Chihuahua as an ongoing present. I truly believe that dogs shouldn't be eating grains (corn is a grain too, folks!) - this is why our animals are getting obese just like their owners! This comes with organic chicken meat, no grains, and still fills that desire for the ""convenience of modern convenience."""
"This is a great product with healthy ingredients for dogs.  No soy, wheat or glycerin that is known to cause problems for dogs.<br />Easy to chew for senior dogs or dogs with problem teeth."
"I have been trying to keep my dogs on products made in the USA (who would have thought that would be so hard).  Having three dogs it is hard to find someting they all like and I was a little apprehensive about these being ""cookies"" vs ""jerky"".  However, the treats are soft and chewy and all my dogs love them. I am happy because they are made in the USA and my dogs are happy so these are definitely a keeper."
"My dogs love these treats. More importantly to me, I can feel good about feeding them these treats.  With all the questionable and even toxic ingredients going into many of our pet foods, it is nice to know that I can get a safe product for my dogs. Chicken and Beef meats have a lot of antibiotics and other undesirable stuff.  I always look for organic chicken and beef products. My dogs are are family - I want them to have healthy lives."
"This item is made in the USA, uses free range organic chicken, no crazy fillers or by-products. My dogs go crazy over these. A must have for doggie bedtime ritual at our house. Great shipping!!!"
Both my dogs love these healthy dog treats. I have been buying these for several years now. Wish they made a beef treat too!
"I have two Jack Russell Terriers - properly spoiled and very picky.  I will not give them any food or treats not made in the United States and I also try to avoid giving them things containing grains.  The Plato Organic Chicken treats met my criteria for a healthy, safe USA-made treat and BOTH of my dogs LOVE them.  I would HIGHLY reccommend these!"
These are hopefully better treats than the ones with artificial color added.. The dogs all do great tricks to get them...:)) And made in the USA is a BIG plus for me...
"Dogs love them.  Even though they are kind of expensive, they don't have a bunch of fillers."
"I liked the price of the product and my dog Boo surley loves it! I think that the cost of the shipping and handling were way too high, quite a lot more than I paid for the product, which did not make it as good a value as I was hopping. According to the alert I recieved tellling me of the price!I would diffinetly order it again if the price and shipping cost were fair. As I said earlier my dog Boo really loves his chicken treats especially Jerky, but he was real keen on the Plato treats as well!"
"A very strange treat.. dogs did not like any of the varieties we tried and I ordered three different varieties.<br />Not a 'strip' but a baked 'cookie' that was really very hard and more of a chunk of something backed, not meat looking or smelling.<br />Just really weird and I would never buy them again! save your money and buy the Chicken Jerky treats at WalGreens that are a bone fide strip of chicken and dogs love them! these are chunks of mystery material and not at all appetizing."
"Wellness is a food we like for our dogs both because of what's in it and what's not in it. Why does it cost a little more than some other foods? Think about what's not in it. No meat-by-products. No wheat. No corn. No white rice. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br /><br />Our bichon had been having major problems with itching and skin allergies. Our vet suggested we put her on a bland diet and gradually introduce foods to determine the cause or causes or her discomfort. One day an employee at a local pet store suggested we try Wellness with whitefish and sweet potato. I wasn't sure about feeding fish to our dogs but gave it a try.<br /><br />The switch to this Wellness formula was a great success. Evie loves the flavor of this recipe and eats it eagerly. While on the Wellness diet her itching and scratching decreased tremendously. If you think your dog may have food allergies that trigger itching and excessivve scratching, give this Wellness recipe a try."
I like the idea this dog food is holistic with limited ingredients. This dog food is human grade. I picked this Wellness food to help my dogs with allergies. Their fur and skin look great with no dry itchy skin. No tummy problems either.
my niece introduced me to this dip mix a few years back. Unfortunately I could not find this mix in my home state so I was happy to find it on amazon . I top it off with peach salsa and it it a hugh hit at partys. enjoy!
"I adore Rodelle Vanilla Beans.  They are the plumpest beans I have ever seen, and give an incredible heady flavour. These beans yield a huge amount when scraped because they are so plump.  Your desserts will definitely show that you used real vanilla beans!  Then the scraped pods can then be used for making wonderful vanilla sugar!"
"I highly recommend this product. I am dairy nut and gluten free so it is very hard to find anything resembling regular milk which I really miss. My kids also love this. Amazon, if you read this, please consider putting this on your subscription. I would subscribe to all 3 flavors!"
This is a delicious more healthy way of drinking a chocolate drink. I have shared it with my aunt and sister in law.
"My son has some allergy issues so I am trying to get him off dairy.  This chocolate milk is amazing, and when I need a choco fix I go right for this box as well!  I would buy it on subscription."
"CP is right! So Delicious 6.5 oz is TOTALLY worth being a Subscribe & Save product! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!"
"Great for most people that are trying to control blood glucose impact of their foods by controlling digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />This stuff tastes the same as regular pasta.  Just be sure to read the label on your pasta sauce so you don't inadvertently take in a lot of sugars via the sauce, or better yet, make your own.<br /><br />A few things to be aware of that I have discovered:<br /><br />Don't overcook it!<br /><br />Don't put cooked pasta in the sauce and heat it - that is, do NOT pour the sauce into the pasta and mix it up in the pan and heat it!  Cook and drain the pasta firs according ot the directions ont he box, THEN plate the bare pasta first (possibly tossing it lightly in olive oil) and only then pour the sauce and other toppngs on and serve immediately.<br /><br />Again: Don't put the sauce, meat and cheese on the pasta until you actually plate it and serve it.<br /><br />I've found if you ""re-cook"" Dreamfields ""angel hair"" pasta in normal (acidic) tomato based pasta sauces that it does hit my blood sugar a lot harder than if they are put together at the last minute.  Same goes for overcooking it (aside from the fact that any pasta that's overcooked turns to mush).  My guess is the extra heat or acidity causes the ""sequestered"" carbs to break out and become available for digestion.<br /><br />All in all, this stuff in incredible, and tastes no different than most other boxed pastas, and doesn't cause the blood sugar spikes and weight gain that the normal pastas do.  I bought a case of it, and have some of the other types of Dreamfields as well."
"Here at last is a low-carb pasta so good that you will be able to enjoy your favorite dishes whenever you wish.  [My concern is low carb eating to lose weight;  I can't address the blood sugar situation.]<br />But a major bane of a low-carb diet has been the necessary elimination of pasta.  And we all know that whole wheat pastas just aren't the same.  Well, Dreamfields is just the same.  Welcome back, quick, easy, delicious pasta meals.  A jar of that wonderful Costco White Linen Collection Marinara Sauce, 2 carbs per 1/2 cup, and a quarter cup [cooked] of Dreamfields pasta, and: Bob's your uncle! You have a lovely dinner, with a simple salad, and the next day your weight will not be affected negatively [don't eat any cake, though!].<br />Happy days are here again!"
"We love this pasta.  We don't have any blood sugar problems, but like to limit our carb intake.  Dreamfields is great tasting pasta, but you don't have to pay a fortune for it.  We have an imported pasta we like better, but it's $8-$9 for 12 oz. at a gourmet shoppe.  We like this ALMOST as much, it's low carb and MUCH less expensive.  I can heartily recommend you try it."
"This product tastes great and, I'm sure, is the great white hope for MANY Type II diabetics...just not me and probably others like me.  I am quite insulin resistant and a couple of hours after my meal of Dreamfields my blood sugar was 149.......4 hours later it was 229 with NO additional food of any kind.  I found out later that this is a known issue with this pasta with some insulin resistant diabetics.  I feel that the Amazon page for this product should say that as should Dreamfield's website.  Just thought someone should warn people. (But it tastes great)"
"I tried the Argan oil after watching a documentary on TV. I originally ordered it 1) by curiosity (I wanted to see what the hype was about) and 2) because of it's alleged health properties.<br />I was amazed by the taste. I will never revert back to olive oil, EVER! The  antioxidant virtues are really an added bonus for me, my salads have become amazing and very special. I love the nutty flavor!<br />I also ordered the raw version for my skin and hair, and its equally as amazing. My skin has recovered its elasticity and radiance."
This is the best example of customer service I have ever seen.  My bottle of oil got broken in transit.  No ones real fault.  The immedietely sent me a new bottle and were so kind about it I was simply amazzed.
"I traveled to Morocco a couple of years ago and experienced Argan oil for the first time.  It was wonderful.  I put it on broccoli, rice, bread, salad, the list goes on.  I love the taste and the health benefits.  Very, very special."
"I love this oil, I have lost over a hundred pounds since I started using it about a year ago and have not changed any other diet or exercise  I use it on my skin and hair it is amazing what it does it gets rid of all wrinkles and it makes hair beautiful, full and long in no time. I thought it would just be greasy and the same as all other oils but it is not. It is like a health and beauty miracle in a bottle like the fountain of youth."
"When ordering this product I was led to believe it shipped free. I was billed<br />almost $ 5 .! 2ndly, 2 items are pictured whereas I received only one. Not<br />withstanding the health properties of this oil, I believe it is much overpriced.<br />I suggest buying somewhere else."
"I usually don't write these but I had to for this item. I bought this as a present for my nieces. It arrived today and my sister sent me pictures of it and what was inside. I was very disappointed when upon seeing the pictures I saw that everything that was detailed on the item page as being included was not.<br /><br />Item was not as described and I contacted Amazon and the rep ""Taniya"" initially just gave me her opinion on the matter instead of a real answer to my question. I asked if I had to call the company directly to just have the missing items sent. At no point did I ask for a replacement or a refund, just wanted the missing advertised items. After I expressed my dissatisfaction of her reply (her opinion) to my question a refund was offered only if I placed the order again. This did not resolve my problem at all. I am very disappointed at Art of Appreciation Gourmet Gift Baskets and Amazon customer support.<br /><br />So don't waste your money on this item. You can easily buy all this yourself for $15 or less. Lesson learned."
"I typically like to make my own soups, but when I want bean with bacon soup, I buy Campbell's Bean with Bacon. I can't seem to replicate the flavor of this, and prefer it to my own version of bean with bacon soup. I've been enjoying this Campbell's flavor since I was about 12 years old when I first had it, and it's still one of my favorites.<br /><br />This comfort-food-feeling soup has a hearty flavor and density that keeps me full for hours. In the thick broth, there are little soft bits of bacon, as well as tiny pieces of (soft) carrots. The main attraction of this soup, the beans, are plentiful, have a great flavor and are nice and soft. Nutrition fact wise, the total fat per serving is only 3 grams of fat, calories per serving 160 grams, protein: 8 grams and 5 mg of cholesterol.<br /><br />Not only for the great flavor and protein, but also because this is a relatively healthy soup, I recommend this to anyone that needs food every now and then :)<br /><br />As a side note, it's a nice little bonus that each Campbell's soup can has a 5 points ""Labels For Education"" label which is worth actual money (5 points = 5 cents) to participating schools."
I highly recommend both the Blood Orange spread and the seller. The spread is very flavorful and goes well with so many different foods.
"After a long flight, I arrived in Moorea, tired and thirsty.  Weather was very warm and humid.  At the lobby of this 5-star hotel where I was staying, a smiling hotel employee at the front desk handed me a beverage.  One sip of this cold, refreshing, drink and I just had to ask what it was.  It tasted like freshly squeezed lemonade, without the tartness or after-taste of sweetener. She then left and came back with this bottle of Teisseire Lime from France, a product which I was not familiar with.  I insisted on buying an unopened bottle to bring back home.  Upon returning to the USA, I immediately hunted for this product and found it on Amazon.  I promptly order several bottles in Lime, Strawberry, and Grapefruit flavors.  All were delicious, and I will definitely continue buying them."
"This shipment was not as expected.  Yes, there were 24 k-cups. However, only 3 were flavored!  This was advertised as ""24 ct flavored coffee sampler"".  Additionally, 5 of the k-cups were decaf although a 24 count decaf sampler was a different item order choice.  Very disappointed.  Will not order this again.  Certainly not up to Amazon standards."
"I ordered this for a christmas gift for my mother, and was so upset when I recieved the box. I can appreciate the ""eco-friendly"" packaging (stapled shut paper bag), but it was completly unsuitable for a present; I ABSOLUTLY would not have ordered this if I had known. I was so disapointed with the variety also- many of the same one, and gross flavors. It's like somebody picked out all the ones they liked and shipped off the rejects. I dont even want to waste any more money shipping this back. Buyer beware."
"""We repackage k-cups into a new bag. We use a recyclable and compostable bag that is eco-friendly.""  So how would they ""gift wrap"" the crumpled and stapled brown paper bag in which these arrived?  I bought these as a gift, expecting a box or company gift bag as the eco friendly container. Mediocre collection of coffees that could have found while dumpster diving.  That's what the presentation leads one to imagine.  Will not be giving as a gift and probably won't use them.  Go to a local market instead!"
Despite all the negative reviews I took my gamble ordering this variety sampler n I'm very happy with the variety I received. All flavored coffees; a few repeats but I'll still give it 5 stars bc of 24 I get to try 11 different coffees. In my 24 pack I received:<br />5 green mountain hazelnut<br />4 gm french vanilla<br />3 gm pumpkin spice<br />3 gloria jeans butter toffee<br />2 gj french vanilla supreme<br />2 gm caramel vanilla cream<br />1 gm wild mountain blueberry<br />1 gm southern pecan<br />1 gm spicy eggnog<br />1 donut house chocolate glazed donut<br />1 dh cinnamon roll
"Six were Green Mtn breakfast blend decaf(ugh,obviously not what I consider 'flavored'), 3 Green Mtn Colombian Fair trade Select (not flavored), 3 Donut house cafe blend (flavored? not specified), 3 Green Mtn Hazelnut (yay), 3 Green Mtn pumpkin spice, 3 Green Mtn Gingerbread and 3 Newman's Own extra bold Melange. I don't regret trying these, but it's very unlikely I would buy again because of the unflavored coffees they included and the fact that 6 of those unflavored were decaf. Arrived safely, loose in packing box."
"I ordered this for my husband as he wanted to add a bit of variety to his morning coffee experience.  We received a nice variety and although the packaging wasn't the best, it was<br />as described by other reviewers. Overall we were both happy and I would order it again.  If you plan on giving it as a gift--just remove the cups and put it in another package. It isn't that big of a deal LOLOL"
"The selection I received was perfect, and I my husband was thrilled with his gift! I would definitely do business with this vendor again!"
Sometimes you just want a little variety in your morning coffee!! This is an excellent way to try different flavors!!  I was quite impressed with the flavors I hadn't known were available!
I am very pleased with my order. I hardly had any doubles. A very nice variety that I will purchase again.
"Ok, so it is a little strange that these literally come in a brown paper bag. But, I don't care. I got an awesome assortment of coffees to try. I'm excited to try each and everyone. No ""filler"" flavors like I expected. I will certainly be buying again. And if you are buying a Kurig for someone for Christmas, I Highly recommend you purchase this for them as well!! Where is the 6 stars button?"
"I bought this sample pack of K-cups to go along with the coffee maker I bought my sister for Christmas.  I received a great variety of flavors, a few duplicates, but overall a very nice selection.  I saw some of the other reviews complained they only received a couple of different flavors.  I can not say the same.  There were at least a dozen different flavors in the box.<br /><br />The packaging isn't so great.  The cups just come loose in the brown box they are shipped in.  Not a big deal if you are buying them for your own use, however I will have to find a small box to gift these in.  But the price was right and they arrived in 3 days - overall I am pleased."
"I am VERY pleased with the variety provided! I plan on purchasing this again just so I can see what other flavors I might get.  What a great idea this is!  Plus, if you have a friend or relative with a Keurig, you can trade flavors...or at least unload the ones you don't like.  I received a nice vatiety and only doubles on less than half.  Nothing was expired and everything has plenty of time left until expiration.  I highly recommend this!!"
Great asst of good quality coffees!Each one is a new experience and enjoyable in it's own right. I highly recommend and will buy again in the future
"Just recieved my k cups and thrilled with the assortmet.  i got mostly two of some flavors, and three of one kind, But extremely happy with what I got!  i definately will be ordering again and again!  I highly recommend this seller and assortment. There were so many flavors! Pumkin spice, mudslide, butter toffee,  hazelnut, french vanilla, mountain blueberry,  just to name a few!"
"Same Price at Kroger, but you get the benefit of receiving 10 cents off per gallon for gas.  Just be sure to check around...changes all the time."
I ordered this Coffee Sampler as well as several other things on Amazon and the coffee was the first to arrive. Thanks!
"I confess I was worried I'd be getting a bunch of only a few flavors but to my surprise, I got all different ones...really good ones too!  I can't wait to try out each and every one of them.  I'll be back for more!"
"This variety kcup pack was pretty good. My fav out of them was the Green Mountain brand. I'm not really a chocolate coffee lover, but I tried them all. I've noticed since I got a Kuerig machine for my birthday I have been practically using it almost every day taking my coffee to work. Pump the breaks, I needed to slow down, I started getting the caffeine headaches. So now I'm down to maybe taking the coffee in twice a week and everything has been fine. I would order again and maybe next time some decaf. Good variety."
My husband and I enjoyed these very flavorful coffee's very much and would highly recommend them. We were able to determine some that we liked  better than others and will order just those flavors although they were all good.
I loved this product since I like to have a variety of flavored coffees at any one time and buying individual packages can be expensive.
"I eagerly opened my package, expecting to see a delightful assortment of flavors. I took them out of the bag one by one. Hazelnut, hazelnut, hazelnut, french vanilla, hazelnut, french vanilla... All but 2 were either hazelnut or french vanilla. I do not even really like hazelnut! This was not what I hoped for at all."
"I guess I was also disappointed in the assortment.  The info suggests you get 34 different coffees, so that you don't have to ""buy 34 different boxes.""  But as others reported, I got repeats in the assortment, as many as 4 of the exact same product.  Furthermore, I received two CIDER products, which are not coffee.  I don't want cider, I want coffee.  And thanks for the iced coffee sample, which I also don't drink.  Lastly, the k-cups are packaged in a brown paper bag which is stapled shut.  I'm guessing that doesn't even meet food packaging codes; there's no product info, ingredient info or nutrition info."
"A lot of people are complaining about the fact that these come in a brown bag. They are in a brown bag, INSIDE of an amazon box. So it's not as if they are in danger of being crushed in the mail. I got a couple of teas mixed in, which is fine with me. I got some great choices. It seems a bit random,  but that is ok with me because I am a new user and wanted to try lots of choices and see what I really liked.<br /><br />So far I really love the Pumpkin Spice, the Cinnamon Roll and Supreme Vanilla. I would order again."
"It seems like they have tried to improve the selection of coffees since the reviews that I read. These are the coffees that I received and the quantity of each flavor.<br /><br />Green Mountain - Wild Mountain Blueberry (4), Hazelnut Noisette (6), French Vanilla (6), Caramel Vanilla Cream (6), Mocha Nut Fudge (3), Gingerbread (2), Golden French Toast (2), Pumpkin Spice (1)<br /><br />Donut House - Chocolate Glazed Donut (2)<br /><br />Gloria Jeans - Butter Toffee (1), Hazelnut (1)<br /><br />Timothy's - Kahlua (1)<br /><br />I didn't get some of the flavors that I would have liked to have tried from the list but maybe I'll get them the next time I order. I will probably order again when these are gone. :)"
"This is basically an assorted box of crap they couldn't sell whole boxes of. Pumkpin spice, spicy eggnog, wild mountain blueberry... only a few real coffee flavors. I thought it would be a good way to try out new flavors of coffee. I was wrong."
"I bought this variety pack to go with the coffee maker I purchased as a gift.  The variety I received was decent, but I was totally unimpressed when I opened the shipping box and found that the coffee assortment was packaged in an unlabeled plain, brown paper bag.  I thought the assortment would at least come in a labeled box of some sort, but the samples were literally stuffed in a bag with the top bunched up like a brown bag lunch.  It literally looked like someone just tossed 24 random coffees in a bag and threw it in a shipping box.  Not the best for gift-giving.  I thought that was pretty tacky, especially for the price."
"By the letter of the description, the order was accurate--I got 11 ""different"" types of coffee. That is, if you believe that regular Donut House, Folgers Lively Columbian, regular Caribou Blend, Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend are different types of coffee. They're not. (I also got five other cups in four actual varieties: pumpkin spice, gingberbread, french toast and eggnog.) Furthermore, they all came shipped loose in a box. Again, no special packaging was promised, but I was planning this as a gift, and it's not really gift-appropriate.<br /><br />All in all, I have no grounds to stand on in asking for a refund, but this isn't what I was expecting."
"I ordered the coffee samplers for a christmas gift. I was very excited that received the order really quick. I was expecting it to be in real packaging. Opened the box and found a crumpled up brown bag, hole on the backside with the k-cups tossed in and stapled shut. There's no way I'm going to give this as a gift. There was a good variety if you are buying for personal use, but the packaging dies not cut it. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OAZ36I"">24 Count K-cup Flavored Coffee Sampler</a> Huge disappointment!"
"This is the third time I've ordered the flavored sampler, and in the 24 K-Cups, about 10 of them are hot chocolate!  When you're ordering for your office, and expect a coffee sampler but get a majority of hot chocolate, it's very disappointing!  I guess there's no way to confirm what flavors they decide to throw in your box."
"I wanted to try different flavors of coffee, and 3/4 of the package was hot chocolate.  I won't order this again."
"I have ordered this exact product in the past and have always received a wide variety of flavors and brands of k-cups.  This shipment was beyond poor in its selection, of the 34 kcups 16 of them were the same flavor and all 34 were the same brand.  Not impressed."
"This product not only came damaged, but also more than half of the contents were decaf.  That should have been stated in the description.  Very disappointing!!!"
"Flavored coffee sampler is how this product is described.  What I received were 12 flavored coffee's and then an assortment of capuccino,tea and cider.  To be fair I ordered this item one more time and the exact same thing happened.  I also contacted customer service and they sent me out another 24 pack and once again it was the same thing.  They told me they would pull the item from the listing and get it straightened out one way or the other.  I will be looking to see if it is still listed.  I love the idea of trying new flavors but not at the expense of not getting all coffee."
"I received the K-cup sampler and immediately sorted through the flavors upon its arrival.  The  selections should have been titled ""Vanilla Assortment,"" since the majority of cups in the box were variations of that flavor.  There was nothing from Celestial Seasonings, but I enjoyed the coffees I did receive.  One other note - there was no packing slip with the order, so if I was not satisfied, I'm not sure how I would have filed a complaint."
"When you think of Sampler Pack you think maybe two or three of the same k-cups, right? eh, eh? You will NOT get that from this box.<br /><br />Here is what I got:<br /><br />3 Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />1 Hazlenut Decaf<br />6 Butter Toffee<br />5 Mudslide<br />3 Southern Pecan<br />1 Hazlenut Noisette<br />4 French Vanilla<br />5 French Vanilla Supreme<br />1 Caramel Vanilla Creme<br />4 Kahlua<br />1 Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Also, the packaging was TERRIBLE.  Some of my k-cups were damaged as they were just all thrown into a box with no kind of care to the condition or to the variety.<br /><br />It SUCKED.  Will not be trusting this Sampler Pack again."
"more than half of my ""sampler"" was the cappuccino mix, NOT flavored coffee. these cappuccino k-cups are full of artificial sweeteners and creamers neither of which i consume. Very disappointed, will not order from this company again"
These were all thrown into a brown lunch bag. They were not even all coffee. I had 6 hot chocolates and an apple cider. Mostly all one flavor not a variety. Big waste of money.
"Thrown into a bag, some were broken, selection was terrible.  Not even 50% were coffee!  Would never purchase again or recommend.  Shame on you!"
"The fist time that I bought a batch I was pleased because as a result of a review (I think) they were more careful with the selection.  The later purchase was not very good but still was not bad enough to make me give them a bad review and I decided to give them another try.  My las purchase was really, really bad.  They sent 7 Hazelnut DECAF (7 DECAF!!!! And of the same!!) and like 8 hot cocoa, so more than half the order was not coffe that I could use for my morning caffein rush.  I had never received more than 2 decaf and 2 of other (hot cocoa or tea). Do not buy, look for other seller, even if it's a little more expensive it will be a lot better purchase than this."
"I bought the 34 count. Maybe I caought the packaging department on an off day. I recieved 10 flavors in my package, which would be fine, but 4 of the flavors only had one sample. Several of the flavors were very common flavors and not that exciting. A majority of the box I received was Donut shop chocolate glazed (5), Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream (6), and of course Kahlua (8)... that is 19/34, so almost 2/3 of the package was 3 flavors.<br /><br />This sampler was not what I was hoping for and seemed to be a compilation of the flavors you see on the discount shelves at the store all the time. I could have bought a box of 18 Kahlua at big lots for $7. I would think that any sampler should limit themselves to know more that 4 of any given flavors."
"I ordered this flavored coffee sampler, and expected that I would receive flavored COFFEE.  However, half the k-cups were cappuchino or hot chocolate.  That is not flavored coffee.  I ordered this sampler once before and got lots of great coffees and only a few cappuchinos and a mocha something-or-other, which was fine.  But this just wasn't what I wanted - cappuchino and coffee are very different things."
Very disappointed to find 6 hot cocoa kcups and 4 flavored cappuccino............I ordered flavored coffee not hot chocolate!!  The coffee kcups I did get were variations of vanilla ;(
"I bought this sample pack believing I would receive 25 different flavored coffees.  Instead I received 15 flavored coffees, 4 hot chocolates, and 6 cappucinos.  After going back and looking at the product description, it did not state anywhere anything except flavored coffee.  The variety from the 15 flavored coffees is good and as expected, but the hot chocolate and cappucino will just go to waste now."
"I thought I was buying 24 flavored flavored coffee samplers. If I drank tea, it would have been alright, but I don't."
"I like to try a lot of different coffees with my Keurig and frequently buy random assortments like this one.  The k-cups came in a small box, just thrown in there, but they were packed fine in my opinion.  They box was the right size for the 34-count option I ordered and I even got 1 extra k-cup.  The assortment was ok.  I got commonly liked flavors, several were duplicates, and more than half the box was Green Mountain coffee.  I also got 6 decafs which I really don't drink, but I hold on to them for guests.  I generally prefer to get more of a variety of flavors and brands, but the flavors I received are ones I like, so I'm not really complaining.  Here's the breakdown of what I got.<br /><br />Green Mountain Coffee:<br />3 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />2 Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 French Vanilla<br />2 Mocha Nut Fudge<br />2 Southern Pecan<br />1 Wild Mountain Blueberry Fair Trade<br />2 Hazelnut (Decaf)<br />4 French Vanilla (Decaf)<br /><br />Gloria Jean's:<br />1 Hazelnut<br />1 Butter Toffee<br />2 French Vanilla Supreme<br />5 Mudslide<br /><br />Donut House:<br />1 Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />2 Kahlua"
"I really liked the variety that came. I get really tired of drinking the same flavors over and over and this was a really good way to try different brands and different flavors. Even if you get one that you don't like, oh well, it's only one K cup and you're not stuck with an entire box of a flavor that you don't like. I might never buy regular packs again, and just buy this variety pack. Fast shipping and good variety. I have no complaints!"
"Great selection of flavored coffees!  I received 2-3 of each flavor in the pack, except the Island Coconut.  I received about 5 of those, but I wasn't disappointed since it's a seasonal flavor (and delicious).  My personal favorite is the Cinnamon Roll.  Yum!  They were packaged in a sturdy cardboard box-- not a paper bag like so many other posters commented about.  This is a great way to try a bunch of different flavored coffees without having multiple boxes taking up space in your pantry or kitchen cupboard.  I will be ordering this again!"
"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product.  I was expecting an assortment of flavored COFFEE, but instead I only got 11 flavored coffee, one decaf, and the rest was hot chocolate and cappuccino.  I even searched through several products before I settled on this one because there was NOTHING about hot chocolate or cappuccino in the description. I will not buy from this seller again."
"The Flavored Coffee Samples were packaged in a paper bag which busted open and several of the coffee's had spilled all over my other products.  These products were the Monster High 1600 Draculaura Doll, and the Monster High Skull Shores Ghoulia Yelps Doll. These were birthday present's that I had to give with coffee and the coffee smell all over it.  Very dissatisfied with the packaging and also didn't get to experience some of the flavors of the coffee..I would have returned the package but like I said the doll was a present and no time to replace the gift. The coffee smell was very obvious, and I was embarrassed with this as a gift.  I wish I would have thought to take a picture!!! Very dissatisfied!!!!! I think the coffee should be replaced and will be reporting this to Amazon!!! READ other similar comments!!!!  DON""T buy from this Seller...."
"Boy am I disappointed! I was looking forward to trying some new flavors and I got pretty much all the flavors I have already tried! I really do NOT want 5 chocolate donut, 4 butter toffee, 4 kahlua and 3 French vanilla. The description mentions many different types of coffee k cups. Seems to me that you should be able to get one of each flavor. Terrible vendor. I should have listened to other reviews but was hoping that the company would take notice of the bad reviews and improve their service. Shame on you!"
"Received a great selection!!!!! 22 different flavors of coffee, only one decaf, and 2 different cider flavors. I'm excited to try them all!!!"
I was really pleased with the variety of flavors in this selection.  I could have done with fewer french vanilla but its ok.  I will be ordering it again!
This was a good selection of flavored K-Cup coffees & I recieved a free box of K-Cup hot cocoa with my purchase
"I ordered two 24-packs of the K-cup portion packs and got exactly what the description said: there were 24 k-cups in a brown paper bag (shipment came in a box, the box had 2 paper bags) with a variety of different flavors. The most repetition I found was 3 of the same flavor. Because it was a grab bag, you do risk getting those gross (or at least to my pallet) flavors of eggnog flavored coffee, but it's still worth getting if most you will get is 2-3 of that flavor. There are brands of coffee I know I will not purchase a full box of because of this grab bag (Grove Square.. hardly tastes like coffee. I need to add regular coffee brewing next to the keurig to dial down the creaminess of the orignial). All in all, money well spent."
I thought they made weak coffee almost all were one flavor not very diverse.  Just ended up giving them away at work
Arrived in perfect condition with all different flavored coffees.  I could not be happier.  I will buy again (and again!)
I love sampler packs and trying new kinds but with this half were not even coffee instead a lot of spiced cider and hot chocolate which we do NOT drink!! Very unhappy.<br />Its even more annoying than I first noticed 12 are grove square ciders or cocoas! 4 are grove square cappunccino  and only 6 are good coffees.  Grove Square for me is the worst its always too sweet and its cheap in the stores. This assortment is way overpriced and so not worth it And I only recieved 22 not 24
I was pleased with the assortment of coffee but received 2 hot cocoa and 5 cider cups which I did not want. Would have left 5 stars if there were 24 COFFEE cups as stated.
"I 2nd that they assortments were not great although i seemed to luck out more than other reviewers.  there were too many of the ""boring"" flavors like french vanilla (at least 3 each) and hazelnut (3 or 4 each).  i did get some good flavors that i've been wanting to try but the reason we purchase this is try out new flavors so having several of the same flavor (especially the common ones) is not the reason we buy this so whoever is organizing this - take a clue!<br /><br />and it was packaged sloppily.  thrown in a paper bag like an after-thought.  not done very classy!"
"Description states: ""This is a variety of flavored coffee . . .This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee.""  So I ordered two for 48 K-cups of ""flavored caffeinated coffee"" and received 9 ciders, a few cappuccinos, and a hot cocoa - about 30% of my order was not coffee!  Two cups were so damaged I threw them out as the top seal was broken.  Several others were ""dented."" Guess this is a lesson in you get what you pay for, as this was the most reasonable value pack offer, but I'm afraid to drink the product as they came in two paper bags packed in a cardboard box, which looks like someone put this together in their kitchen with scrap K-cups they've collected."
"Unlike some of the others who complained about a poor selection, my purchase featured a wide variety of attractive flavors. Unfortunately I will not be able to try them all because many are dented and crushed, causing some of them to come open in transit. Unfortunate and disappointing. Packaging them in a brown paper bag might not have been the best idea."
"I did receive 24 different cups none of which were damaged or expired.  However, despite the claim that ""this variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee,"" I received two Apple Ciders and two Hot Chocolates."
"The description clearly states, ""This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee."" but it was not 24 samples of coffee.  Several of the K-cups were ciders and there was a hot chocolate.  That would be fine if the seller disclosed that in the description but to say you're sending 24 COFFEE samples, then send something other than coffee is just plain deceitful."
"I bought 2 variety packs and the  flavors seem to be fairly decent and varied especially taking into consideration the low price. My only problem and the reason for knocking off 2 stars is the inclusion of 4 cider K-cups in each package. 1/6 of the order consisted of non coffee products and the description specifically states ""This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee"".<br /><br />I purchased this for $14.25 and noticed only 3 days after ordering, the price had increased to $17.18. I know it's only a few dollars, but as the price increases I find it difficult to justify buying this product again. Especially since the package is NOT exclusively coffee as the description states."
"I admit that I was in a hurry and didn't read the description or the reviews before I made my purchase. I have no issues with the assortment if coffees, but I got 6 ciders which I was not expecting and I don't drink. I went back and read the description and it said 24 coffees so I don't think that's an accurate description."
Have only tried about 3 of the flavored coffees thus far and not impressed at all...  The coffees are weak and lack the flavor that they should have such as the Cinnamon Roll coffee - coffee was very weak and cinnamon roll flavor non-existent. Will continue to try more but not hopeful at the moment...
This was not only a good deal but also a great variety of coffee flavors.  You get about 8 or 9 different flavors with anywhere from 3 to 5 of each.  The ones we've tried are great and the others sound tasty too.
"I like the variety, it's packaged well, and delivered promptly.  It never bothered me when it was packed in a paper bag, but for those that may have reservations it's now packed in a box and the shipping box is carefully insulated against bumps and bruises.  I have re-ordered this item 5 times and couldn't be happier."
"Though I got a few doubles of different kinds of vanilla, this was such a great variety of coffee. Fortunately, I love vanilla, so no biggie. I didn't get any tea in this one. Shipping was quick and arrived loose in the box which wasn't an issue. Will be ordering from here again, kudos!!"
"The description said it would be a random sample of assorted K-cup flavors.  When I unpacked it, I was impressed with the variety.  The rest of the family (there are four coffee drinkers in the house) is acting like it's Christmas morning.  Lot's of oohs and aah s over the aroma and flavor of the different blends.<br /><br />We will definitely be ordering this again and probably very soon."
I have ordered this assortment in the past and have always been pleased with the K Cups delivered.  I received my 24 count and not one duplicate flavor - each one an original.  I will order this assortment again.
"I wanted to get some K-cups for my new Keurig, but since I am new to the K-cup world I did not know what I wanted to buy. This sampler has many delicious flavors that I definitely enjoyed drinking, including some vanilla, caramel, and cappucino K-cups. I cannot decide which I like best so I may order this again! I recommend to anyone who wants to try a wide range of good coffee flavors."
"Absolutely love the different flavors of coffee that were in this bundle; very delicious and at a decent price. I honestly was a little surprised that it came in such a big box only for the K-cups to be in a brown bag and not in their own box like you buy at the store. Other than that small quirk, I probably will buy my K-cups from here again but not after looking at other sellers."
"I received my coffee assortment yesterday.  Included in my brown paper grab bag were the following items:<br /><br />4 Wolfgang Punk:<br />Vanilla Francaise<br />Creme Caramel<br />Jamaica Me Crazy<br />Hawaiian Hazelnut<br /><br />10 Green Mountain Coffee:<br />Southern Pecan<br />Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />Hazelnut Noisette<br />Golden French Toast--Limited Edition<br />French Vanilla<br />2 French Vanilla Decaf<br />Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />Island Coconut--Limited Edition<br />French Vanilla Ice Coffee<br /><br />4 Gloria Jean Coffee:<br />Mudslide<br />French Vanilla Supreme<br />Butter Toffee<br />Hazelnut<br /><br />1 Timothy's:<br />Kahula Original<br /><br />5 Grove Square:<br />2 French Vanilla Cappuccino<br />Hazelnut Cappuccino<br />Spiced Apple Cider<br />Caramel Apple<br /><br />So, as you can see about half of my order was made up of hazelnut (4) and french vanilla (7). However, I fully read the description and completely understand the concept of a ""grab bag"" so I'm not unhappy with what I received.  Luckily for me, I also love french vanilla."
"This was my first order of k-cups and I was looking to try various types of flavored coffees.  In a 34 cup variety pack, I received 13 different flavors from 4 roasters.  While the overall variety was nice, the # of cups per variety varied:  1 cup for 4 different flavors, 2 cups for 4 different flavors; 3 cups for 1 flavor; 4 cups for 2 flavors; 5 cups for 1 flavor; and 6 cups for 1 flavor.  I'm a bit disappointed in the # of cups per flavor wasn't more consistent as both my husband and I wanted to try each flavor we received.  Also, I suspect that some of the cups may be old as the 14 of the 34 cups are holiday flavors from past holidays last year (it's June 2012 and I rec'd 4 cups each of spicy eggnog & gingerbread and 6 cups of pumpkin spice)."
"Yes .... It does come in a paper bag but that didn't bother me since it is an assortment and they probably mix in cups from boxes to make these for people. They're we're different varieties of cappicuccino versions, donut house, even two over ice choices and a sleepy time tea. So you really get to try different types and things. There are about 5 weird favors I got which I may or may not try or leave for guest to try out being ... Coconut, Eggnog, ... Blueberry ... Stuff like that. Those normally aren't things I would drink but then again it's nice to be creative and different. Will buy again."
Lots of different flavors! Only 1 duplicate! Would deffinately buy again! Did come in a paper bag so if you're ordering for a gift be aware!
"I just received the sampler a few days after I ordered it. The K-cups were in a brown paper bag and stapled close. It was wrapped in an air wrap so they weren't damaged in any way. I thought it was a little odd that they were just in a paper bag, but it doesn't really matter. I got these for my mom for her birthday so I just put them in another bag. There were several different flavors. Overall, no complaints; reasonably priced. I've read a few negative reviews, but they seem to be rare. If you're looking for some K-cups, go for it."
"The cost of this is excellent when you include it under super shipper savings. You can't beat the price of a variety of coffees. I did get a lot of one brand and a lot of one type over others, but expected that. It came in a brown paper bag, stapled shut. I didn't mind that at all, I just dump it all in my K-cup drawer anyway! I will purchase again. Here is what I got:<br /><br />8 - Green Mountain Gingerbread<br />5 - Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice<br />3 - Green Mountain French Vanilla<br />1 - Green Mountain Carmel Vanilla Cream<br />2 - Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />2 - Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Gloria Jean French Vanilla<br />3 - Gloria Jean Hazelnut<br />1 - Gloria Jean Butter Toffee<br />2 - Kahlua: Kahlua Original<br />1 - Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Denise"
"Enjoyed having a different flavor of coffee when I desired, that is the advantage of<br /> having the Keurig for the variety without purchasing large quantities of different coffees.<br />I continue to think the cost must go down on these K-cups."
The selection was nice and gives you a chance to try different products prior to purchasing an entire box.  I would highly recommend this product.
Very fast response to process order no delays during shippment and product came as described and nothing was missing. Overall very satisfied
"I'm half way thru my supply of 24 k cup sampler, and I am enjoying each and everyone. Would order it again."
Everything was as describe. fast shipping and also receive a great variety of flavors.. If you want to try different samples I recommend getting this.. great value :)
The package arrived promptly and there was an unusual assortment of flavors inside. I bought this for the unit night nurses and it was nearly gone by the morning. I came back and bought another along with a full box of breakfast blend for the more traditional coffee drinkers.
"The sampler had a pretty good selection of flavored coffee, but the least desirable flavors (with the worst reviews) were the most prevalent.  Im not sure why they would include 1 or 2 samples of the highly rated coffee, and 6 samples of the very low rated coffee.  Maybe they were just trying to clear out some coffee they couldn't sell otherwise. If they would put 2-3 samples of every coffee, the customer could sample more variety. I did give a rating of 3 stars because there were some good flavors included, and I found a couple of new favorites."
"If your intent on purchasing this variety pack is to get the exact flavors listed in the possible selections, you will not be happy.  However, if your intent is to try a variety of different coffee flavors to see what is available what you like, you'll love this sample selection.  Others have complained about it coming in a brown paper bag... who cares!!!!  It's a great value for a nice selection and a great price. Go for it!"
"I was really looking forward to a true sampler pack, but I was a bit disappointed in the selection. I got a handful of random flavors then A LOT of three different flavors. One had 8 of the same kind."
"This is a great, inexpensive assortment of K-cups for your Keurig coffee maker.  There is a great variety of bold, medium and light roast coffees.  I also got 3 different kinds of tea, and two hot chocolates.  There was also a great variety of flavored coffees as well. None of the cups were expired or broken as other reviews had mentioned.  It does come in just a plastic bag, but that didn't bother me because I just took them all out of the bag and put them in my drawer. I just placed my second order of this variety pack and I can't wait to see what I get.  It's a great deal, with lots of variety.  I highly recommend it!"
"This was good because it did give you a different kind of k cup and not too many of the same kind.<br /><br />The packaging can be improved as it comes in a box and inside all the assortment is in a brown bag. I understand they pick the different k cups from their boxes of flavors, but it could be presented better.<br /><br />Okay deal for the price."
"I have ordered this on one other occasion and was looking forward to getting a nice variety instead out of 24 containers I got 7 Caramel Vanilla Creme, 3 Kaluha, 3 Wild Blueberry, 3 Southern Pecan, 3 Hazelnut, 1 Glazed Chocolate Donut, 1 French Vanilla, 1 Butter Toffee, 1 Mudslide, 1 Mocha Nut Fudge.  I was hoping for a better variety not 7 of one flavor especially since I have had that one and did not care for it."
"Gift for daughter, she was in ""love"" with the coffee. Will be buying this item again. I will be letting other know about the great deal with this."
These flavored coffee k-cups were exactly as expected and were received on time. The flavor assoetment allowed us new k-cup users the ability to try various flavors.
"Had no problem with this order and was for the most part pleased.  First of all, I am not a fussy coffee drinker so it didn't bother me that I didn't get all that was displayed on order.  I still got a good variety.  I didn't give it a 5 star because it would have been nicer if I hadn't got so many of the ""fall"" flavors.  Not that I don't like them but there were a little too many hazelnuts and pumpkin flavors.  Again, still had a good variety.  Would I order this again.....absolutely.  Great deal."
"Despite all the negative reviews that people left about getting many of the same flavors, I pressed my luck and ordered. I guess the company got the message because I just opened the box up and inventoried - 24 distinct flavors and not a single repeat! I am very pleased with the selection and would definitely order again."
"Very Satisfied with order !!!  No doubles like everyone eles said.  Great flavors, and everything in great condition.  I will be ordering more from them when I start to get low."
Each one better than the last. Quite tasty and enjoyable. It gives you a chance to try something different. They are nice to have as an after dinner treat.
"Not very much variety of flavors.  Got mainly five of the Green Mountain flavors with about three singles of other flavors.  Not very good for a variety pack.  Good coffee, though.<br /><br />I am disappoint."
"I don't mind that this assortment came in a brown bag - I use the K-cups quickly so who cares what box they came in. And the 24 cup package was the best deal I've found anywhere. However, I agree with others who noted that the assortment was poor. Most were Green Mountain Blueberry or Hazelnut - not much variety at all."
"I was a little worried by some of the reviews which indicated that the assortment might not be very assorted.  But I was very happy with my order.  The most repeats of any given flavor was 3.  I received 3 each of several flavors, and one or two each of the rest.  All told, there must have been about 12 different varieties.  Well done!  If I didn't already have a huge amount of K-cups here, I would immediately order two more of these variety packs.  Hopefully they will still be offering this at the same price in a few months when it is time to get more.<br /><br />Decided to just order two more of these 24-pack assortments, and they were even better than the first one reviewed above.  This time, there were 24 different k-cups in each one!  Fabulous!  My only quibble is that they were packed in cardboard boxes that were open and placed upside down in the shipping carton.  So when I grabbed the first box and lifted it out of the carton, all the K-cups spilled out into the carton.  Not a big deal, but how hard is it to tape the box shut, or at least put it right side up in the shipping carton?  In any event, was so happy with the assortment, that I will probably order two more."
"I have wanted to try flavored coffee but didn't want to take the chance of buying a whole box and not likely the flavor. This was a good solution. I read the few reviews and took chance. Well I'm a little dissapointed. Most of the box expires by December which isn't to big of deal because I'll have them gone by then, but the assortment sucked. At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of ""french vanilla"" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla. Oh and top it off, those 5 or 6 are the only different brands too. The rest of the box is Van Houtte coffee."
"I have been purchasing K-Kups for over a year now and most of the time I purchase them from on-line vendors.  They are always packaged very carefully, in single layers, neatly lined up and protected by a layer of cardboard.  This particular vendor delivered my order in a timely fashion, but neglected to package them with care.  They just threw 24 K-cups into a box and closed it for shipping.  3 out of the 24 were damaged/punctured.  Very disappointed, will go elsewhere from now on."
"I spent a lot of time trying to decide on a variety sampler pack of K-cups.  Reading the description of this set, I was excited to order, since there were so many flavors that I hadn't tried before.  If you read the list of flavors, it sounds great!  But...the bag I received was really lacking in excitement.  I understand that they couldn't include everything listed and that the collection might vary somewhat.  But there were NONE of the following from their list:  Rain Forest Nut, Pumpkin Spice, Mocha Nut Fudge, Island Coconut, Caramel Vanilla Creme, Mudslide, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Vanilla Cupcake, Pecan Praline.  Of ALL of those flavors, I would have thought ONE of them would show up.  I received SEVEN of one kind, Jamaican Me Crazy.  So, that's more than a quarter of the sampler being the very same kind.  I wish more care was taken to pack the K-cups with more thought for the customer.  I am not one of those grouchy reviewers who is never pleased with anything.  But, sadly, I was disappointed in this purchase."
"I'm glad I ordered this without reading the negative reviews, but even if I had at least I have the reading comprehension to understand that the two things most people are complaining about are actually listed IN THE DESCRIPTION. Who buys something online without reading the description first? Honestly...<br /><br />1. Yes it comes in a brown paper/zip lock bag. Whoop de doo. You could still give it as a gift, just get your own cellophane bag and tie it off with ribbons. If you have a lot of friends with keurig machines you'd be able to pick a couple flavors for each friend, and it would be adorable to do a little gift bag with a coffee cup and these.<br /><br />2. Yes some of the coffees were ones I don't like, and yes some of them were repeats, that's what happens when you order a grab bag. It flat out states in the description that you will most likely NOT get 1 pack of each of the flavors, and that the flavors listed are EXAMPLES, you are not guaranteed which ones you will receive.<br /><br />If you can't accept those two ""downsides"" don't get this product. Instead try Keurig K-Cups Travel The World Sampler Pack (35 K-Cups) Those are supposedly the same every time, and the gift box is supposedly adorable. Twice the price, but hey, if it's what you're looking for...<br /><br />As for myself, all of the cups arrived in fine condition. Yes I did get an overage of a particular flavor(I'm really fortunate that I love hazelnut coffee) but I liked that many of them were multiples. Since I live with my boyfriend this mean that we can each try a cup of the flavors with extras. And if we don't like one we can save it for when company comes, someone we know will probably enjoy the cup.<br /><br />As a service that allows you to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy a box of each this was cheap and pretty effective. I'll be purchasing again, and next time I'll be sure to come on here and put in which flavors I get, I didn't write them down this time, and they're all mixed in with some other samplers now."
"I love flavored K-Cups and was so excited to see a variety package offered on K-cups because I just couldnt decide between pumpkin spice, chocolate donut, cinnamon pecan, butter toffee and vanilla cupcake!!<br />So when the 24 count variety pack was offered I was excited to get a small sampling of everything.<br />It arrived today with only 23 cups, and like 3 or 4 of the same flavors, and not good ones!!<br />4 Blueberry mountains(yuck) 3 irish cream blah!<br />I guess I should have realized this could happen but still wish I had gotten at least 15 different flavors and ones I wanted try and that.<br />Buyer beware."
"Very dissatisfied.  I ordered this variety of K cups because of the wonderful assortment of flavored coffees.  I don't like to drink straight black coffee of any kind, so I was excited that I would be getting something of a treat to look forward to.  This was not the case.  I received it 2 days ago and when I opened it, found only 4 flavored coffees in the whole 24 pack; 2 each pumpkin spice and spiced eggnog.  The rest of the entire order was non-flavored, regular coffee.  I am totally disappointed and upset that I didn't receive at all what I wanted and paid for.  Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this company again."
"Very disappointed in this vendor.  I ordered what I thought would be flavored gourmet coffees......what I received was mostly UNFLAVORED coffee and a few pumpkin spike and gingerbread flavor.  AND, I received UNFLAVORED FOLGERS COFFEE! I thought I was ordering all flavored coffees, and what I received what not even close.  I can buy Folgers K-cups at the grocery store. Probably 2/3 of my order was unflavored coffee.  Will never order from them again.  It's definitely overpriced for what you receive.  And, they just throw 24 K-cups in a shipping box and they are loose in the box and with no packing materials to keep them from banging around. Just disgusted......."
This is a joke!!  I have never been so mad as I am right now writing this.  Not only is the coffee a big joke the way they shipped it is as well.  The assortment in this is ridiculous.  The majority of the coffee is french vanilla.  And hopefully we will like spicy eggnog and kahlua because those make up pretty much the rest of the coffee.  This looks like somebody threw in the coffee they didn't like into a box and sent it to the sucker who was stupid enough to buy it.  I am not usually this brutall with reviews but this angers me.  The coffee was in a brown paper bag and thrown in a box to ship.  If I could return this I would but this is not a purchase that can be returned. How sad this is.
I really liked the idea of not knowing what flavors I would be getting almost like a treasure hunt. I was happy with all the flavors I received. Many of which I have never tried but always wanted to. Service was excellent. Will buy from again. None of the coffees were expired.
"WARNING!! DO NOT PURCHASE!! This is a mixture of any flavors that cannot be sold. It comes in a flimsy, torn paper bag that is stapled at the top. Mine were mostly eggnog, a flavor I hate, and that was never even mentioned in the list of possible flavors. There were no coffee house K-cups and no Van Houten, two brands that I wanted to try. There's no way this was random either. I got six hazelnut which I buy in bulk every month, six blueberry, eight egg nog and then an assortment, one each, of four ""random"" flavors. The K-cups are flat and ragged looking, which means they are probably old or damaged. This is simply a way to get rid of damaged merchandise--open boxes or undesirable flavors. I expect better of Amazon!"
"The first time I purchased one of these packs, I got a really nice variety of coffees.  The second time, I got virtually no ""regular"" coffee...just a ton of flavored coffee and unusual flavors at that."
"Because of the picture and description, I expected 34 different coffees, perhaps with a few duplicates. What I didn't expect to get was 6 Green Mountain French Vanilla, 6 Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette, 6 Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream, and 4 Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry. I also received 2 each of 5 other flavored, and 1 each of 2 other flavors.  This is not my opinion of 34 different flavors."
"Just recieved this box and was very pleased.  In this box of 24 k-cups there were 11 different flavors, of not more than 3 of any one (most 2).  I like flavored iced coffee in the summer and this is a great way to have some variety!<br /><br />K-Cup Coffee for Keurig Brewers, Flavored Coffee Sampler Pack"
Was a bit unhappy with the shipment..6 of them were butter toffee. I felt like that was a kind that they were trying to get rid of.  I read the reviews and decided to take a chance...what I got was just ok.  Would not reorder.
I have ordered from this seller before and it's always a good experience. The product is exactly as advertised and it's always a pleasure getting so many different flavors in one buy. I will continue to buy from this great seller.
"well it happened to me.. twice !! I ordered the first time and it was from Amazon and I got a Great variety.. even an Iced Coffee and 2 Decaffs .. next time I ordered the 34 (from a different vendor)and got like 9 of one flavor.. I have so many French Vanilla it's cumming out my ears !!  Well.. I ordered once again, I thought the one from the original (the 24 pack) .. well now I just got like 4 of one flavor and 2 or 3 of just a few to make up the 24.. Not happy at all.. but then again I sit at my computer for like 4 minutes in the morning before work hit submit and in two days there behind my door !!  sooooo hummm if you weigh them.. I love my k-cups !!  LOL  enjoy"
"What we were hoping for:<br /><br />Something a little more like the picture.  We were especially excited to try Chocolate Glazed Donut and Pumpkin Spice.<br /><br />What we got:<br /><br />6 - Hazelnut Noisette<br />6 - Caramel Vanilla Creme<br />6 - French Vanilla<br />4 - Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 - Cinammon Roll<br />3 - Southern Pecan<br />2 - Butter Toffee<br />2 - Mocha Nut Fudge<br />1 - Mudslide<br />1 - French Vanilla Supreme<br /><br />Sadly, we already have entire boxes of Wild Mountain Blueberry and Caramel Vanilla Creme, and the ones we were most interested in from this bunch we only got one or two of.  My mistake for not reading the reviews, but I disagree with the guy who said that the description covers the sellers behind when it comes to variety.  The description says that a buyer will get a ""wide variety"" and I hardly think 3 flavors comprising more than half of the package qualifies as ""wide variety"".  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  If I would have bought these flavors on the Keurig website, I would have paid less per K-cup than I paid for this package... and I paid the higher price specifically for the variety.  I do not feel I got what I paid for and I think Amazon should not allow this seller to continue falsely advertising.<br /><br />Final note:  The K-cups came in a paper bag ... with no visible expiration dates.  One of them was punctured on top.  Considering some of the other reviews, I am worried about whether or not these K-cups are even good anymore.  Some of the other reviews suggest that at least some people received theirs in a box with expiration dates included."
"9 of 24 were the same thing:  Caramel Vanilla Cream.  And yes, it tastes horrible.  Actually, over half the items were French something, and the rest of the items you got only one of each.  Nor did they come in a box, I got a brown paper bag that someone had thrown whatever hadn't sold well into.  This wasn't an assortment, it was leavings.<br /><br />Both Gloria Jean and Amazon could have done this much better."
I received these and added them to the collection. The variety of flavors was great. It allows me to find those that I really like prior to buying a full box. I recommend these if your just starting out with your coffee maker or if you just want to add some  variety to your stash.
"95% percent of this ""variety"" pack are Green Mountain, and most of the Green Mountain are french vanilla. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to buying. The whole purpose for buying this ""variety"" pack was to see which of the flavored coffees I would enjoy. Very disappointing."
"I have been ordering this for a few months and it started out GREAT. But the last one we received is probably the last one I will order.<br />When we started getting this the selection was a nice variety and was just what we were looking for. But then they began to have bunches of the same flavors and little variety.<br />But the final straw is the package we got today. They usually come it their own box, but this bunch came in a plain brown paper stapled closed bag that was sealed in a plastic bag. This offered little protection to the K-cups, since several of them were slightly damaged. Plus, all but one of the K-cups was Green Mountain flavors and there were many of the same flavors.<br />Basically, I believe I would of been better off just ordering the Green Mountain flavors we like, it would of been cheaper in the long run."
"What a great deal to have the K cups delivered for free!  Since the price was $26, there was no charge for delivery!  All the flavors were great tasting!  Would buy the K cups here again, since it was cheaper than buying they at the store."
"If you are wanting to try alot of different flavors (as I was) this is not a good choice. (See the disclaimer at end of expl. saying SOME flavors may be substituted.) We received: Chocolate Glazed Donut, Cinnamon Roll, Hazelnut, Hazelnut Decaf, French Vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge,  Wild Mountain Blueberry, Kahlua, Creme Caramel,  Caramel Cappuccino.<br />Did not get: Butter Toffee, French Vanilla Supreme, Mudslide, Hazelnut, Caramel Vanilla Cream, French Vanilla Decaf, Southern Pecan, Creme Caramel, Hawaiian Hazelnut, Jamaica Me Crazy, Vanilla Francaise, French Vanilla Iced Coffee, Hazelnut Cappuccino, French Vanilla Cappuccino.<br />Some flavors we got one of, two we got 5 of the same! I could see switching one or two, but this many is crazy."
"with so many choices, we were on a caffeine high after choosing one of this.. one of that.. now try this one.. but, i wish there would have been even more variety. some of the flavors only had one k-cup while the hazelnut and french vanilla had 7 or 8 each."
"Before buying this product, I was worried that there wouldn't be enough variety.  When I received the package which contained the K cups packed into a brown paper lunchbag [they did indicate that this is the way they are shipped], I was very excited to see what flavors were inside!  It felt like Christmas morning.  I was pleased to find that all of the K cups were intact and there were a wide variety of flavors, including seasonal and special edition flavors.  Yes, there are a few flavors that are in particular abundance, but they are the most commonly enjoyed flavors so I think it is reasonable.  There are a lot of Green Mountain flavors which I have no problem with because Green Mountain coffee is excellent.  I was happy when I saw 2 Timothy's Kahlua K cups because that's a flavor I've really been wanting to try!  Here's the tally:<br />Green Mountain Coffee French Vanilla 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Hazelnut Noisette 6<br />Timothy's Kahlua 2<br />Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry 4<br />Green Mountain Coffee Gingerbread 2<br />Gloria Jean's Mudslide 2<br />Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream 6<br />Green Mountain Coffee Southern Pecan 1<br />Green Mountain Coffee Mocha Nut Fudge 1<br />Total 35<br />That's right... I ordered the 34 count and they sent me 35.  The 35 count is $2.12 more than the 34 count on Amazon, so this decision definitely paid off!  That was generous, or perhaps clumsy of the sellers.  Either way, I will take this in a positive light.  Overall it was a good purchase!"
"Although I expected an occasional flavor to be switched out due to availability, I did not expect 7 or more of the pictured flavors to not be present at all in our order. And they were all replaced with extra vanilla flavored and hazelnut flavored coffees. From a 35 sampler, we received approximately 15 different flavors, most of which were the more common flavors that we had already tried. Disappointing because we were looking forward to trying new flavors!"
I shop thru Amazon A LOT and I am totally surprised that they would deal with a vendor like this.  Variety?????what variety???  I received this today and just could not believe the lack of variety.  Mostly Green Mountain cups....and 4 or 5 of the same flavor.  None of the flavors that I was looking forward to trying.  I will NOT be ordering k-cups from this vendor EVER again!
"I was hoping it would have a good sampling of different coffees, I read the previous reviews and thought I would take a chance and maybe I would be lucky to get an assortment. 23 out of 24 were the Green Mountain brand. There were 6 french vanilla and 6 caramel vanilla creme. There were 5 blueberry and 4 hazelnut. There was one pumpkin spice, one gingerbread, and one kahlua. I was hoping for a few different brands besides Green Mountain since this is the brand we have at work. They arrived in a paper bag. I will not be buying from this company again. Disappointed!"
"Was dissappointed with what was sent in a paper bag, not a box.  The flavors were NOT what was pictured, not even close.  No expiration dates given but I can tell they are expired by the flavors sent to me in Feburary.  Pumpkin Spice and Gingerbread are not fresh flavors. Too bad I opened the paper bag or this would have been the first thing I ever sent back. Would not recommend."
"The coffees samples are good, although not all of my likings. Kahlua is great, Donut House is also good. Timothy's is rather bland. The flavored Green Mountain coffees caffeine level is rather low unfortunately."
"This variety oack is a great way to sample several of the flavors green mountain has to offer.  I would have preferred to receive more than one of the cinnamon roll and fewer of some of the other flavors.  I don't know if this is random, or planned."
The variety of coffee that I received was Great. The price was outstanding as well. I would definitely purchase the variety pack again!
"Variety wasn't as good as other variety packs I've purchased from other sellers.  But not bad.  Right amount of cups, good cost per unit."
Purchased this so that I could get a combination pack and had a good variety. Kind of a sampler pack.
Enjoyed the opportunity to taste many flavors and as part of the process to know which I will order in the future and those others  -  well perhaps someone else might enjoy. Thank you
Received 5 of 1 flavor 4 of another 3 of another 2 of 3 others and only 1 of the other 6. I ordered 2 bags of 24 so i got 10 of the one i did not like. 9 of them went in the trash. You should send 2 of each  so there is an equal sampling. It seems like i was sent what you had the most of and needed to get rid of.
I had bought this pack because it was my first K-Cup coffee maker. I would have given 4 stars for the variety but I am not a flavored coffee drinker and most of the coffees were of that type.
"Here is what I received:<br /><br />7 Hazelnut (1 Gloria Jeans, 6 Green Mountain)<br />6 Caramel Vanilla Cream<br />9 French Vanilla (1 Gloria Jeans, 8 Green Mountain)<br />4 Butter Toffee<br />3 Spicy Eggnog (out of season for February)<br />2 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br />2 Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />1 Kahlua<br />1 Golden French Toast<br /><br />Not a terrible assortment but if you are expecting to get a wide variety of flavors that you don't see everywhere then look elsewhere...this is not the pack for you.  If I wanted 9 French Vanillas I would have just bought a box of them."
"The items are packed in a paper bag, but ours arrived in good shape.  We received a good variety of coffee and I think it is a good value for what we got.  Our package had about 10 different favors and no more than 5 of any one favor. I think this will help me narrow down what I like.  If you are looking for a sampler, give this one a try."
"Great Product for the price!!! Did not expect to get so many of the same flavor ""French Vanilla"". But was glad I did."
"When I first received this box I was a little confused as they were all loose in a box; however, when I saw all the great flavors that I received I was happy with the product!  One was broken . . . but other than that all the samples were in tact and as far as I could tell not expired.  Will probably use them again!"
Coffee arrived before said arrival date and everything is as advertised. I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes the K cup.
Purchased this item as a gift along with a world sampler for my son and daughter-in-law who have a new k-cup machine.  They really liked it and made a list of their favorites.
"Based on the reviews, you take your chances when ordering.  I decided to try it. I got about 7 different flavors - nothing terribly exotic but I did learn I really like blueberry coffee which I never would have ordered on my own!  So I may order again - it's kinda fun to see what you get.  Does come in just a brown paper bag (like a large lunch bag) but I didn't care about that. It would be nice if they tried harder to get more of a mix of flavors.  The cups were still about $.75 each so it's not like they are so reduced in price, that you should be happy to get any assortment (and they do save on the packaging)."
"The ones I have tried were good, but some I am not sure I would try. I would NOT buy another sampler. I will buy only coffee or other K-cups that I like. OK,Spicy Eggnog, Pumpkin Spice I would NOT have bought!!"
Enjoyed the varied cups and manufacturers...great to try coffee without committing to a large amount of any one type.  Will try again.
"Having never owned a Keurig coffee maker before, I had no idea what brand or flavor of K-cup to try.  This was an enjoyable way to discover what I liked the best."
I was shocked to find my k-cups were packaged in a zip locked bag. Some of the cups were damaged and expired.
This is the best mixed coffee selection ever! It has coffee in it that is very hard (if all) to find! Very happy with this purchase!
I read some negative reviews on this item but decided to take a chance hoping I would receive a good assortment of flavored coffees. I am extremely pleased with the assortment of flavors I received. Flavors I didn't even know they had. None of them are even close to expiring and they were all received well packed with no damage. The box is plain as mentioned but that is perfectly fine with me. I will definitely continue to buy this product.
Not the best price perhaps but a great mix of many interesting flavors. Do not regret this purchase at all! If you want to try both flavored and unflavored coffees this is a good choice for you.
"I was impressed with the variety of flavors in my sampler. No more than 2 of each, and a good assortment overall. I will definitely buy again, thank you!"
I am very impressed with this company's focus on customer satisfaction. There was a minor error with my initial order. I contacted the ZShop regarding the issue. I received a response back in less than 24 hours with an apology for the error and details regarding how the situation would be resolved. I received my corrected order within a few days. The flavor selection was terrific. The ones that I've tried so far have tasted great! Quality product and quality service. I will definitely be buying again!
My variety pack consisted of no more than 3 of the same k cup.  The product description given in the possibilities for k cups was accurate.  I did not get all of the options listed (it clearly states that you *may* receive those k cups) but I also did not get anything that was not listed.  There were no surprises.  It arrived within 2 days (I have Amazon Prime).  This was a good option for me as a new coffee drinker to learn what I liked at a good price.  I highly recommend this variety pack.
"With all these bad reviews, you'd think this would be a bad product. I didn't think so at all. I got 22 different kinds. The other two cups were mudslide. There was one flavor out of 23 that I didn't enjoy. The blueberry flavor was absolutely awful. My boyfriend liked it though, so no complaints here! I will definitely purchase this again.<br /><br />For all you people that receive 4 - 5 of the same cups, you should have read the reviews first. If you did, and thought ""Huh, I'll take a chance"", it's your own fault. I'd rather get this even if I got only four different kinds. Its better than an entire box of the SAME kind."
"I just received my 24 K-cup variety pack & was a little disappointed.  They were all thrown in a brown paper bag in the shipping box which certainly wasn't very appealing.  Also disappointed in the variety.  Out of the 24, there are (5) Gingerbread, (3) Southern Pecan, & (3) Pumpkin Spice, which are all Limited Edition for the holidays.  That's about half the ""variety"" in only 3 flavors. I guess they have to get rid of these flavors. Will not order this variety pack again!"
"I saw this and thought it was going to be a wonderful way to try some of the diff kinds of k-cups without buying an entire box. I was a little disappointed today when my order came in. Half the bag (brown paper lunch bag) was one flavor, another 1/4 of them were a flavor and then I got 1 of a few others. I thought I'd get to try more than 5 kinds with getting 24 cups.<br /><br />I might give it another try, but not sure yet."
"I have ordered this variety pack twice, it has good selections and was shipped to me fairly quickly considering it was the holiday rush season. I would purchase this again. Note they come shipped in a packing box just thrown in and packed down with brown paper. I counted them and both times they were all there and none of them were expired or damaged upon my inspection. If you can get over the fact there is no appeal to the packaging this supply should do just fine."
I got a fabulous assortment of flavored coffees.  I got the 35 pack and there were at least 12 different flavors!!!  Very satisfied with my purchase.  It was a great way to get tons of options without breaking the bank!!!  Will buy again.
Product arrived ahead of schedule.  It was in excellent condition.  The price was reasonable.  I would buy this product again.
Awesome sampler and fast shipping! Just make sure you open the package. They repackage it in one of the flavors boxes but you get 12 different kinds of coffee (2 of each)
"I got a new Keurig coffee maker for Christmas, which was exciting to me, because I often want one cup of flavored coffee in the evening. So I went right to Amazon and found this great idea - a sampler of flavored coffees!  I thought this would be perfect, so I could find out which ones I'd like.  But when they arrived today, only half of them were flavored and the other half were non-flavored coffee.  And all of the flavored ones are doubles, so all in all I got 6 flavors.  What a disappointment! I feel like I wasted my money, because the coffee maker already came with a sampler of regular coffees."
"I am new to kcup, I got this because I wanted a variety to try out different flavors and find what I like.<br />First, I like most of the flavors, so this is still a bargain to get some variety just to have different flavors around.<br />However, the variety was lacking of 35<br /><br />7 were pumpkin spice<br />6 were ginger bread<br />6 were french vanilla<br />5 were hazelnut<br /><br />Thats 24 of 35 right there. I was just hoping for maybe a little more variety, I will order again, and hopefully atleast get different ones."
"We just purchased the Keurig brewer and I'm in love.  Yes, it came with samples (4 boxes) with apple cider and hot chocolate.  However, I wanted to try other coffees.  I have to know what I like.  Of course, I searched, and came to Amazon.  My go to place.  They have the best prices and biggest selection!!  I love this sample.  Actually, I think we are done with most of it!!  If you would like to test a variety, then I would recommend purchasing this!  It gave us a try on the various k-cups available at a reasonable price!"
"My husband bought me the Kuereg so I could make my flavored coffee and he could have his traditional coffee.  I was looking forward to trying many new flavors and was disappointed that 1/2 of the flavors were French Vanilla and Hazelnut which are flavors that can be found any place you go.  I wanted to try some flavors not normally found in the grocery store.  Having said that, there were 7 k-cups of pumpkin spice which I found to be fantastic and will order.  There were three other flavors that I am looking forward to trying.  I am going to try to order this again and may change my review.<br /><br />Updated Review:  I went ahead and tried ordering this package again and couldn't be more pleased.  It was exactly what I had expected the first time around. Of the 35 I received, I had four different kinds of hazelnut, four different kinds of vanilla, and then the rest were different flavors.  I had only four duplicates so I will get to try a good variety.  I left it at four stars because of the disappointment of the first order."
I bought this for my husband and was excited to find a flavored sample pack for him to try a variety before buying an entire box. When they arrived I was very disappointed to see that 18 out of 24 of them where not a flavored coffee but just plain regular coffee.  Then the remaining 6 where the same to flavors. I'm very disappointed and will deff be sending them back and getting a refund. I just wish I would read the reviews before buying.
"Unlike most of the negative comments, I received a great variety of flavored coffees (GM pumpkin spice, GM hazelnut noire, GM blueberry, GM southern pecan, GM french vanilla, TH kahlua, GM chocolate glazed donut, as well as some others).  Yes, it came in a brown bag, but it was well packaged inside the amazon box.  Great deal!  Would definitely buy again."
"Received package today, which is very quick shipping.  Disappointed in the sampler pack.  Out of 24 k-cups, 7 are Caramel Vanilla Cream, and 5 are French Vanilla, which makes half of the box vanilla.  (Good thing I like vanilla, hope I like these) Being shipped in a brown paper bag in the box really doesn't bother me, I just wish there were more samples in the Sampler.  I probably will not order again."
On time and product as advertised. Good selection of various flavors. This is a good way to try out what's available without commiting to any specific flavor. I would buy again.
"Comes in a plain brown paper bag!!!! I was shocked and disappointed that this was packaged in a plain brown paper bag, no box, nothing but a plain brown paper bag.."
Nice selection of some very tasty coffees.  We just love the new Keurig and the coffee selections that this box gave us.  Great gift as well.
"Got this with my new keurig. Good variety of coffees. Most of the listed flavors are there. Good way to sample and find what you like before buying a  box of just one flavor. One tea, some Bold blends, flavors....most were pretty good."
"The flavors are too artificial for me. I had a good selection from different companies and if your coffee tastes are not yet set, it's a start."
the variety was great as i love flavored coffee the packaging could be better as one of the cups was opened but amazon quickly took care of that great deal..
"I can not believe the lack of packaging from this company!! The coffee k-cups were thrown into a Ziploc baggie...then shipped! I had intended to give this as a Christmas gift, but am unable to do so now. It looks like I have just gone to my own cabinet and thrown some stuff in a bag.There is no expiration date on the bag, so as far as I know, the k-cups could already be expired and the company is just trying to move their leftover stock onto the unsuspecting consumer. Additionally, the lack of variety was disheartening. I will NEVER buy from the BECCO Corp. again. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most certainly would! I would also add that although the advertisement was for caffeinated coffee only, I received several decaffeinated coffees. Oh,and I have already checked to see if I could return this item. I can not because it is a grocery item and they are non-returnable. To summarize...buyer beware!"
"This ""34"" pack is really only 13 kinds of coffee, with multiple of the gross kinds (who wants SIX Island Coconut coffees?!) and it comes in a PAPER BAG!  Don't waste your money!"
"This is a great buy for all the different flavors you get.  I love that some of them have 2 cups of the same flavor, so you can enjoy the flavor again.  I shared it with a friend so it was easy to split.  They definitely gathered great flavors together. MMMMMM!! The speed of the shipping was amazing!!! GREAT ASSET TO YOUR KEURIG MACHINE!"
"One would expect a 35 variety pack to contain a little variety. 10 flavors(6,6,6,4,3,3,3,2,1,1) and 27 of the KCups from Green Mountain.<br />Not impressed with the selection.  Will be returning."
"I ordered this thinking it would come properly packaged. What I got was a bunch of coffee single serves in a brown paper bag.<br />I can't believe Amazon would sell something packaged like this. You wouldn't buy this if it was at a yard sell.<br />Very, very disappointed in what I got."
"I ordered these as a gift and they came in a brown paper bag. That's it. How does one give a gift that comes in a brown paper bag? Should have went to a retail store. Makes me wonder what the quality is. Did they just pick them up off of the floor and put random ones in a bag? Also, if your looking for a majority of eggnog flavored coffee, I certainly got a disproportionate amount. Merry Christmas."
"This ""variety"" pack just came in today.  There were 7 french vanilla and 7 gingerbread. This does not seem very random."
"Six of the 24 K-cups were one flavor - Wild Mountain Blueberry.  Ugh.  I wouldn't mind one or two weird flavors, but six?"
I bought these for a grab bag Christmas gift exchange. I figured they would come in some sort of box I could wrap. Instead I get a lunch-bag full of cups stapled shut. I had to go out and buy something else. Very dissapointed
"I had no idea that I ordered 24 LOOSE Kcups.  This is a gift and it looks stupid...I guess I will put them in a gift bag???  I hope the person has a carousel.  Not impressed, hopefully they taste good.  Some are also dented because there was no padding or protection in the box.  NOT EVEN AN INVOICE!!!!"
Wow! A dollar each for some K Cups?  What are they thinking.  This is way too much for a sampler.
"I ordered this variety pack as a gift.  The shipment arrived today, the K Cups are literally packed in a brown paper bag!  No box, a brown paper bag!  I am going to have to use these for myself & go to the store & buy another box to give with the coffee pot for Christmas. Very dissapointed."
I have had many coffee K-cups over the last five years but this was better than most. All of the k-cups were excellent...Thanks
"I received the variety pack as a gift, but I don't have a single cup machine. Since ""grocery"" items are not returnable, I tried mixing it with the regular coffee in the filter for a different taste. Unfortunately, the packet clogged the filter and it overran onto the counter. Now, I have a mess to clean. Gracious gift givers, please check what you recipient has before sending."
"This was sort of a sampler of the coffees listed but...they mostly put in flavors no one would buy.. Blueberry, eggnog pumpkin,,,yuk,,, skip this one"
I love Keurig coffee and this is an excellent mix of flavors. Keurig coffee is so much better than regular coffee. I find myself a lot more awake in the mornings from these yummy and just bold enough flavors. :)
The idea for this is great! Unfortunately I received three flavors (6-7 count of each) and then three other falors (1 each). I was hoping that they would be more evenly disbursed between the 24.
These were packaged so poorly that I am actually afriad to drink any of them because they looked tampered with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I got 2-4 of each.  i wish i couldnt had better flavors, but the ones i got are acceptable and i got about 10 different flavors. great variety."
"This purchase was disappointing. It was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter, the selection was poor, the packaging was a brown paper bag with a label. I see from the reviews some lucky folks received a box. I always try to give a positive review...this one not so much!"
"If you're going to give this as a gift, make sure you have your own Box! I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a relative....it showed up in a ""Brown Paper Bag"" stapled at the top!"
Found some good sounding coffee and flavors but did not find the Rain Forest Nut made by Green Mountain. Was a little upset because that was one of the reasons i got this sample pack. All im saying is that the seller should take that off the list because it is discontinued. I was hoping that this seller had some left but guess not. All in all the rest of the sample is good!!!
"Completely Different than what was in the description field of this listing, I have only recieved 2 brands. 26 of which Green Mountain Branded and 8 Gloria Jeans branded only, Most of which are the same making up only 7 types of coffee; (Green Mountain Hazelnut Noisette x7), (GM French Vanilla x6), (GM Caramel Vanilla Cream x6), (GM Wild Mountain Blueberry x4), (Green Mountain Southern Pecan x3),  (Gloria Jeans Butter Coffee x4), (Gloria Jeans French Vanilla Supreme x4). I Don't Understand Is this suppose to be normal?"
"Well....I didn't read all of the negative reviews,. I should have.....very disappointed that 2 of the coffees were decaf....why drink coffee with no caffeine??  I won't be ordering from this vendor again. I should say that otherwise the selection was pretty good."
"While the coffees supplied were good, I was hoping to get a cinnamon roll coffee and got none, oh well. My only gripe is that I bought one to give as a gift and it arrived in a brown paper bag with a printed sticker label on it.  Not very good presentation for a gift. Had I known, I would have ordered something else. I thought, for the price, it should have been packaged appropriately."
"I ordered this sampler because it is titled Flavored K-Cup Sampler. I ended up with only 6 out of the 24 are ""flavored"". The rest are a limited variety of brews and roasts. To be exact, I got 3 gm pumpkin spice, 2 gm spicy eggnog, 1 van houtte french vanilla, 3 caribou blend, 3 gm columbian fair trade select, 3 gm nantucket blend, 3 newman's own special blend, 3 folgers lively columbian, and 3 gm decaf breakfast blend.  Not what I was expecting at all. I should have listened to the other negative reviews and not bought from this seller even after reading the seller's response to some of the negative feedback with promises to revise the way they fill orders. And if you are looking to give this as a gift, the cups come in a zip-loc bag, not that it mattered to me because I am using them in a gift basket. The only positive was the prompt shipping, I expected it tomorrow and it showed up a day early."
"Of the 24 K-Cups I received, 6 of them were Pumpkin Spice (yuck!), 3 were Gingerbread (yuck, and almost the same), and 4 were Cinnamon Roll (almost the same exact taste as the first two!) that means 13 of the 24 were almost the same flavor... not what I'd call a variety"
I should have looked at the types of coffee included in this package......lots of flavors that I do not personally enjoy......otherwise price for contents was great.
Bought this as a Christmas gift and when I opened it I was seriously disappointed. Not very many diverse cups. Most of them were the french vanilla or hazelnut. Will not be buying this assortment again.
"Sample pack is full of off the wall flavors, not worth the money, most I cannot drink. You are better off buying flavors you like from the grocery store."
CAME in a zip loc bag I couldnt even give it as a gift.  They looked beat up like they were old cups from somebody's kitchen  dont be fooled
An excellent holder for all that marvelous coffee!<br /><br />  What could be more accessible than a coffee holder that is so convenient?
"This was advertised to be an assortment of flavors, not 2 different brands of vanilla.  Had I just wanted vanilla coffee I could have just bought a box of that flavor only.  I had intended to try a variety to perhaps find a new flavor or two that I would enjoy.  I was very disappointed that the variety promised did not happen.  My Mother-in-Law enjoys vanilla and I will give these to her.  I will not buy from this vendor again."
"Let me start by saying this is the first negative review I have ever had to write.  I am not a complainer and I have always been very happy with what I purchase from amazon.  This product, however, fell very short of expectations.  It seems as though they took all the crappy flavors and threw them in a bag to push them out the door before they expire.  Not happy at all."
I absolutely love the selection I got.  I will definitley order this again.  It's a fabulous way to try some new flavors without having to buy a whole box of one flavor.  We got several different brands and several different flavors...only a couple duplicates in the whole bag...LOVE IT!
"I looked at a lot of k cup samplers and the reviews were mixed, with many saying they didn't get a good variety of flavors. I decided to try this seller and the variety was awesome! i only got 3 or 4 doubles, most were singles and great flavors i can't wait to try! i'll definitely buy from this seller again."
"This assortment is a great way to try a bunch of flavors.  I love the variety and I'm ordering it again right now!<br /><br />UPDATE: I ordered this a second time; it's that good.  I've only had my Keurig about a month and am loving the different k-cups, trying to find which brands and flavors I like most.  The second batch was different from the first which was nice!!!"
This flavored coffee sampler was exactly what I wanted.  It had a variety of flavors.  I would purchase it again to get the different flavors!
"I love my Keurig machine and also love trying new flavors.  I don't like having to buy an entire box of one flavor, just to find that I don't care for it that much.  I ordered two of these sampler packs and the variety is fantastic!  I have been able to try many flavors, without ending up with leftovers of ones I don't like as much.  There were also samples of flavors I'd never even heard of.  Thanks so much for offering this!"

"Yes, you might pay a little more per cup but you also don't have to worry about getting stuck with 23 K-cups you'll never use. Pumpkin Spice anyone? I received ten different flavors in the this variety pack, some winners, some not, but at least now I know. This is a repackaged item, mine was packed in a brown paper bag, so keep that in mind if it matters to you. I'll order again."
"20 capsule were expired (some expired 8 months ago !!)<br />4 will expire in 10 days.<br />The rest are good to be used for 1-2 months only.<br /><br />Poorly packaged, two capsules were damaged.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have noticed that my package was sold by Liquid Nation not Burley Brew, as listed here."
"I believe that most reviewers usually balance out a product, with the naysayers usually spouting out more negative things that those happy campers.  I was a happy camper with this bag of coffee cups.  All in perfect condition.  Nice selection, some of which I never would have bought (like the Green Mountain wild blueberry, which turned out to be delightfully refreshing cup of coffee).  A lot of Green Mountain, and for me, I really like GM, so that was good.  Only positive constructive criticism, is less hazelnut (although I like it, there was an unproportional lot of them) and more of the oddball flavors, as in not just one of them, make it two or three."
I usually don't write product reviews but I decided that it was necessary this time. I've ordered this coffee sampler several times and the last 2 times I have been disappointed with the variety that I have received.  In both orders I received over a third of the k-cup flavors in hazelnut. I like hazelnut but I thought the idea of a coffee sampler was to get a variety of flavors. I will not be ordering this sampler again!
"I didn't notice how widely distributed the reviews for this were until I received my box. I had several varieties and flavors of coffee so judging from the most negative reviews, the seller either changed their sorting methods or I got lucky. Since this is a random assortment, you should probably expect some differences.<br /><br />If you're particular about your coffee flavors, this may not be the best option. However, if you're looking to try several brands/flavors/styles of coffee, this is a great way to do it without buying 100s of K-cups at the same time! I enjoy waking up to a different flavor of coffee every morning, so this is perfect for me and I'll continue to buy from this seller."
"I was excited to try a variety of new flavors before committing to an entire box of flavored K-cups I might not like. Needless to say I'm disappointed. I should have read the reviews but neglected to do so. When they arrived, The K-Cups were in a beat-up Ziplock bag. I got two flavored coffees - one Golden French Toast, one Pumpkin spice. The rest were Columbian blends or Caribou coffee, and half of what was there was decaf. Nowhere on the description does it mention normal blends or decaf coffee. Several of the K-cups seals had been broken, so more than likely the coffee would be stale. Returning this for a refund."
"This was a great assortment, arrived as a timely shipment, the carton and outside packaging was protective and great! Thanks Amazon"
"Bought this for my dad who is new to k-cups.  He did not know what he liked, so I purchased this sampler.  Low and behold, he likes them all!"
"This package is amazing! So far I have tried 8-10 different flavored coffee k-cups and they have been great!<br /><br />Don't listen to that one post about the K-cups being expired! I got them and they don't expire for 6-7 months! That's plenty of time to drink all of that coffee.<br />Also the packaging that is came in was good, no damaged cups.<br /><br />This package may be a little expensive, but the person who is putting all of this together needs to earn a little money for their trouble! Also, what if you spent $14-$15 on a pack of 24 of some flavor you didn't like? This sampler allows you to try ones so that the other 23 don't go to waste.<br /><br />I love this so much, I am probably going to have to order another one!"
"Tackiest thing I have ever purchased. The cups came in a brown paper bag that was stapled at the top. I am surprised that Amazon would have such a bad vendor. Bad assortment, bad packaging, just bad."
"How does a multimillion dollar company ship a product to it's customers in a paper bag? Yes, it came in a shipping box...but the product itself (24 flavored K-Cups) were all thrown inside an unmarked brown bag and stapled. Leads one to believe that they're cashing in on unsellable broken boxes of K-Cups, sad part is that they're still getting PRIME FULL PRICE!!! Well, a lesson has been learned and I will not purchase this ""item"" again...Thanks Amazon! And by the way, almost a third of the contents were that disgusting GROVE SQUARE brand and various decaf (of which we don't drink!) Such a convenient way to dump your stock of the brands & brews that don't move! Shopping via the internet is okay most times but it can damn sure bite you in the ass as well. The only reason they got ONE STAR is because of the Kahlua Blend, which was very good."
"12 out of 24 units is not an assortment.  Decaf is not coffee, and flavored hot drinks are no<br />excuse for not including coffee in the varities dispensed.  I don't care about the<br />packaging, it gets tossed, but to include only 2 or three coffees is ridiculous.<br />I'll not be buying from this seller in the future. Its safer to buy directly from Keurig."
EXTREMELY disappointed!  I received 15 decaf coffees!  9 were Hazelnut decaf and 6 were French vanilla decaf.  I didn't order a decaf selection.  The selection is horrible.  I will never order this again.
"I was so excited to receive a variety of flavors and brands, but received only 3 different brands and 4 different flavors, most of them were cappuccinos - and I tried them and they were very very weak and sweet. Disappointing."
"I was really wary about ordering this item because of the mixed and substantially negative reviews.  I ordered anyway because it was a great price and thought I would take my chances.  What a wonderful surprise!!!  There were negative reviews concerning the packaging.  The item comes loose in a brown paper bag that has been properly packaged and boxed.  I don't see the problem.  Others posted that the selection was minimal.  That may have been their experience, but not mine.  I ordered 2 of this item (48 K-cups total) and had 21 different flavors, all name brands.  Can't imagine it getting better!!!!  I will say that what induced me to take a chance on the product was the price.  It was substantially lower than the competition.  When I received my shipment, I went back to Amazon to order 4 more and the price has more than tripled!  It is still competitive, but the urgency was eliminated with the price increase."
"Just received product -- only 22 in box.  Will cost me more to exchange than to live with.  I do feel cheated, however."
"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  The product description indicates a variety of caffeinated coffees and five (5) of the 24 k-cups in each of the two (2)  were for cider drinks, iced coffee and DEcaffeinated coffee.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  Twenty percent (20%) of the coffee I received is not what was described and not what I wanted.  I won't buy from this seller again."
"I've never been more dissapointed in an assortment then the package I received today.  Of 34 k-cups, 21 were last years Holiday flavors from Green Mountain.  11 were Gingerbread, 8 Pumpkin Spice and 2 Spicy Eggnog.. Tried these flavors before and HATE all of them.  Seriously... 11 Gingerbread?? This is June...  Plus this is not a ""sample"" of Gingerbread... that's a box of it.  Coffee was only from Gloria Jean and Green Mountain, when I was supposed to get a ""sampler pack""?  Of 34 k-cups only 13 are what I call a variety (6 different flavors) so the rest is money down the drain.  Nothing like trying to pawn off last years bad flavors..."
"What I was expecting from this was 16-20 different types of coffee. What I got was 7 spicy eggnogs, 5 mudslides, 6 hazelnut and a lot of ""limited edition""  Christmas favors that I have seen on clearance many places for $5. I did not get what is expected and will not buy this ""company"" again. I read they fixed the variety grab bag problem 6 months ago. I assure you it was not fixed. It was nothing more than leftovers. I was very disappointed. DO NOT LET THE PICTURE FOOL YOU!"
Was misinformed...this is not going to be 24 different K-cups. We received 24 K-cups--most of which were the same flavors. Disappointed.
"They list 5 varieties of coffee. I received a ton of green mountain, no Wolfgang Puck, 2 Donut House and incredibly, 7 of the Gloria Jean Hazelnut, which is the very least favorite of all K-Cups for me... Exceptionally disappointed."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OAZ36I"">24 Count K-cup Flavored Coffee Sampler</a>I was surprised to see that the coffee came in a zip-lock plastic bag, which had me suspicious.  So I counted to make sure that it was all there.  Sure enough, it was one short.  Why are they not shipped is a sealed box like the regular coffee?  I just had to make sure they were not tampered with otherwise."
"I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider ""flavored"" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).<br /><br />So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!<br /><br />After re-reading the product description that says ""This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee."", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.<br /><br />JoAn"
"I was disappointed with the selection here - ""24 count"" sampler made me think I'd be getting 24 flavors to try.  Instead it was only around 9 or 10, with a few of each.  Seemed like someone just dumped them randomly in a box.  I didn't like most of these, and the donut house coffees of ""chocolate glazed donut"" and ""cinnamon roll"" didn't taste like they were named.  If you want to try out a bunch of different coffees, I wouldn't recommend this selection."
"Got this as a present for my in-laws as they're big coffee drinkers. They used to just get regular coffee because they didn't want to spend money on a flavor they may not like, now they have a chance to try different flavors without spending $18 for an entire box. Also arrived 2 days early"
"I got a pretty good selection in the box that I received...unlike others that have reviewed about theirs.<br /><br />Like others, the k-cups were just thrown in the box with only a small piece of cardboard in the there.<br /><br />The one thing that kills me is that printed on the box in bold letter is expires December 2011.  If I had known this before ordering, I probably wouldn't have gotten it. It's a little disappointing but I did get a good price on the k-cups.<br /><br />I've been able to get through quite a few of the flavors in there (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GAVAZY"">Wolfgang Puck Caramel Creme</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFKGM"">Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Vanilla Francaise</a> were quite delicious) but I feel like I'm rushing through the box to make sure I get through them all before the end of the month.<br /><br />It looks like Amazon is almost out of the boxes so hopefully if they restock this the expiration date won't be for sometime."
"The pack I got was great.  It had  a lot of different flavors: pumpkin spice,mudslide, butter toffe, French vanilla, Jamaica me crazy, Khalua, cinnamon roll, chocolate glazed donut, and hazelnut. Will definitely buy again!"
"I bought a Cuisinart K-cup brewer for my husband to save for his Christmas present. Unfortunately it came very quickly and the box was undisguised, arriving on one of the rare occasions when he was home and I was out! So we opened it very early and have been enjoying it for a couple of weeks. I also bought both Solofil and Ekobrew refillable cups, because  standard K-cups are both expensive and non-earth friendly. I still wanted to keep a few K-cups for emergencies and company, and was very saddened to find no real variety packs in the store. One of the Keurig ""variety"" packs has 4 blends inside, but they are all plain coffee, e.g. ""Sumatra"", ""Arabica"", etc, etc.<br /><br />My husband really hates flavored coffee, and I really love it, so this package was a godsend. Neither of us sweetens our coffee, so sticky-sweet creams are no good to us. Our order came in no time (sole complaint, the box was HUGE, the actual coffee package is about the size of the lunch bag)and the assortment is wonderful. I intended to save it for those special occasions or guests, but I don't think I have the willpower.<br /><br />One of the flavors was blueberry. I never would have been even tempted to purchase a blueberry-flavored coffee, but it was wonderful! I still have yet to try all the standard cinnamon, hazelnut and chocolate varieties I have, and I can only hope against hope that there is any left when-or-if company arrives!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TSHIOA"">Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers ,Two Pack</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a>"
"I was so thrilled when I came upon this in my search for a variety pack of K-Cups.  I was as many are when ordering stuff like this, slightly skeptical about the variety I would receive. I got a great assortment. I was very satisfied with my purchase and the quick delivery. Will definitely order from seller again.  In fact, I'm ordering more now!"
"The box arrived ahead of schedule (overnight!). I had the product mailed to my parents on the other side of the country as a surprise. In the first 5 hours they had tried four different flavors. They divided the cups up randomly and are now trading them--""I'll give you my blueberry for your cinnamon pastry.""<br /><br />My mother pointed out that these are better than having six flavors of creamer cluttering up the fridge that will expire before they're used up. The flavors were well-divided and intact when they arrived.<br /><br />I will use this company again."
"This pack is perfect! I just bought a new Keurig, but didn't want to buy a pack of just one flavor before I knew what I liked. I am tempted to just keep ordering this so I always have a variety. Don't worry about the k-cups being expired like in one previous review, all of the ones I received had expiration dates in 2012-13. Delish! Thanks for a great sampler!"
"I was excited when I recieved my mixed bag of coffees, pulling out many different and exciting flavors that I've never seen before like ""Cherry Chip Swirl"" or ""Wild Mountain Blueberry"". I really love the fact that you get different brands of k-cups and there was only 2 of each flavor, so I truly got an assortment rather than some of the other samplers out there that give you 4 or 8 or the same flavor. I'll surely be ordering again to see what exciting new flavors will be in my bag."
"12 of the 24 k-cups I received were hot cocoa. Not even coffee. Don't waste your money.  What I received looked like someone just stuck their hand into random boxes of k-cups, grabbed a handful, threw them into a paper bag, then shipped them out. Utter rip-off. This item should be removed from Amazon."
"Well, I ordered a sampler pack of flavored coffee. Out of 24, 12 were Grove Square Cappuccino mixes. I drink flavored coffee because I don't put Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), Sugar, Corn Syrup Solids, Instant Coffee, Sodium Caseinate, Salt, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Cocoa (processed with alkali), Dipotassium Phosphate, Cornstarch, Mono- and Diglycerides, Silicon Dioxide, Soy Lecithin, Artificial Color, Sucralose in my body willingly.<br /><br />CAPPUCCINO IS NOT COFFEE!!!<br /><br />That being said, I am left with 8 Hazelnuts (4 decaf) I didn't order a decaf sampler, 2 caramel vanilla, and 2 southern pecan.<br /><br />NOT HAPPY!<br />Onnalee, NY"
"This is one of the worst orders I have ever received from Amazon in regards to item description.  The order was supposed to be 24 flavored coffees, but what I received of the 24 were 8 hot chocolate Kcups and 4 flavored decaf.  Okay, so I can see adding some decaf ones, but do the math so far, that leaves 12 Kcups left.  Of the 12 left - 6 of them were the same flavored cappacino cups. What the heck?  I get 6 flavored coffees?  I won't order Kcups again from Amazon - I don't think they get it!"
"The description stated this was ""assorted flavored coffees.""  Included in the package was a large number of teas and hot chocolate.  If I had wanted teas or hot chocolate, I would have ordered them.  I wanted 24 coffees, and what I got was 16 usable coffees and 8 useless items that I did not order.  I was very disappointed.  The vendor would not respond to my feedback."
"I knew going into it by reading the description that there would be repeats, but this was RIDICULOUS.  Way too much of my order were holiday flavored K-Cups (gingerbread, pumpkin and egg nog).  I got 6 gingerbread, 6 pumpkin and 6 egg nog.  Really?  I suppose that would be fine were I ordering during the winter/holiday time, but not in the middle of the summer.  The rest were pretty repeated, as well.  I wish I had counted, but I didn't - I would estimate I only got 6 DIFFERENT samples.  It was pretty disappointing and I would never order again.  As far as it coming in a paper bag: yes, it does.  But who cares?"
I received 4 of these and they were simply an assortment of k-cups thrown into a brown paper lunch bag. This is particularly annoying for me as I use the k-cup rack which is specifically designed for the 24-count boxes.
"Although it was a nice sample, there were too many of certain flavors.<br />(Should be 2 or 3 of one flavor - not 6)<br />Would have liked a little more variety.  Shipping was fast.<br />Nice sample for the price!"
I love coffee & I love my Keurig coffee maker. What I don't love is when you order coffee and you are sent mostly tea & cappuccino. It would be ok if some tea was sent with the coffee but that was not the case. I will not be ordering this again; very disappointed in the selection I was sent.
"Disappointing. My Wife and I picked this up hoping to sample a variety of coffee with our new Keurig, and find the flavors we liked. Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called ""sampler"" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors."
"I have ordered MANY assortment packs. This was the absolute worst. It was basically a bunch (27) of Spicy Eggnog, Pumpkin Spice,  Island Coconut and Gingerbread. The ""assortment"" appears to be nothing more than an attempt to dump their ""Special Edition"" stock. Never again!"
"Ive been on amazon since 2007, and I've ordered over 500 items. This is the first review I've written. I read the reviews on this item and I figured the seller would learn to try to put many different sampler items in here. When I opened the package, there was only 28 total K-Cups, and 12 were the horrible pumpkin spice flavor I couldnt get rid of to save my life. EXTREMELY upset and I feel ripped off. Avoid this seller at all costs. Got a MUCH better deal at shoffee.com"
"Yes, the description says that some of flavors may be substituted without warning due to product availability. That being said, you are still led to believe that you'll be getting a wild assortment of 34 different flavors. Instead, I got 6 butter toffees (which I already knew I don't like), 5 pumpkin spice (which are just ok from past experience), and a bunch of other 5s and 4s. Only got maybe 2-3 unique flavors in the entire box. Otherwise, it was all repeats. The posting is totally misleading, so don't order from them if you actually think you're going to get a lot of different flavors and roasts to try. If this company were above-board, they'd fix this for their dissatisfied customers and do better in the future than just raiding and repackaging Costco boxes."
"The variety I got was good enough for me. It gave a nice blend of coffee tastes, which is what I was looking for. Yes, it comes in a box that looks like they were just tossed in, but nothing a wrong wth any of them. Great for those that want to try several different types."
"In a nutshell- save yourself the upset and buy your K-cup samplers from someone else. I read reviews before ordering so I expected to get a few duplicates, but WOW. Out of all the reviews I've read I think I've gotten the shortest stick so far. ALL of the coffees in the brown paper bag were from Green Mountain, ALL of them, and of those more than half were from the Christmas and Fall 2011 samplers. It's mid May 2012 and I just got sent an order filled with multiple pumpkin spice, spicy eggnog, gingerbread coffees, Really. They also all expire in the next 30 - 60 days, and even though I buy these for my office its a hard sell that any of these guys are going to want to drink ""spicy eggnog"" in June in Florida- so with that said more than half of these are going to wind up in the trash. Huge let down. Luckily there are other k-cup sellers I've bought from in the past that I have been satisfied with."
Mostly all of my coffees where Green mountian other than two. 7 of which where french vanilla. Could have just went to the store for the variety i got here!!!!!!!!!! Guess im just not a lucky coffee drinker.
"This was exactly what I wanted, a box full of various flavors of coffee. Mine had no repeats and a fabulous variety. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to have a variety of k-cups on hand - without having to commit to whole boxes!"
The coffee itself was good. There was an overabundant amount of Green Mountain coffee. I was hoping for more donut house or coffee people. The brown paper bags that it comes in isn't flattering but the coffee still tastes good.
"Of the 34 K-Cups, there was only 10 varieties.  We received about 6 of the same French Vanilla and Hazelnut.  Just like everyone said, order just thrown in a box."
"The selection of K-Cups was not as pictured.  Out of 34 cups, I received 13 vanilla and 6 hazelnut.  Only 4 cups were not a Green Mountain Coffee product.  I ordered the sampler pack specifically so that I could try different flavors from a variety of producers.  To say that I was dissapointed is an understatement.  Clearly this product was a collection of ""leftovers."" It come packaged in a stapled brown paper bag. Don't waste your time or money."
Sampler is just that--all sorts of different flavored coffee.  Wonderful idea to choose something different to try without purchasing an entire box.  We are enjoying our sampler and will purchase another surprise box soon.
"The photo shows only about 15 Green Mountain K-cups, so I was disappointed to see my package arrive with 29 Green Mountain coffees and only 5 from other companies.  Green Mountain makes an excellent product but this is far from a sampler pack as there are several repeats.  Last time purchasing from ""Deals on Call""."
"I was really looking forward to trying different brands and flavors of coffee but this assortment was 90% Green Mountain and 75% some type of vanilla.  It included 4 Blueberry (haven't tried that yet but not really happy about it).  I get the impression that you get about 4 or 5 of a good variety and then a handful each of whatever flavors don't sell very well.  Luckily I'm okay with all the vanilla but this definitely was not a ""variety"" pack."
"I Got my 24 pack it was in a perfect box, with 24 different flavor, quick delivery. I will be buying this assortment again."
Love this coffee pot and this was the easiest way to buy variety coffee. Excellent variety and all different flavors not sold anymore in stores :) Really loved the variety and shipping was fast and easy!
I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter who had received a Keurig brewer for Christmas. The cups arrived partially opened and with holes in them. She said about 50% of the cups were not usable. This was not a shipping problem but had to have come from the factory like that. She was disappointed and so was I.
"It is very disappointing for a caffeinated coffee drinker to receive decaf coffee when the website states that you will, in fact, receive CAFFEINATED varieties only.  I also received iced coffee (which was also not stated).  Your website needs to address this concern or you need to adjust your assortment to reflect this.  Other companies who mix K Cup assortments will do a caffeinated and decaf option, you should consider this and assure your customers are receiving what you are trying to sell.<br /><br />I did, although, receive only 1 of each flavor (which was very good in terms of variety).<br /><br />***UPDATE- I e-mailed Amazon customer service to let them know of the decaf issue and they were very quick to addressing my concerns.  Please post back if you receive decaf, as this was a very nice assortment otherwise and I would be interested in purchasing if they can address this problem***"
"I wish I would have read more of the reviews before I  ordered this ""sampler"".  I have had the same issue as many others: 1/4 of mine were all the same flavor, and two flavors weren't even on the list of POSSIBLES.  They were Eggnog and Gingerbread, CLEARLY leftover from the holiday season and who knows how old.  Like many others, I understand that you can't get one of everything...or could you????? Wouldn't it be wonderful if these were pre-packaged with DIFFERENT ones from the selections listed?"
"I recently purchased my first Keurig machine, the B60 model (which is wonderful, by the way), and my machine was one of those ""bonus packages"" that came with a small variety sampler pack (12 k-cups). Having gone through most of this fantastic assortment already, I decided to order a variety assortment from Amazon. I read all the reviews -- positive and negative -- and decided to take a chance on this one. It arrived today, and although there are some neat flavors that I am anxious to try, there is VERY LITTLE variety. I ordered the 24-count sampler. Out of these, 4 k-cups are truly unique/limited edition flavors that are not Green Mountain. That leaves 20 k-cups of Green Mountain that either French Vanilla (the majority), Caramel Vanilla Cream, Blueberry or Hazelnut. Luckily, these are at least flavors I like, they are just not all that unique. Probably won't order from these folks again, due to the lack of variety. I was really hoping for more choices, like the one that came with my Keurig (the sampler pack had 12 different coffees from all different coffee companies, some I hadn't heard of and were quite good). I hate to whine, but my morning cup is a very important part of my day! Too bad... if you like French Vanilla with a few surprises thrown in, then this assortment is for you, but not if you are looking for a true variety."
"Ordered the 34 count and it was Extremely disappointing.  I expected to get at least one-two of every flavor shown on the 34 count sampler.  I would say about 24 are either Hazelnut or Vanilla.  Which are last I need since I buy Hazelnut by the 80 pack carton at BJs.  No Mudslide, no Butter Toffee, No Donut House Cinnamon Roll, No Hawaiian, No Limited Edition. No Khalua, No Cappucino, No Timothy's coffee.  This is a farce and I am so disappointed in Amazon.  I have never had a problem before but this was really a ""bait and switch"" as far as I am concerned."
I am pleased with the mix of coffee in this pack. I will order this coffee sampler again when we need more!
each of these flavors were delicious the price was great too. would order again and again make a great cup of coffee.
"This item makes a wonderful gift, or just for yourself if you are looking to find some new and fun flavors for your coffee. The sampler is very neat in that it is just a random collection of flavors and you don't know what you are getting. Mine came in a small brown bag so I didnt think there was actually 24 in there, but there was! I would recommend this product to anyone!"
Perfect assortment of flavored coffee. I was able to try a variety of new flavors without having to commit to an entire box. Shipping was super fast and I will likely buy again.
"I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker. When I came across the ""flavored Coffee Sampler"" on the Amazon site, I thought it was a great way to try different brands/flavors without having to by a whole box. This was through ""Deals On Call LLC. I just received the ""Sampler."" I am very disappointed. Don't waste your money. I got multiples of the same brand/flavor.<br />It seems like they are just getting rid of the products that don't sell. I received 2 Spicy Eggnog - in February.<br />The  K-cups I received:<br />8 Donut House (5 Chocolate Glazed Donut, 3 Cinnamon Roll)<br />9 Gloria Jeans (3 flavors)<br />6 Green Mountain and 1 Timothy's<br />I did not receive ANY Van Houtte or Wolfgang Puck<br />If I wanted mostly Vanilla, I would have ordered it. I will not be using this site again."
"I like the price... but not the ""variety"" I got. I just got my Keurig and wanted to try a whole lot of coffees to see if there was a brand that I would like to buy in larger quantities. Unless I just LOVE Green Mountain coffee then this plan didn't quite work out. See my photo above for the actual 24 k-cups that I received. They were tossed into a brown paper bag and sealed with a sticker. They were placed into a cardboard box. None were damaged and it got here quickly."
"Orders have always arrived on time. I've ordered the 24-count ""variety pack"" a few times now. I was a bit suspect the first time when they arrived in a brown paper bag, stapled at the top, with a printed bar code on it. I don't know why, but that was more acceptable to me than the 1-gallon ziplock bag of K-cups I received this time - this time with only 23 K-cups in it, not the 24 I paid for. I suppose you could say that the ziplock will keep the coffee ""fresher"", but even the manufacturers ship K-cups in cardboard boxes since cups are already sealed. I realize this company/person probably purchased many individual flavors of coffee and is creating a hand-made mix of all of them to create the variety pack that doesn't really exist. But after this last purchase I think I'm done. I actually care less about receiving 23 instead of 24 cups, although nobody likes to get less than they paid for. It's the minimalist packaging and ""made in my basement"" look of the packaging that has done it for me."
"I ordered this hoping to have diff flavors of coffee for our office, needless to say I get 2 French Vanilla and 2 Hazelnut and the rest of them are decaf and bold blends.<br /><br />Really bold blends?  If I wanted bold I can buy that at the grocery store I wanted the flavored coffee's so from now on I will buy them on ebay where I do get the 24 different flavors of coffee.<br /><br />This was a epic fail order :(  Normally I never have anything bad to say about Amazon and some of their shippers but this one well it hit bottom."
"I love the idea of being able to buy different flavors from different companies.  However, this mix was more expensive than those purchased with bed bath and beyond coupon and my box included a lot of holiday flavors which are on sale now anyway.  I would not have purchased the mix if I knew they were included as I could have bought a sampler box of these flavors from my local store.  I hope the company adds more variety without using sampler mixes."
these are okay if you like really sweet flavors.  i usually get the box of 50 for the same price.  i will probably do that next time.
In the 24 pack I only received 2 of the brands listed. 21 were Green Mountain and 3 Gloria Jeans. I must say they aren't flavors I would want to try.
"I found this product at a little tiny store. I bought it figuring what the heck. My hair is damaged and a little bit fried. this product gave me shine, it calmed most of my frizzies, and a wonderful subtle scent to go with it. i love this product...the only down side is its a little bit hard to find."
Love how my hair responds and love the scent.  I know I can always count on Nature's Gate for great products.
"I have curly hair and it calms the frizz.  I wish I could still find it in the store but on line is better than not at all!  The scent is subtle and something I can handle since I have trouble with a lot of the ""perfume"" type scents in other brands."
The Chocolate Glaze Pop has a good flavor! It was very easy to use. We also bought the caramel flavoring. We like the caramel flavoring better. Shipped on time.
"If you like the taste of whiskey, you'll like this sauce.  I don't use this sauce everyday, but the mood seems to hit me about once a week."
"One of my favorite teas from Teavana. It's smooth and fruity, NATURALLY sweet, and just enough flavor in every cup. HIGHLY recommend"
"I just spent a small fortune on four different types of this tea. Along with the pitcher and tins. I just went on Amazon and saw that it was a fraction of the cost I paid for. But I must say this tea is outstanding, in taste and a little goes a long way. I will most definitely purchase it through Amazon and not at the actual store. Wish I had done some research before spending lots of money on these products."
"This is one of my husband's favorite teas.  I wish it weren't so expensive, but it does last a long time.  I bought an 8 ounce bag and received 4 separate 2 ounce bags, which is quite a waste of packaging."
My entire family loved these petit fours. They didn't last long here. We had a hard time keeping everyone out of them so they could last.
"I just received these today.  It's a good thing that I ordered them for a casual family party, because there is no way that I would put these out for anything important.<br /><br />They don't taste bad, but they don't look so good.  About 75% of them are not fully covered with outside coating, and they are all different sizes.  Some are 1 layer, some are 2 or 3, and some are 4.  If I can figure out how to post pictures, I will.<br /><br />All of the petit fours with white coating taste the same.  All of the chocolate ones taste the same, too, but slightly different from the white ones."
A friend turned me on to this wonderful tea. Has a very rich flavor and I only need one bag for a 16 ounce mug.
"Typhoo is an excellent tea and I highly recommend it. The problem was in the shipping. This dealer shipped the tea without a corrugated box, so the tea box was crushed on arrival. I got what I paid for. Because I now had no box to hold my Typhoo, I transferred the tea bags to a zip-loc bag to maintain freshness, but it would have been nice to have a tea box that was not destroyed."
"If you ate only soft food, your teeth would eventually fall out. True story. If you eat these, you may compress your fillings if you are older, but your teeth will never fall out, and your taste buds will bless you forever! Fabulous snack!"
"If you are looking for crunchy spicy snack, look no more. This is the best in the corn nuts family. And the best salty ,spicy , crunchy snack. Love it."
"This is a product where you can actually taste the ingridients that are supposed to be in here. The lime and chili flavor are very prominent, but not overpowering. The chili adds just enough kick without being too spicy.<br /><br />Best flavor to be released yet."
move over chili cheese frito's because these corn nuts just knocked you out with flavor.
"I bought these and they are worth buying, especially when the only place most people can get them is in the Gas Stations anyways, and this size pack would be about 4 or 5 dollars each.  The only thing that was wrong is my package was 2 bags short, so I called the 800 number and they sent me the replacement within a few days without hesitation."
"What else is there to say?  They are crunchy and full of flavor.  The biggest issue I have is that.... once I open the bag, I tend to eat the whole thing!  I suppose there are worse things to eat...  ;)"
"I fell in love with these as a child. Always stop at the local Golden Pantry to grab some but saw them in bulk on Amazon. No thinker here, got two flavors. Warning -Your fingers will get deliciously messy."
Living abroad sometimes one just wants a PB&J! Perfect find along with the Honey roasted Peanut Butter!!! (i have to write two more words)
"IBC Sugar Free Root Beer Barrels are very good tasting hard candies. These are sweetended with sucralose (Splenda), and taste very close to regular root beer barrel candy.<br /><br />You do have to be aware that a serving size of 2 pieces still have 40 calories, but the good news for us diabetis is that they have 0 net carbs.<br /><br />Recommended!"
"I love this stuff.  A friend brought me some from Mexico, and I haven't been able to find it in any stores around here (Dallas) so I just ordered some from Amazon.  I love it.  All the different miche mix's are delicious.  I use it in cold Dos XX or Coronita's."
"If you like vanilla, you will enjoy the taste of this mixture. I don't put sugar in my coffee, but I gave this a try and it was delicious. I'm sure it will taste great in hot chocolate and sprinkled on cupcakes."
My brother-in-law loves various hot sauces so I thought I'd get the Ass Blaster Hot Sauce.  He absolutely loved it! The funny Outhouse packaging made it a GREAT gift.
"These are light and crispy and tart but sweet.  We originally ordered them in a fundraising catalog, and when they were gone, I had to hunt them down on the web.  My husband LOVES them and I order them special for him.  I have yet to find a Key Lime cookie that compares.  I'm a chocolate chip cookie gal, yet I really like these.  They are also dainty enough to impress friends when you serve them at luncheons or get-togethers.  I have tried all the flavors, and key lime is the best (although they are all good)."
"These are wonderful little treats, elegantly packed. A treat has to be good, satisfying with 1 or 2 bites, and worth every calorie.  These certainly are!  Crispy, light and sweet-hope Amazon carries these always. The lime essence is in the powdered sugar, so be sure to enjoy that with the cookies.<br /><br />A collection of 6 nicely packed boxes  enables you to give a nice box to a deserving friend. And these certainly are appreciated!<br /><br />Note: freshness is not an issue."
Not the same drops from Flathau that I remember. The ones I was expecting had powdered sugar. I was disappointed.
"These lemon snaps are some of the best cookies I've ever eaten.  They taste better than home-made, with a hint of cracked lemon candy inside each cookie.  I would serve them at one of my finest dinner parties."
"These are great!  They taste very fresh and have the perfect bite of lime flavor with plenty of powdered sugar.  The packaging is very nice, which made these great gifts for our clients.  The boxes weren't packed very well for shipping to Amazon, so two of six had damaged corners, but the others were in good condition (original shipping boxes inside Amazon's shipping box)."
Haven't gotten my shipment yet from Amazon but I've gotten these at TJ Max in the past and they are wonderul.  Sweet and soft.  The Key Lime ones are also fabulous!
When I received these key lime snaps I noticed they were ready to expire.  There is no way we can eat 6 boxes of these in 2 weeks.  They are very good and have a great taste.  I am very upset about this product.  I have never had a problem with any products I have bought on Amazon.  I hope Amazon does something about this. A very upset and disappointed customer.
"I was very disappointed with the bonsai from Brussel""s.  I ordered the plant as a gift for my niece who was opening a new office.  She said that the plant was delivered to her in a very ""sick"" state.  I immediately contacted Amazon to see what I could do to get my niece a new plant.  They were very helpful and detailed in telling me what I needed to do to receive a replacement.  Unfortunately, when the replacement plant arrived, my niece said that it was in worse shape than the first one!!!!  She said that there were three leaves that were yellow; one was about to fall off.  She tried to nurse it back to health, however, after she told me the condition it was in, I immediately contacted Amazon for a refund.  Why spend money to buy a sick plant!!!"
"Save your $ or buy from a different distributor- returning the dead plant is an inconvenience!  If you do invest $30 in this plant, smell the roots when you open it.  If you smell rot call right away as it will be dead in a week.  Also look for yellow striations or yellow stalks- same issue."
"I ordered the 7 stalk curly bamboo arrangement as a get well present for my father in the hospital. I am very disapointed in this product. It didnt look anything like the picutre! It was considerably smaller than what is pictured and the bamboo stalks were misshapen and yellowed. The Stalks are all clumped together and lean heavy to one side. The roots (what little roots there were)were bound so tightly i had to soak away wet paper(that looked like wet toilet paper) that they used to keep the roots moist. I doubt the poor little thing will live. It was packed in packing peanuts but shifted during transit and crushed all of the leaves on one side, even ripped a few off. The two pieces of curly bamboo look terrible, and are intertwined so tightly with each other it just looks like one stalk. This looks nothing like what i expected from the picture. I paid 30 bucks for this! what a waste."
"I wanted to make a playable Angry Birds cake for my son's birthday.  After hours of surfing the net to find figurines, not finding them, and then surfing for fondant to make them myself, I decided to try fondarific and couldn't have been happier with my choice.  Here is my review of the product after making the figurines.  (I posted pictures of them as a customer image so you could see the results.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />* This stuff tastes great!  The vanilla tastes like a homemade marshmallow fondant (you can find recipes on the web) but is much easier to work with.  I also bought some of the Melon flavor to make the pigs and it tastes just like honeydew melons, well, just like a honeydew flavored Jelly Belly would taste.<br />* Amazingly easy to work with.  It is hard out of the tub, so I used a semi-sharp knife to cut off a chunk.  Then just fold and squish a few times and it is as pliable as fresh Playdough.  If it gets to soft, just stick it in the fridge for a while to harden.<br />* Takes color well.  I used Ateco gel food colors, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1C6"">Ateco 1112 12-Color Food Coloring Kit</a>, and got great results, even with the black.<br />* Holds its shape.  I wanted to be sure I could pull this off, so I made one pig three weeks ago.  Then I let it just sit there for three weeks.  It still looked great.  Held its color and shape and even stayed glossy.  I would have included a picture of it, buy my 1-year-old found it on the counter and smushed it today.<br />* Doesn't go bad.  Three weeks sitting out and I could still reshape and use fondarific (not that I'd eat it after letting it sit out in the open for that long).  When the company says it's good for a year after purchase, I believe it.  I had a bunch left over.  I'll probably end up using it on next year's birthday cake.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Fondarific will not harden if you leave it out to dry.  You have to add tylose powder to get hard figurines.  I didn't add tylose because, well, they are angry birds.  I figured I was better of if they stayed a little soft since there is a high likely-hood my son's will end up throwing these birds at each other, or at me. :)<br />* Fondarific is a bit pricier than making it yourself...but not much.  By the time you've purchased a pound of marshmallows, two pounds of powdered sugar, and some shortening, I think the added expense for fondarific is worth it.  I know, this is supposed to be a con. I'll admit I'm biased at this point.<br /><br />Note:<br />Not that anyone would think it, but I'm not a professional cake decorator or figurine maker.  The angry birds figurines I made were my FIRST attempt at making fondant figurines.  I did watch some instructional videos on the web, but it's essentially like sculpturing with Play Dough.  I did try to make marshmallow fondant for last years birthday cake, and I would never have been able to make figurines out of that stuff.<br /><br />So, there you have it, my honest opinion of fondarific.  I would definitely purchase this again (not that I plan on making another Angry Birds cake any time soon)."
"this is my first time working with fondant and it was easy!! its very yummy, im not a big fan on fondant on cakes because its always thick and chewy so i tried making thinner layers and worked great and tasted even better!! i colored the fondant different colors with gel food coloring and it held it perfectly! made my tie-dye cake look amazing!!! i got this brand because everyone i asked about it, uses it due to the fact on how easy it is to work with and how yummy it is compared to other brands! BUY THIS!!"
"This was a great product and easy to use, I am now to fonadant decorating and it was tricky to learn how to get it on the cake, but after the second attempt I got it and it was amazing and it did have a nice sweet taste and was easy enough for a beginner to use. Everyone loved the cake that I made."
I bought this fondant because the previous buyers gave good reviews. I have worked with fondant before and I have never had trouble putting in on the cake. The fondant was not manageable. When i finally got it on top  of the cake it would start stretching from the sides. When I tried to make figurines out of it and it would just fall apart.
"It was really hard to work with, but maybe it was my inexperience with fondant! I also bought the cherry red which the flavor was considerably worst but still not bad."
"As stated in a previous review for this same product but in black this was my first time using fondant. This product was use for my oldest grandaughter and her friend who share a birthday. They turned 16 and planned a large party 125+ friends invited. I made two full sheet cakes using this product in black and white. I was pleased with the results, this product was easy to work with, and the price was great. Definately a worthwile purchase."
"Fondarific is by far the best tasting and easiest to work with fondant out there. Somewhat expensive unless you can find a deal on Amazon (occasionally I have gotten a pretty decent price that way). Well worth it though to not deal with the headache of dry cracking fondant that you have to be a lumberjack to roll out. The color is slightly off white but unless it is sitting next to something stark white nobody will be able to tell it isn't the wedding white, which is frequently out of stock on this site."
"I tried Fondarific because the reviews all seemed pretty good - i.e. SUPPPOSEDLY tastes good, easy to work with, doesn't dry out, etc.<br /><br />1. I use a Sweetwise mat to roll out my fondant in most cases. Fondarific stuck to the mat. We're talking disaster. Thankfully I was able to repair the bulk of the problems (and there were TONS of them)with shortening. Either way, the finish wasn't as clean as I would have liked...something that's NEVER been a problem with Satin Ice, Chocopan or my MMF.<br />2. I was expecting awesome taste, but this tasted like wax, Wilton, and Chocopan mixed together. Thankfully the slight Chocopan taste saved it taste wise, but this stuff doesn't hold a candle to Satin Ice in the taste department. My kids, who like MMF and Satin Ice, HATE - and I mean HATED - Fondarific.<br />3. I had some smaller accents to cover, so I rolled out the Fondarific in the traditional way...i.e. no mat. The stuff was sooooooo sticky and by the time I got enough powdered sugar down to keep this stuff from sticking- it was dried out to the point where it was almost useless. Sure, there was no elephant skin, but it felt more like gumpaste that had started to harden.<br />4. The texture after being rolled onto the cake was off. I always hear about people saying they don't like how fondant feels in their mouth, but my MMF and Satin Ice had changed my friends' and family members' opinions. Sadly- Fondarific even had me gagging and peeling the fondant off my slice.<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I will NEVER use this again. Thankfully I was able to save the cake and it still came out looking good, but it was a struggle every step of the way."
"My favorite, of course, is CHOCOLATE!  All three flavors; i.e.. Chocolate, Strawberry, and Vanilla are delicious mixed either with COLD water or SKIM MILK (only 8 oz) ... I usually drink mine for breakfast which will tie you over until lunchtime! The reason it's called ""CONTROL SHAKE"" in the first place is because it does help to CONTROL your cravings for anything sweet and delicious; because in itself, it is sweet, delicious, and creamy!! YUM!! There are five packets in each box.  Control Shake also allows you to have a quick lunch if needed.  This product has 24 minerals and vitamins. You can also mix Control Shake in your blender with ice, which makes it really frothy ... try Control Shake, you will absolutely LOVE the taste!"
"This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
"after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be ""ginseng for women"" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to ""draw one's energy"" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's ""good for you"" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?"
"My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from ""crisp and delicious"" to ""overpowering and slightly off-putting"". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere."
This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
Purchased this tea because of recommendation. Product arrived well packaged and quickly. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.
I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it...
I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.
The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
You get enough in each package to make a good size cup of drink.  It is consistent in its flavor and the amount you get in each packet.  I have purchased it a couple of times.
If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.
"Gold Prince has made a terrible mistake.  There are two products.  COLDAID and FLUAID.  THey are different formulary.  Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.  If you want FLUAID, which is the superior product, don't buy it from AMAZON or off of the sellers website.  It is a mistake.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P936UK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.
I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
Very good flavor.  Lots of Moringa benefits and soothing Lemon.  Feel healthy and relaxed after drinking this tea. I can do all my activities without getting tiredness.  I like the combination of Moringa and Lemon and tea in this...very nice.
"This Organic Moringa Lemon tea is very good, tasty and refreshing.  Gives me the benefits of Moringa and lemongrass, easy way to acquire daily needed nutrition and vitamins.  This tea keeps me energetic and active, I also like the canister container that helps me to store for long time and carry anywhere. Thanks."
This is a great french syrup. You just need few drops to prepare a great a refreshing drink for kids. You can also use it for cocktails.
"I had never liked the taste of coffee. I thought the smell was nice, but the taste seemed far removed from that aroma. Then, I went to Italy and, being the (American) tourist that I was, I had to try every food and drink my teenaged hands could reach. In a tiny cafe in Assisi, I had my first shot of espresso. It was dark, strong, and bitter in a peculiarly pleasant way. Since then, I have been trying to recreate that taste and this is the closest I have come to it with a grad student-type budget and local equipment. Thank you!<br /><br />Now please, Zicaffe', if you would, offer this in larger quantities as you do your other espresso pods, I would greatly appreciate it."
"I bought the Blueberry Walnut along with the Honey Almond. Both are good, and shipping was fast; those are what the two stars are for. The others are empty because this was advertised as a pack of 30, and in reality it is a pack of 6! I contacted the seller, and they defended themselves stating that there are indeed 30 pouches. 30 1.5 oz packages that is, not 30 packs of 5, which they seem to be advertising in their title.<br /><br />""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" Just makes me sick that I paid so much for these."
I am diabetic and absolutely loved these jellies.  No aftertaste.  Will definitely buy again.  I loved the chocolate coating and sometimes ate the choclate first. LOL
This is the best hard candy.  I bought 5 pounds of it and have to order more.  These are perfectly flavored and are enjoyable to eat.  The ordering process was easy and the delivery was fast.  I will be ordering these again just as soon as I finish this review.
Since the product hasnt been delivered I cant review it.  The only thing I am not happy about is the delivery charge was more than the product.
"I use a lot of granulated garlic in my cooking.  This may have been a bit much, but the price was awesome.  My local grocery store in Kansas City, MO charges over $6 for 12 ounces.  In Florida I could buy Granulated garlic for under $6 per pound and on sale for $4.  But I can't find it cheap outside of Florida and Texas.  It is alot of garlic, worth the money if use garlic. I use garlic in 80% of my receipes.  This should last me about 2 years, I just hope the taste holds up.  I store it in airtight bag in the fridge, so it should be fine.  But be warned it is a lot of garlic."
"The bottle isn't sealed, like with vitamins or like SPICES should be!! You know, you take the screw lid off and THEN need to perforate and peel off the seal. WTH"
"I use alot of this product, I'm thankful not to have to purchase lots of small containers.  That is too much wasteful plastic."
"I was very happy to see that I could order just the blueberry tea like the tin that came with my iced tea maker, it's the first blueberry tea I've tried and I love it. I ordered the 4 pack tins and I will for sure order it again!!"
Finally the first reseller in UNITED STATES.<br />My son keep eating it!<br /><br />Only one thing that I noticed is the missing expiration date on the package which should be VISIBLE and READABLE.
"Easy to chew, easy to mix, low on calories, high on vitamins and tastes great!"
My 11 month old daughter loves these! We give them to her at the end of every meal for a delicious and nutritious dessert.  They're a great alternative to Gerber's Biter Biscuits.
"When you are a grown up, you want your kids to experience the good things that you had in your childhood. This is one of them: Biscotti Plasmon! At 43 I still remember the commercials... Now that i'm a father myself and living in the USA I searched and searched to find them for my daughter. She, now 13 months old, will not drink her milk without at least one biscotto Plasmon in it. I love it.<br /><br />Excellent product,<br />Andrea Paesano"
"I have been purchasing this product for years. From 2 months to 90 years old, everyone can benefit from these cookies. For all of my children (I have 3) I have put one cookie in at least 2 of their bottles a day. They love them."
I buy these for my baby (17months). you can melt them in a bottle of milk. good product.
The bat gift was not as nice as I'd thought it would be but the other basket was nice.  My grandson will be disappointed
"I moved to Missouri from Las Vegas, where I was used to buying these fabulous chips in every grocery store.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered they're not offered in Missouri, nor can groceries here order them from Lay's (so they say).  I ordered some online from the Mexican Grocer, but since the packages of chips were just thrown into a box without packing or dividers, I received crumbs.  Tasty crumbs, but crumbs, nonetheless.  I know that Amazon would pack them to ship correctly, so please, please, please, Amazon, won't you please talk Lay's into letting you offer these through the Internet?  Please?"
"I went to the west coast and fell in love with these Limon chips!  They are the best chip I've ever tasted and addictive.  Of course  when I got back to the south, they were nowhere to be found.  Everyone needs to write Lays Co. and ask them to do another survey in the south for these chips.  It's been since 2000 and people's taste have changed since then.  I'll definitely buy a case if I can find them."
I'm from the west coast but am now stationed on the east coast and deployed overseas.  I was hoping Amazon would be able to come through for me on these fabulous chips!!!  They are definately my favorite but so hard to find.... I've even went to the Lay's website for assistance but no love so far :-(
The Lays Limon chips are the best I have tasted yet.  The Dill Pickle even falls shy to the emmense Lime taste.  Its a fresh and satisfying new combination that will leave you wanting more.  Just as addictive as the Salt and Vinegar chips  but better!
"Had these chips in Yuma, AZ while on a run to Mexico.  They are wonderful.  The flavor is perfect and the best I've had of all flavored chips --  better than vinegar-flavored chips, etc.  Even the people I was with, who cringed when I bought them, ate so many I had to buy more.  Tried to find them in Phoenix grocery stores and they weren't readily available - it's a flavor tailored to the Hispanic palate, hopefully it will catch on soon.  Please Amazon, try to get these soon."
"This must have been the worst chips, I ever ate in my life. I saw the reviews and i thought humm should I buy it. I went to a mexican store and bought one. Went home and ate it then after 2 chips, I threw them in the trash."
horrible! do not get! the suction cup will not stay in place it dropped my iphone twice when the car wasn't even moving
"I live in the NW and consider myself a smoked salmon enthusiast.  This is right up there with the best of the best I've had right from Pike Place market.  It's very moist, fresh, and has no strange preservative aftertaste.  Plus you get two packages which is great for gift giving... one for me, one for you.  I highly recommend this salmon, you will not regret it!"
"I ordered this as a birthday gift for a relative who used to live in Alaska.  My order arrived ahead of schedule, safely packed in an attractive box.  We all agreed that the salmon has a good flavor and texture.  Oh, and for those who are concerned that the expiration date isn't listed here on Amazon, my box had an expiration date in 2017."
"Got the salmon, it tastes good but I thought I was buying a cold smoked salmon.<br />At least specify when you sell a smoked salmon if its cooked or cold smoked<br />there is a BIG diference."
"If you like smoked fish as I do , this is for you, Nicely packaged and well handled and of course fine eaten. Made it into a nice fish dip for some company and it went over like a fat dude at a pie eaten contest. They loved it, so much so I only got a small taste. I fooled them though. I hid a whole package for myself. My moma raised a bunch of slow kids, I was not one of them (;. Oh my , I was so glad I did, great flavor, firm meat and did not last long even with just me and my lady friend. Its a nice and different taste treat. All I can really say is 'It taste like more "". Try it , you'll like it!!!"
We received rave reviews from our many Easter lakeside breakfast guests. The salmon was the center point of our event.
"Maybe I was spoiled by spending so much time in Alaska, but this salmon was inedible.  It did not smell appealing when opened, and the taste was metallic and overly salted.  I wound up having to trash the whole thing.  It had not expired, and the packaging was not damaged so I have to believe it was just this particular brand.  It was a major disappointment."
"This is my second round of buying these on amazon.  I cannot seem to find them anywhere else in stores, and when I do they are ~$3.00 a bag.  The price on these is good, and the product is superb.  I hope this is a long term flavor move, and not a passing fancy."
"This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product. Carbohydrates are carbohydrates are carbohydrates. No cat needs them. Ever! Apparently the grains used in this product are local to Indiana and surrounding areas (Michigan, Illinois, Ohio)? That's never a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. I've also read the company is non-GMO but I haven't confirmed that information through e-mail. The point is that unless your pet is allergic to corn or rice you're wasting your time going grain free. Potatoes and peas are just as useless as corn or rice and cats would never eat any of these in the wild. So if you want a food that is locally sourced (for the most part) and don't want to pay twice as much for Orijen simply because they use peas and potatoes this is a great option."
"Bought this on a whim! It was on sale and I had no expectations. How bad can dried mango be, right? Wrong! The appearance of the product is extremely unappetizing - little black uneven lumps with sprinkling of salt on the dried mangos. In my opinion, the taste is salty, gummy and disgusting. I have eaten many dried/cured mangos before and this is the worst ever. This whole lot is going into the trash!"
This espresso coffee was just what I was looking for....and at a great price! I use it in baking and it adds just the right amount of coffee flavor. I would definetly buy it again!
"Best tasting instant coffee I've ever tried. It has a decent amount of caffeine also. I keep a bottle at home, at work, and in my car. Dissolves very easily, even in cold soy milk."
Medaglia D'Oro is the best instant espresso coffee I have ever had.  I carry a jar around with me when I travel and add it to most of the cups of coffee I get along the road.  I love coffee and this is by far the boldest yet smoothest espresso I have found.
"I needed instant espresso to cook with.  Does a great job. Have nothing to compare it too, but I have seen cooking shows using this brand."
"I didn't see much use for the, admittedly cute, white bathtub shaped basket. Until my mother suggested I use it in my bathroom to keep my small counter from being overly cluttered. She was right. It was perfect! The products were lovely to use and didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I had just discovered I was allergic to the lavender products sold by the same company. But it turns out it was the lavender, not the product."
"Received this as a gift. It is so cheap and tacky looking that I was curious how much someone spent on what I could have picked up at the Dollar Store for under 10 bucks. The lotions and bath salts, etcetera are disgustingly low quality, I would never even consider using them. The wire basket that it's all packed in is laughable unless of course you like chicken wire shaped as a sleigh, but I think it's suppose to be a tub. Absolutely the worst gift I have ever received. Funny though. Save your money."
I have ordered from Omaha Steaks for several years now and I have nothing but PRAISE for this company.<br />We only had a problem 1 time and they let us keep the extra order! I've never heard of that.<br />They are a Great company and we will continue to order from them regularly.<br /><br />A PLUS A PLUS A PLUS A PLUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Mike & Linda
"I gave these to my husband for Christmas, and we had them over the holidays.  They were sooo tender and juicy!  They arrive so quickly. I am always thrilled with Omaha steaks.  Thanks for such a wonderful product!"
"Thought we had good steaks where I live, but these are superior. Would definitely buy them again, well-packaged, great tasting product, exactly what I thought I would get, I did get...this company is famous for a reason."
"This pasta is really delicious, as well as being considerably lower in calories than regular pasta, and having 18g fiber per serving. I agree that it is a bit blander tasting that regular pasta, but I actually like that: since it doesn't overwhelm the sauce you are using (the way whole wheat pastas tend to do), it allows the sauce to be the star of your dish. A 2-ounce portion is very satisfying. The sampler is a nice way to try it out. Mine came with 2 boxes each of penne, rotini, and linguine. Will definitely recommend it friends!"
Not sure how to review the pasta as I order for my wife and son's and every time I try to cook some it is normally gone. I got it originally becuase my wife is on Weight Watchers and my son's were interested in the hight fiber. So far from the leftovers they have left me the pasta is very tastful. We have gotten the sampler but will buy something different next time and I'll have it delivered at work instead of home and maybe I will be able to try it.
"I am so happy with this pasta... so is my family.  I make it all the time.  I make a light alfredo sauce, marinara, olive oil & parmesan cheese - the options are endless.  We are pasta lovers and it tastes great.  I would love Fiber Gourmet to come out with a lasagna noodle..."
"A few years ago I ordered the ""nests"" in various flavors and I thought it was pretty good with the exception of the spinach.  I recently ordered this sampler and I must say the pasta is vastly improved in texture and in taste.  Although it's pricey, I will continue to order the FiberGourmet because we eat a lot of pasta in our house and even my 14 year old daughter likes it!<br /><br />I ordered the lasagna noodles and I look forward to attempting a lowfat meal with them."
Not only is this pasta high fiber and low calorie but surprisingly it tastes good too!!! I've had all that whole wheat pasta which isn't as healthy and tastes bad...Now I would never go back to it! My whole family is extremely satisfied with this pasta and we eat it almost everyday! VERY HAPPY!
"I don't eat a lot of pasta because the calories seem so ""empty,"" but I was attracted to the huge amount of fiber in these products.  Whole wheat pasta sometimes has a slight bitter taste that this pasta does not have.  (I seldom eat white flour.) This is very tasty and passes muster just fine with picky eaters.  One caveat:  The directions for cooking time are way off.  You will have to experiment.  Doubling the time is not out of the question."
"I tried the Fiber Gourmet Light Pasta Mini Sampler, not knowing what to expect. I had tried light pastas in the past but always had been disappointed. My maiden name is ""Marzilli"" and I'm all Italian. So I'm very fussy about the taste and texture of my pasta! Well was I ever thrilled with this product! My husband and I loved it!<br />I tried it traditionally,with meatballs and red sauce, and cold in many variations of Pasta Salad. It was delicious! It was hard to believe I was eating healthy and light. The eight ounce size was perfect for the two of us, with just enough for leftovers.<br />I have ordered and reordered the Spaghetti and Rotini. It's the only pasta I will use!<br />Joyce Shallcross"
"While the service from the vendor was great (no complaints there), I have to admit that the pasta is not so great. It took far, far longer to cook, even 'al dente', than described on the package. And, even for fiber, the taste was a bit stiff. So I will probably be ordering more, but only for my super-health-conscious daughter."
"ORDERED THIS WITH SOME TREPIDATION AND HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DELIGHTED, THIS FIBER GOURMET PASTA COOKS UP NICELY AL DENTE AND HAS VERY GOOD TEXTURE AND MOUTH FEEL....MY HUSBAND IS VERY FUSSY ABOUT HIS PASTA, CANNOT STAND MUSHY OR SOFT PASTA AND THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!!!"
I love this product and can't find it in local stores.  Im thrilled I can order it on line and have nothing but good stuff to say about it.
"FIBER GOURMET LITE PASTA IS A LIFE SAVER, I USE THE PASTA ALL THE TIME, IT TASTE GREAT AND YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT IT IS HIGH FIBER. I WILL ORDER ALL THE TIME FROM NOW ON. THE SAMPLER PACK OF 6 IS THE WAY TO GO, IF YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED IT. THAT IS HOW I GOT STARTED[[ASIN:B001J5WTC2 FiberGourmet Light Pasta Mini Sampler, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)"
This is for those who love pasta--it's delicious & is loaded with fiber & less calories. Pairs well with any sauce.
"This stuff is just that- unbelievable! It tastes so good!!! Just like the real thing, and you can eat double the amount of pasta for the same calories! You're probably nervous that it tastes all chalky, but it really doesn't. Highly reccommend to anyone- even if you're not  on a diet- you should be replacing your regular pasta with this, just swap it in for your health and your kids- they won't know the difference!"
"I can't speak to the health benefits of this product because I have only tried it a few times. I bought the sampler and I've tried them all- it really does taste good, just like ""regular"" pasta. It's really very tasty and honestly, if you didn't tell me it was ""special"" pasta I wouldn't think it was anything different.<br /><br />Don't know that the added fiber fills you up any more of cuts down on the amount you eat but it's a very tasty pasta that's lower in calories and carbs and higher in fiber than most other pastas so I guess it's a win."
"While I do like this pasta, there are a few caveats. First of all, it has to be cooked longer than regular pasta to get it to the proper stage of doneness. It will taste starchy if not cooked long enough. Also, the box of spaghetti looks like a regular 16-oz box of spaghetti, but I was disappointed to find it is only half full.  I don't like the high price, but I will continue to buy it because it is healthy and tastes great."
"I thought this was a really nice tasting pasta.  It was fun to experiment with different varieties to see which one tasted best.  If you are looking to experiment then this is a good value.  I think it would also make a nice gift.  It is comparable to barilla quality, but maybe even a little better.  The high fiber content is nice too."
"If you're hungry, want quantity without calories and fat, this product is for you.  Try it, you'll be hooked."
"I don't know if they changed the recipe for the better of if the new shapes I tried (this one and the lasagna) simply work better, but man, these are great.<br /><br />In the earlier days of FiberGourmet, I had tried the fettucine nests (regular and two flavored types) and really, they were just okay. The fiber was nice, the firmer texture is nice (I'm an al dente fan and hate mushy pasta), but it had a sort of grittiness and blandness that was only tolerable under lots of sauce and cheese.<br /><br />But since I have been trying to increase my hubby's fiber intake (and I prefer high-fiber pasta for myself), I decided a couple months ago to try a few new things from FG: the cheese crackers, the rotini, the lasagna.<br /><br />I tried the lasagna first and it came out terrific. I needed a box and a half for my normal lasagna size, but the texture was beautiful and held up under microwaving as leftovers.<br /><br />The cheese crackers will be a staple for me. Amazing crunch and very like Cheez-Its (a bit more tangy or bitter, but with a better crunch and superb fiber count).<br /><br />The rotini is one I need to reorder, as I've gone through the 6 boxes already. It has paired beautifully with marinara and with lite alfredo sauce, and it was excellent in an improvised supper of the rotini with artichoke hearts, garlic, EVOO, spinach, and parmesan.<br /><br />The spaghetti stays very firm, which takes a tad bit of getting used to for me, but hubby liked the texture. Went just fine with marinara and meatballs and even better for me as leftover, as it didn't get mushy at all and had nice ""tooth feel"". I made it with oil and garlic and hot pepper flakes it was delish. I also had it with vegan sloppy joe (textured soy) , cheddar, and tomato bits and it was very good.<br /><br />I do find I get quite a bit of gas when I have a generous serving, so I only eat it when I know I don't have to be out and about. :)  But that's a minor issue for me, as the high fiber and excellent firm texture and improved (imo) flavor from the original pasta they had.<br /><br />The price is a bit mad. One package of the spaghetti, for instance, is very slight. Only half pound (for those used to full pound spaghetti boxes). So, I used both boxes so I'd have leftovers for a couple days for me and hubby. Somehow, I don't understand why the equivalent size to a standard spaghetti box has to be like five to six times as much (since I can get a box of spaghetti of decent to good quality locally for a buck to a bit more). These, at this amazon price of 18 bucks for six samplers, means each box averages 3 bucks. Two boxes of spaghetti to make one pound--6 or more bucks for that quantity. Nuts. It's PASTA! They're adding fiber, not truffle oil!<br /><br />A thumbs up. It may not suit a true pasta gourmet, but it makes me very happy...except for the price. But, well, even Dreamfields (my previous higher fiber pasta, which I'll still buy from time to time) isn't cheap compared to the regular pastas<br /><br />Enjoy."
"These pastas are incredible! They don't taste yucky like so many of the wheat pastas. They are white not brown. My husband (who will not eat anything ""diet"") loves them.  I have used in many recipes. The high fiber brings the points way down and fills you up fast."
"As a WW I'm always looking for good, low calorie and more filling foods.  This product does the trick...no taste difference and more filling.  Why don't other manufacturers do the same?  I'm going back to try more.  Thanx!"
"I love pasta, but it does not love me.  I just don't seem to be able to digest it.  But this pasta, not only tastes great, it is so easy to digest.  And, as an added bonus, it is healthy & low in calories.  I have now tried every version of this pasta & they are all amazing.  Some reviewers complained that the pasta is too firm, but that is not the case.  You simply need to cook it a bit longer than regular pasta & then it is light as a feather. Because of how wonderful it tastes & because it is so light, you would think that you were eating homemade pasta.  Almost hard to beleive that this stuff comes out of a box! :-)"
"I had tried the speghetti and it was AWESOME!!! I tried the pasta boxes and they taste normal, you can not tell them apart from the normal noodles you get in the store. I tried the mac/cheese box, the noodles were ok but I am not a fan of the cheese seasoning they give you. I understand they are trying to keep down the calories. I would prefer to buy the noodles and make my own cheese sauce for my mac/cheese in the future. Overall, the pasta is really great."
"This pasta is great! Not really any different from regular pasta but guilt-free, but the cheese sauce for the mac and cheese tastes like cardboard. I won't be getting the variety pack with the mac and cheese again. It was so bad that I rinsed it off and just ate the elbows with pasta sauce. Other than that, everything was great! I will definitely be getting the rotini and penne again."
"This is the best high fiber pasta on the market not to mention it has the highest amount of fiber out there. The pasta is white like regular pasta and is easy to trick your family with, mine didn't know the difference. This sampler pack is great to have on hand. There is enough in each box to feed the whole family. The Mac and cheese is also great. You should Buy this product it is great."
"My daughter and I have been eating lighter for the last year and this product is perfect for us!!  We've both lost a lot of weight, but sometimes missed having a larger portion of pasta with our meals. Fiber Gourmet is so much like regular pasta we can't tell the difference and now we can have a decent serving.  We tried the mac and cheese and while it certainly isn't as cheesy as other products, it is good. My son-in-law actually didn't notice it wasn't Kraft when I added a package of laughing cow at the end since it strengthened the flavor very nicely. I've served this pasta in a baked ziti for company and they never knew it wasn't the real deal at less than half the calories!  I just wish they'd get the spaghetti style in!!"
These pastas are worth a try. Very tasty and nutritious also. Good value. And the sampler pack allows you to try several kinds of pasta.
This pasta is so good I cant believe it has so few calories. It is just right and so easy to incorporate into my weight loss program.  Now I can eat what I love (in moderation) and still loose weight.<br /><br />All that aside the pasta is delicious and I will buy it all the time from now on.  The price is a little high but it is worth it.
"The pasta has a nice texture, very close to regular pasta. However the cheese sauce for the mac is HORRID.<br />I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. It's tastes very chemically.<br />Just buy the pasta and use your own sauce. You'll enjoy the product a lot more."
"I absolutely love this pasta. The end result tastes no different then regular white pasta, plus 18grams of fiber per serving and almost half the calories. No complaints here!"
"Fiber Gourmet has brought pasta back into my life!  At only 130 calories per 2-oz serving, this is so much easier to fit into my diet than regular or even whole wheat pasta.  And it tastes great--the shapes (rotini, penne, elbows) in particular taste just like regular pasta to me."
"This pasta, despite the fiber, did not have me running to the bathroom soon after eating it. It was not hard on my stomach, and filled me up and kept me full for a good part of the day. I have never had such a great experience with pasta!!!"
"I mostly use pastas in baked dishes, and this works well for me.  I did not have the problems of the pasta being too tough.  It's a good choice for people looking for a healthier altenative to whole wheat pasta."
"I am a huge pasta lover, but I've never been a fan of the nutritional stats of regular pastas. They have been getting better with more whole grain/wheat options, however this is by far the best pasta I have found. It did cook up firmer than regular pasta, which is actually something I like about it, and it held it's shape much better when used in soup than regular pasta has for me.<br /><br />The biggest difference I noticed with this pasta was that it was a little more bland tasting than normal pasta, but that really didn't bother me. I found the texture nice, not grainy or chewy at all.<br /><br />I did have to order this online, as it isn't sold anywhere near where I live. I ordered it straight from the Fiber Gourmet website. It shipped quickly, arrived on time and intact. It was more expensive than store bought pasta, I felt the price was fair for the benefits of this pasta."
i got the sampler from the website... with the desserts... the crumb cake is pretty darn good... the brownies not to much... the pasta taste like pasta... doesn't cook in the microwave very well but it is pretty good pasta...
"I ordered pork chops at a restaurant in my home town.  It came with the best BBQ sauce I've ever tasted.  I asked the waitress to find out the name of the sauce and thusI found and purchased thru Amazon, Cattleman's BBQ sauce.  The following link will tell you all about it.  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.  .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UCD76"">Cattlemen's Barbecue Sauce, Carolina Tangy Gold, 18-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>"
"I've had no problems with microwaving this kettle corn. It pops quickly though, so if you microwave it as long as other kinds, (or even as long as the packaging recommends), it will burn. As long as you pull it out as soon as you can start to smell it, it doesn't burn and tastes great."
"Even after trying other gourmet kettle corn, we still keep coming back to this brand..just seems to have more of the kettle corn flavor you find at the local fairs"
"I have tasted nearly every brand of reduced calorie kettle corn on the market and this is by far the best tasting, otherwise, I wouldnt go out of my way to purchase it online. Moreover, my 12 year-old daughter agrees with me-which is a rarity. Unfortunately, I have a hard time finding this product in local markets.  Definitely worth a try for health conscious people with discerning taste buds."
"This popcorn is just the right amount of sweet: not so overpowering that it tastes like candy, but you can definitely tell that it's kettle corn!<br /><br />The portion size is also perfect for one person. I consider myself a relatively big eater, but by the time I'm done with one bag I'm pretty satisfied (mostly because it takes so much time to get through one).<br /><br />I also like the nutrition breakdown of this popcorn: lots of fiber (4g), a solid amount of protein (3g), and no sugar. Sure, it has ~4g of fat, but overall it's almost a perfect ratio of fat to carbs to protein, with the added benefit of the fiber and lack of sugar. What a great snack! I can't think of any other food item that is only 100 calories, tastes this good, has even a marginally good nutrient breakdown, and tides you over for an hour or more."
I LOVE this product and fewer and fewer stores are carrying it. It is the perfect snack size and at only 100 calories and wheat and gluten free...it is a wonderful part of my daily routine. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. It his the spot every time. I take a bag to the movies to avoid the calories and salt in the movie theatre popcorn. :)
"I, like another writer said, have tried so many brands of Kettle Corn.  Hands<br />down this is the best.  I like the 100 calorie bags because it saves counting<br />and measuring (if you can stop at one bag)!"
"I have tried the other 100 cal kettle corns and none of them are near as good. Unfortunately, I have only tried the other ones cause I suspect this one has been discontinued (It was getting hard to find in my local stores and my roommate bought me some off Amazon, and he bought a lot of them actually but once that supply runs out :( ). Jolly time came a far second and Orville.. blech.<br /><br />Anyways, it is a shame if it has been discontinued because honestly, it was the best. In fact, I've noticed in general Pop Secret does the best microwave popcorn (I also wish they still had the regular kettle corn in single packs... that stuff was really good but usually I'm watching my weight so I tend to stick to the 100 calorie stuff)."
"I am a major snacker and love these mini bags. Granted, I can eat 2-3 in a sitting but I want the option of stopping before I reach 200-300 calories.<br /><br />The bags are larger than some mini bags so the kernels pop nicely and don't burn.<br /><br />The flavor is mild though and I often add cinnamon and a bit of brown sugar to make it sweeter. Sooo good! All in all, I love these mini bags and will keep them stocked!"
"Very good flavor! Not too salty, not too sweet. Perfect size for a snack. Pops up perfectly on the popcorn setting. Will definitely buy again."
I think this popcorn taste fine.. I dont know why others say it taste stale I buy a box almost every month and its a cheap snack with Amazon's schedule and save..
"There were a lot of negative reviews but I still bought this anyway. It tasted like the kettle corn you get from the store. The bags are small, but they are 100 calorie packs, they work great for my lunch and when you want a small snack with not all of the fat. You have to be careful not to put on the normal popcorn setting or you will burn it."
The bag popped well and the first bite tasted fresh but then my mouth became coated with a horrible fake sugar taste that made me feel almost sick. I couldn't even come close to finishing the bag. I admit I should have read the ingredients more closely to see that they included sucralose but this may be one of the worst snacks I have had ever! I feel bad even giving it away to someone.
"I was really disappointed when my local grocer stopped carrying this variety. It is great to have portion control built in. I like the flavor, although I don't think it tastes a lot like kettle corn. I prefer it over an artificial ""butter"" flavor. I like that it is dry and not greasy. Taste is a personal matter, of course. You'd have to try it to see if you like it. I listened to the popping a few times and now I know exactly what time to set on my microwave. I tried that same time at work, and, goodness, that was a burnt offering! But I know now what time works on that microwave. You know how packages always say ""applicances vary, adjust the time accordingly""? Well, yeah, they are right! I am glad to have a source for this product now."
"Good popcorn, bad Kettle Corn flavoring.  Some bags taste ok, but others have no kettle corn taste."
"description didn't include that this is made with splenda, which is SUPER bad for you (liver and kidney swelling at 'normal' doses.) plus it tastes weird and leaves a gross aftertaste. bleh.<br /><br />but if you can deal with the aforementioned it's a nifty size package."
"This popcorn was either very old or just poor quality. More than half the kernals did not pop, we ended up throwing more than half of the box of unpopped popcorn Kettle corn away. Total waste of money."
"I have to say I was very disappointed in the taste of this product.  Plenty of salty, very little, or no sweet.  Since I have enjoyed other flavors of Pop Secret, I was surprised at the Kettle Corn.  If I was just looking for a tasty microwave popcorn, this would be fine, but I wanted the salty and sweet which this fails for deliver."
"The taste is good.  However, I will not buy again because every piece of popped corn has the corn husk on it.  Ruins an otherwise pretty decent bag of popcorn."
NO One Would Buy This Pop Corn ~  That's Why They Do Not Put The OZ on Box ~OR~ Bags ~ TOTALLY Only A Child Size Product ~ A Real RIP OFF ~ U Get What U Pay For ~ Buy Another Brand That's Better Tasting ~N~ NOT AFRAID To Put OZ. Of Product on Bag ~OR~ Box
"We bought the package of Pop-Secret Microwave Kettle Corn ""100 Calorie Pop"" 10 ct. Snack Bags and it almost ruined my microwave. I have a very expensive Jenn Air microwave with a POPCORN sensor on it. The first bag I tried, after about 30 seconds the microwave started moaning and buzzing really loud. I went over to take a look, and it was like a light show going on inside. I quickly opened the door, and could feel the pressure from inside push the door open! I figured maybe it was just that particular bag, so I tried another. SAME THING HAPPENED. If my microwave breaks anytime in the near future I would bet that this popcorn incident is to blame. DO NOT BUY-SERIOUS SAFETY RISK. I am calling Diamond Foods to complain. It's a good thing my kids were not making this popcorn on their own!"
"These seem to ""hit the spot"" for any dog in my neighborhood, and not just my own. So I would reccomend them as an altenative to the other biscuits that may not be so healthful for doggies."
"My chihuahua absolutely delights in this Old Mother Hubbard snack.  His ears go up and he jumps for joy when I ask him if he wants BIG TREAT.  I give them inbetween meals, since he is always demanding to be fed.  He must love the taste and I feel pleased that he is eating something good for him.  His happy crunching tells it all."
"There are so many dog treats to choose from these days but I always find Mother Hubbard to be perfect for my dog.  She is a real food hound and when I purchase the low fat veggie ones, usually in the ""mini"" size, I don't feel so guilty when I give them to her.  I also break even the teeny ones in 1/2 so the calories don't add up quickly. And, she loves them."
"My small mixed-breed guy loves these. Of course, he loves most everything, but this is a treat that  doesn't put the pounds on him the way others do."
My dogs love these and I feel good giving these to them because the ingredients are so good.  This is a good price compared to the big pet stores.
I have two Pot Bellied Pigs and they just love these treats. And I don't worry about giving them these snacks because they are so low in fat. You have no idea how fast pigs gain weight!
"I've tried these cans of Roland Tropical Mixed Fruits twice and both cases were not very good tasting.  I was hoping the first batch was an anomaly.  I found the convenience of them to be great but obviously the fruits were not truly ripe when they were canned.  I'd say it was 50/50.....1/2 ripe and 1/2 upripe fruits.  My family ate them but a truly ripe papaya, pineapple, or mango would have made this easy dessert way more desirable.  I won't be buying these again even though getting a variety of tropical fruits in one can is a great idea."
"!!HEY, these are BIG! There are actually two candy bars in each of these wraps, (36 servings) so two people can enjoy Baby Ruth, or eat one for now, save one for later! Each bar is 250 calories, has 2 grams of protein and 16 carbs. NO trans fat and no cholesterol, either!  My sister and I love these King Size Baby Ruth bars because each of us gets a BIG bar and is not tempted to consume BOTH! (You know, once the wrapper is ripped open and the other candy bar is just sitting there!) Great idea Nestle had! This is an excellent afternoon pick me up snack!"
"This was a great deal on this king sized box of Baby Ruth bars.  The only problem is that they are harder than a rock when you bite into them.  Made my jaw ache just eating one.  I normally like Baby Ruth bars, but I think these were on a bit of the old side."
Taste good i would give a 5 star except the chocolate crumbles when eaten at colder temperatures.
"Great product, horrible shipping. Only 8 of 12 cans made it successfully during shipping. You'll only get a refund on the purchase price and not on shipping, which is most of the cost of the product. I've ordered large and small plastic bottles from a different Vender (British Delights) without any shipping casualties. The cans that did make it taste just fine (mmmm good!)"
"I bought a case of this breading cuz a Facebook friend raved about it and where I live I couldnt find in my local supermarkets so I had to buy a case online. The breading has a good taste to it but I thought it would have more kick to it, I first tried it frying sum chicken,it was cool but no kick,then I read it would hav more kick if I cook the chicken in the oven,still no kick. I jus add sum Cayenne pepper to the breading and BAM,I got my kick! Im not a big fan of supa spicy foods but I do like sum kick to my chicken from time to time."
"After my positive experience with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUT89A"">Health Valley Cookie Cremes, Double Chocolate</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2S"">Newman's Own Organics Newman-O'S Ginger-O's, 16-Ounce Packages</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027CE2I"">Newman's Own Organics Alphabet Cookies, Cinnamon, 10-Ounce Bags</a>, I thought I would give Country Choice a go.  So far, I'm ""4-for-4"" in ordering good organic cookies.  I took a chance and bought them without trying them first.  I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon is a good tasting cookie that have all the benefits of sweetness we would expect from cookies, but lacking the artificial ingredients consistent with cookies commonly on the market.  The cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, but the taste is quite strong and the cookies are sweet, a surprise from my initial introduction to organic cookies that had the flavor and consistency of the cardboard box they were stored in.<br /><br />There are some points the consumer needs to know; they may be minuses for some, but they're certainly pluses for me:<br /><br />1) The cookies are VERY sweet; I had to have a glass of milk with them.  While I adore sweet cookies, it may turn some people off.  Be mindful of that.<br /><br />2) The taste of ginger is overwhelmed by the strongest taste of lemon in cookies I've ever had.  To me this would be a significant minus, except that I absolutely love the lemony taste in cookies.  The aroma is heavenly, but the taste is so powerful it seems almost artificial.  Oddly, I can taste a hint of ginger when they're dunked in milk (any explanation from food chemists/scientists out there?).  Again I love that taste, but others may not.  If you want the gingery taste, you would have to be an expert food taster to find it here (in my opinion).<br /><br />3) While these cookies are made with organic and natural ingredients (no hydrogenated oils or trans fats), they're still cookies: they are loaded with sugar, sodium and carbs.  Two cookies pack a whopping 130 calories; 50 calories from fat.  Remember, organic does not always mean healthy.  And because these cookies are lighter than other organic cookies I've tried, and very tasty, it is very easy to overeat them.<br /><br />4) These cookies (barely) pass my all-important ""dunkability"" test, where they adequately absorb milk to compliment the flavor of the cookies (Oreo's, despite their artificial ingredients, is still king in the dunkability of cookies, in my honest opinion).  They taste delicious when dunked, but these cookies begin to fall apart quickly, so holding them under milk for a length of time could be problematic.<br /><br />Given the minuses I've indicated, you wonder: why do I give it four stars.  Simple: I love them.  Taste, like beauty, is in the eye (or palate) of the beholder.  And I can't get enough of them.  While my opinion is unquestionably biased, I try to give as much unbiased information on the product as I can.  Use it to make your decision.<br /><br />As with all Amazon grocery products, I recommend going to a supermarket or specialty store (Whole Foods, for example), buy a single pack and sample the cookies before you buy the entire case.  I took a gamble and bought the case untested; it's a gamble that has paid dividends for me."
"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Vanilla creme filling between two vanilla wafers. The vanilla wafers are very light and crispy which goes well with the smooth vanilla creme. Vanilla bliss. More crumbly than the chocolate wafers. Kosher D from processing on shared equipment. 65 kcal per cookie. I put 2-4 cookies in zipper snack bags to make convenient portions. I save and reuse these snack bags for when I open the next ""big"" package. Easy to keep these fresh in an airtight cookie jar or gallon (4 ltr) ziplock bag. Wanted to also try this flavor because these cookies are such a great organic cookie value.

"I admit, I only bought this product (instead of Oreos) because there were FEWER cookies in the bag (thus fewer calories). And I was blown away! These are sooooo much better than Oreos! And organic. Amazing."
"These organic cookies are absolutely delicious! The chocolate tastes rich and not overly sweet, and this is balanced nicely by the vanilla half. The nutrition facts and ingredient list are the icing on the cake - so much better for you than Oreos and just as good (if not better) tasting. They may be more expensive than Oreos but it is well worth it. Highly recommended."
"Country Choice Organic Ginger Lemon cookies are the tastiest sandwich cookies on the market.  They have a tangy, fresh flavor that tickles the tongue and sets them apart from other, more mundane cookies.  I only wish that they were more widely available locally.  My whole family goes through six packages in about a week.  If you want to stock your larder with an adventurous snack, you can't miss with these delicious sandwich cookies."
"I never thought I'd find something comparable to those choc-mint Girl Scout cookies (sorry Girls), but these are some of the yummiest cookies I've ever had - certainly the best packaged I've ever had. If you like choc-mint, don't pass on these. AND ORGANIC TOO!"
These taste just like the Oreo Golden cookies.  We love vanilla sandwich cookies and were looking for healthier choice.  These organic cookies are just the perfect solution.  Healthier (than cookies with unnameable ingredients) and delicious!
"These chocolate cookies are an organic version of Oreo-type cookies but are far superior than that name brand, in my opinion.  They are seriously addicting and I cannot buy them anymore because I tend to eat toooooooo many and the package is gone in a couple/few days.  They are not particularly healthy - they are a cookie, after all!  The cookie part is nice and crunchy (almost tending toward light and crisp) with an excellent chocolate flavor.  The filling is great - smooth and creamy (does not get hard like some other oreo-types) with a good degree of sweetness.  I have also tried the Paul Newman brand of oreos and was not that impressed.  The Country Choice far exceeds all other brands - highly recommend!"

Closest to regular Oreos among the organic ones....we cannot eat regular ones any more...we have grown to love these.
"My local supermarket carries Country Choice Vanilla Wafers, but not the sandwich cookies.  These are truely a melt-in-your-mouth treat.  The cookies do crumble easily, unlike the more famous chocolate sandwich cookie, but the vanilla creme more than makes up for that.  I just ordered the last box, sorry folks, you'll have to wait for a new shipment!"
My kids loved these cookies.  They could not tell the difference between these and Oreos.  I would not recommend eating as many as you want as the last reviewer stated.  Two cookies contain 130 calories but your body should process it better than items containing refined sugar.
Clean tasting cookies. Just wish they can make it a little less sweet. Much better tasting and superior ingredients than regular cookies like Oreo. You can feel the difference in every bite.
"These cookies are great. Far better than Newman's.  My husband loves these cookies, and they have been slowly disappearing from grocery shelfs.  Actually, they HAVE disappeared.  Now...yippee!<br /> I bought the '6 pack' for my husband for Christmas, and he had tears in his eyes...I'd been searching for them since I found a cache while on vacation last summer (when we went back for a fall visit, the store no longer carried them!). Worth the price.  He's stretched 4 packs for 2 months...I want to be sure to get them while they are still available HERE!  THE FREE SHIPPING makes buying here much cheaper than buying from the 'factory' website...same price, but expensive shipping."
"Great product!!!!! Some of the best cookies on the market.Shame local grocery stores do not carry these, at least not in NC. Buy these from Amazon only and get free shipping. Buy from any other seller here(Nutricity) and it will cost you double what Amazon sells them for ."
These cookies smell like 'real' oreos when you open the package.  But they are organic and have no saturated fats.<br /><br />My son has autism issues as well as type 1 diabetes and these are a great snack for him.
I've bought these cookies from my local store and they are hands down the best organic sandwich cookie.  All other brands of organic sandwich cookies come no where near on taste and texture.  I always get this brand now.
"For those of you who remember Hydrox, the battle continues - now in organic land.  Newman's chocolate creme sandwich is tasteless. It can't hold a candle to even the original Oreo.  But Country Choice is as close as I can recall to the Hydrox brand.  These are delicious! Give them a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Most Stop and Shop carry them."
"Country Choice, I love these cookies.  Both Newmano's and Country Choice Sandwich Cremes are ORGANIC, but even though Newmano's are yummy, I like the texture of the cookie part of Country Choice.  And, they are made in Minnesota which is the best.  Move aside ""Oreos"".  Country Choice are better than ""Oreos""...organic and better tasting.  The only downside is the name, not very catchy.  Yeah for Amazon Subscribe and Save for the price."
"I decided to start an organic diet. I started with Newman's cookies.  Amazon had a sale, and I decided to give County Choice a chance.<br />I am SOOOOOOOOO glad I did.  I love them.  They are better than OREO's."
"How about $1.50/12oz. pack at a special discount store in Ft. Worth?  Yes, they have gone out of date, but do I care?  They are good, but I have to pace myself and not lose control.  So far, the only ones they have had are the vanilla.  I long for the old Keebler Vanilla Cremes that, like so many other Keebler cookies, are not made anymore.  These are really good."
"I always wanted a organic snack that tasted good. For me they the best, as they are organic, good tasting and reasonable price. I always bought them on sale at our local grocery, but that didn't happen too often. When I found them on Amazon, at a lower price, it was a no brainer to order them. I have my order set up to repeat on schedule, so I don't even have to take time to order."
"I have never in my life written a review on any product until today. These cookies have compelled me to speak out! The Ginger Lemon is just great! The ginger is not over powering and the lemon is tart and sweet. Together, they are amazing. But, even better, in my opinion, split the cookie open! I love to eat the crispy ginger outer shell and then savor the lemony middle. The only down side, I can eat the whole package in one sitting!"
"Organic does not equal healthy. OK?<br /><br />That out of the way, these are super yummy. Far better than Newman's Ginger-O (and I'm usually a big Newman Organics fan) and the hint of lemon is very, very good.<br /><br />These are addictive in a Girl Scout Cookie kind of way and, yeah, I do think they're a better choice than, say, Oreos, but this is still a processed snack food, no doubt about it, albeit one with an ingredient list you can actually pronounce."
Best cookies ever! Honestly my fav!! And they are WAYYY healthier than almost any other cookie. I love these and the price is great on here especially with subscribe and save!
"I agree with all the other reviewers who state that these are delicious lemon cookies. However, one stated that they are extremely lemony, which I did not find. They are sweet and lemony, but not excessively at all. Perhaps our lemon perceptors are quite different. Anyway, they are terrific, and this is coming from someone raised on Oreos, etc. who is very picky about their organic and natural products measuring up in taste to the tasty junk out there.<br />Amazon shipped them quickly and well packaged also."
I love these cookies I think they taste better then Oreos and buying them in bulk happens to be a little cheaper then at the grocery store.
"These cookies are great! I did not think that I would find anything that even remotely come close to oreo, but they do. Actually, I like these better. You can eat as many as you want and not get sick. Try that with  non-organic cookies. When eating organic cookies, you actually taste the quality. You will not get a sugar rush (headache) like the rest."
"These delicious cookies are free of trans fats.  They do have 130 calories in two cookies, so one should practice moderation.  We have been enjoying them for years, particularly in Vanilla, but they can be difficult to find.  Amazon offers them at a good price.  The cookies are available in Ginger-Lemon, as well, which are good sometimes for variety."
These are delicious.  My teenage daughter likes them much better than any other brand.  She says they soak up milk better when dipped.  And it's nice that there is no trans fat or high fructose corn syrup!
"This product is wonderful!  A nice change of pace for those wanting a nice cookie that is tasty, yet not too sweet. It is nice and flavorful, and makes a perfect afternoon or early evening snack with a hot beverage or a cold glass of milk.  I highly recommend them!"
"I have to admit I expected these cookies to be mediocre since they are ""organic"". Most of the time organic prepared foods mean ""flavored with fruit juice instead of real sugar"". Yes, I love sugar even if it is bad for me and these cookies balance sugar, chocolate, and vanilla perfectly. My biggest problem will be not eating too many of them since they come in bulk. I'm just hoping they last 2 weeks!<br /><br />Now I plan to buy the other flavors of this brand."
"The Duplex cookies are delicious!  It is difficult to keep a package in the cabinet for long periods of time because everyone needs ""just one more.""  Excellent organic cookie that I will be purchasing regularly."
"These are the best cookies I've ever had.  I was never a fan of oreo-type cookies until I tasted these!!  With a really nice cookie outside and a mint creme that is delicious (they're not too minty but just right), you will LOVE these cookies!!  I am now a fan - and the fact that they're organic is an added bonus."
I don't know why but they changed the recipe or I got 2 bad bags of cookies in the last 2 weeks from local store.  I used to love these but they don't have the same chocolate taste.  I recomend Newman's.
These are my favorite chocolate sandwich cookie.  The chocolate is more semisweet than the other famous brand & these are also not so sugary sweet.  They are not health food (darn) but are a tasty treat in moderation.
This product taste great and is worth the money.  I receive this product via subscribe and save subscription and am so happy Amazon has this option for a great product.
"UPS just delivered them so of course I had to try them before lunch. The chocolate wafer is nice and crisp and the mint creme center has a moderate mint flavor. If you take the wafer apart like one would do for an Oreo, the center is a bit gritty like the sugar wasn't fully blended. However I still prefer these over an Oreo since the combined flavor is wonderful and they are organic. Now I wish I'd purchased the oatmeal and chocolate chip while the coupon offer existed. These small 6 packages will disappear too quickly at my house."
"The whole family LOVES these fudgy, chocolately treats! Knowing they are 100% Organic and have only healthy, pure ingredients not only makes them Taste Better but I (mom) feel much less guilty when I am enjoying them! My daughter demands that two of these always be present whenever I pack a school lunch. My toddler can't get enought so I have to hide them sometimes and my husband would sit down and eat half the container if I didn't shoo him away. Good Stuff!"
Just bought these again at Kroger- Unbelievably tasty- beats Oreo but is more expensive and actually worth it- plus no high fructose sugar.
I have reason to believe that these are the absolute best cookies that have ever been made and I am very excited to know that they are available on here!  :)  Woo-hoo!  I could eat these non-stop for days.
"I ordered the ginger lemon cremes, but was very disappointed to find Amazon screwing up so badly.  The outside of the box as shipped from the vendor to Amazon clearly says ""VANILLA"" in very large letters, but Amazon slapped a sticker with a barcode on it that tags the box of cookies as ""ginger lemon cremes,"" so now instead of enjoying the ginger lemon cremes I had been looking forward to tasting, I have to go through the hassle of trying to return these and hopefully get Amazon to send me the right product a second time around.  So, now I have to wait to see if I actually get ginger lemon cremes in another few weeks or however long Amazon takes.  Boy, their service has gotten worse and worse every year since I started buying stuff from Amazon back in their early days."
"I still find it strange that the so-called ""thyme honey"" is not aromatic. I have never tried Greek honey before and I found it rather strange. Meanwhile I tried other kinds of Greek Honey and I begin to understand that it is different from other kinds of honey... It is thicker and even though not so aromatic it still tastes good, therefore I upgraded my rating. Not bad at all... just different."
"This review is for the coffee, not the roaster (Jersey Shore Coffee Roasters). The roaster is fantastic. I would order from them again. True to their word, the coffee had been roasted 3 days before it arrived; the perfect time to give it a try. It came in a resealable gold foil/mylar exhaust pouch with a flat bottom. It was clearly labeled with the coffee type and roast date. Now on to the product.<br /><br />I've been curious about 100% Blue Mountain estate coffees for years, and after much research, the Mavis Bank Estate came up as one of two that I wanted to try. I ordered the 1/2 pound bag; partially because this bean is so %^#* expensive, and also because I didn't want to get stuck with a pound of beans I might not like, and wish I had the fifty bucks back in my pocket. I much prefer Kona or a Costa Rican peaberry to this. It's a nice coffee; maybe too ""nice"". If you're a connoisseur of mild coffees, this is the one for you. It makes Gevalia Light Roast taste like French roast. Too delicate for my taste. I made a few pots, and kept increasing the amount of coffee. It looked pretty scary whe I was using 6 scoops for five ""cups"", but always tasted bland and watery. I tried it with just a hint of sugar, and nothing else.<br /><br />I'm not into 100% dark roasts at all; I hate that burnt taste. In fact I use a medium roast for my espresso machine. I'll try running some of this through it. Maybe It'll extract some flavor from this curious bean."
"I have a Boxer and they tend to have sensitive stomachs.  She does really well on this food, plus it's good for her.  My vet said Merrick was one of the best dog foods on the market.  I highly recommend it for your pet!"
"Our dog really seems to like Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food.  We had been feeding Merrick Five Star Wilderness Blend which she liked as well but this is a less expensive but equal quality alternative.  Great product, great price and with free shipping so easy and convenient."
"I used to buy a different bag of dog food everytime I would go to H-E-B for my dogs..I KNOW, don't hit me! I'm horrible! :( lol. I had to buy dog food and puppy food since I have two dogs of different ages. Once my Chow started hitting a year though (thank the Lord!), I wanted to buy the same dog food for both my dogs. I started getting a litte more concerned about the quality of my dog food and this was the cheapest I could start off with. It's been amazing so far (it's been two months). My German Shepherd mix has actually gained weight and that made me so happy! I got her when she was 100+ pounds but I think the transition from owner to owner got her kinda sad and she dropped to the 70 pound range and no matter how hard I tried, she wouldn't eat. Now, she's always hitting up her feeder and is back up to 85 pounds. Her coat looks great; very shiny! It's also been good to my Chow. I had read better ingredients made the dog poop less and I didn't believe that until I purchased this food. It's a very surprising change. Overall, very glad I decided to be a more informed pet owner. This is the top rated dog food on Petco.com right now and all of the reviews concur with the fact that it's the best bang for your buck. VERY HAPPY!"
"I've loved European soft drinks since being introduced to them in Sweden as a teenager--""sockerdricka,"" a banana-flavored carbonated beverage, was my favorite.  Far more variety than their American competitors--and less sweet!  For a buck a can you can't beat a Limonata with its foiled cover (so chic, lots of cachet conveyed to the consumer even before the first sparkly sip) and its crisp, just-sour-enough flavor.  Count me a subscriber of this one (if only American beverage-makers weren't so terrified of marketing anything that wasn't loaded up and down (the adrenaline pattern of the consumer's blood sugar counts) with dozens of teaspoons full of sugar (call it fructose, honey, sucrose, dextrose--it's still gratuitous, unhealthy, taste-neutral sugar!).<br /><br />This has quickly become my second favorite drink available from Amazon.  The first is Blenheim ginger ale.  (Don't even consider any other brand, regardless of its price or ""exotic"" origins.  It's all bland.)  Blenheim is the only ginger ale that will clean out your sinuses, ream out your internal plumbing and, as James Brown used to say, put pep in your step and gut in your strut.  Burn, baby, burn!  (Could just as well be Blenheim's motto.)"
"I hate sparkling water, so I was reluctant to try this for fear that it would taste like S. Pellegrino's sparkling mineral water...much to my amazement, I LOVE the taste of this! I love pretty much anything with a lemon flavor to it, and although this isn't really a lemon flavor per se, it has enough of a lemon taste to be called ""limonata."" This looks like a traditional soda, since it comes in a traditional soda aluminum can. This, however, is more of a carbonated sour lemon drink that is more cool and refreshing than any soda without being excessively sweet or syrupy like regular citrus sodas can be. The only catch is that it really is sour (not excessive, but fairly strong in sourness), so if you don't like sour things you will not like this drink. You are better off going with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Sparkling Beverage, Orange, 11.15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, which is not sour at all and is more of a sweet, orange flavor. If you like lemons or if you are tired of the usual Sprite/Sierra Mist/Mountain Dew flavors then give this drink a try. It is a refreshingly different twist."
"San Pellegrino, Limonata; still manufactured in Italy. Still the same great intense lemon flavor without all the sweetness. A beverage to be savored and drunk slowly. They're now packaged in this more American, big old serving size, almost 12 ounces. I loved this drink when it was in those little tiny 3 or 4 ounce bottles."
"I first tried a sampling of the San Pellegrino Limonata at Costco and IMMEDIATELY fell in love with this drink.  It is Heaven on Earth PERFECTION!!!  I HAD to buy it right then.  Now I can only find it at certain times of the year then I tried Amazon, and to my amazement, it's here.  I can get more anytime I want......FINALLY!!!  If you like tangy drinks...this is the one for you!!!  I found my favorite chili (WOLF CHILI NO BEANS)and now my favorite drink, both on AMAZON!!!  I will definately belooking for more ofmy favorites of everything from food to movies and music to books.<br /><br />Again......  If you like tangy drinks...this is the one for you!!!"
"I absolutely love this drink.  It is a must try for anyone who likes sour drinks.  It is very fizzy and tart with a great lemon taste and scent.  It tastes very light too and even though it has as much sugar as a soft drink, it is not overly sweet.  I love the little covers on top because it keeps the lip clean."
"Awesome flavor on first taste, and the carbonation just enhances the pleasure! I just tasted it approximately 5 minutes ago, and it will definitely be my new drink of choice."
"Although not too sweet, it does have just enough sweetness to carry it through. It is also quite tart, and as a whole, is very tasty. I prefer their Aranciata flavor, but my girlfriend prefers these. Go figure, lol. Really though, this is an excellent sparkling beverage. Plus, the subscription price is really a great deal. Individually, these average $1.29 each here in SLC, but the 24 pack is around $16 here on Amazon. Bueno. Enjoy!"
"I have not tasted any other beverage on the market quite like it.  If you have ever enjoyed fresh-squeezed lemonade with lots of lemons, you will like this drink.  If you are a person (like me) who enjoys eating plates full of lemon wedges, you will love this stuff.  I bought multiple cases and am enjoying every refreshing can.  Who needs all of the over-caffeinate science experiment energy drinks - one sip of this will wake you right up!"
My mom is Italian and she just celebrated her 95th birthday party. My sister from Illinois bought the beverages for the party and brought the San Pellegrino Limonta and also their orange drink. I love anything lemon. I just love this product. It was in the high 90's the day of the party - what a hit this refreshing drink was. I couldn't find in local stores so purchased from Amazon. My mom has one or two cans every day. Very nice sparkle. The lemon is nice a tart and taste like fresh lemons. The orange is a little sweeter.
"The perfect summer drink; not quite lemonade not quite lemon-flavored sparking water. It is about half way in between.  Do note that this isn't just flavored sparking water- there is some sugar added so you are looking at 150 calories or so a can.  Half of a can of soda or lemonade, but a lot more than just water and lemon slices added.  Still, I had a very hard time keeping them in the fridge this brutally hot summer and they were great in my brown bag lunches.  The orange flavor is very good as well  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Sparkling Beverage, Orange, 11.15-Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a>"
"I had this drink at a restaurant while on vacation and I liked it so much that I had already ordered a case online before I was even home! It is very tart, but that's what I love about it.  It is definitely not sweet like the lemon-lime sodas you may be used to. I have also tried the orange and blood-orange versions of this drink but still prefer the limonata. Delicious and very refreshing! I can imagine it would be fabulous in a cocktail."
"Very lemony and a bit sweet, this stuff is WAY better than what I was expecting. I took my daughter on a walk today and it was VERY hot, so we stopped by our local convenience store. I wanted a beverage that wasn't soda, and I already had a water in the stroller. I grabbed this, expecting it to be like perrier lemon, which is just so-so. I didn't want a soda because I generally don't do sugary stuff but I bought it without looking at the ingredients, in a hurry. I got outside the store and popped the top. It IS very much a soda, a lemonade soda in fact, but one without tons of ingredients (I checked after I tasted he sweetness of it). I gave my daughter a sip, and she started immediately fussing ""shook, shook!"" (juice lol) for more. This is one sodapop I'll definitely get again. It is DELICIOUS!!!"
"Love this stuff! It is to lemonade what the starship Enterprise is to a Bi-Plane. Not that I would know first hand, but I hear tell that it goes pretty good with Vodka!"
"All I could taste was the lemon. Not like lemonade, much more sour. I tried watering it down and adding sugar, but no luck. I couldn't drink this beverage."
"Wonderfully refreshing.  I find other brands of sparking lemonade (Sunkist) to be too sweet so I agree with reviewers that say this is more tart, but not extremely. Great mixed with Woodford Reserve bourbon."
"Both the lemon and the orange San Pellegrino are the perfect soft drink (contrary to some reviewers, I don't find the lemon tart or sour at all - it has just the perfect tinge of sweetness)and the perfect cocktail mixers.  Vodka and lemon or vodka and organge over ice are the new ""house drinks"" at my parties - everyone loves them.  Try the orange with a splash of tequila for a most unusual and delicious margarita.  I am hopelessly addicted to this stuff.  If you have a Gelson's market nearby, they carry it (it's currently on sale for $3.99 for a six pack).  Great stuff."
"Finally a lemon soda really worthy of its name. All the usual ones, such as 7 up, Sprite, mountain Dew, and the million other generic-type citrus based soft drinks can't even compare. They are just too sweet and seriously lack any natural lemon taste. Also, the usual sweetener used for them is corn syrup, cheap to produce and with an objectional after taste. San Pellegrino Limonata has real lemon flavor because of the real juice content and is sweetened with real sugar. It's the new standard for the ideal citrus soft drink, as far as I am concerned."
"This is my favorite drink atm.. Still has high calories ( 150 a can/ 35 grams carbs ) but tasts great really cold and even better with a spash of Vodka...  I bought this flavor and the orange, and prefer this flavor. A fun extra tasty sparkling lemonade drink! :)"
This lemonade is the best I have ever had !!! I would recommend this as a great way to discover this companys products
"I love this stuff! I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon! It is refreshing and tasty, and not sweet. It is tart and lemony."
"REALLY GOOD STUFF...VERY SOUR.<br />Cans a a bit small, but with the subscription price not too bad. Excellent alternative to soda"
"If you're a fan of sour-ball candies, you might like this Italian-made drink. This product contains eighteen percent pure lemon juice [roughly two ounces]...a bit too much for the amount of fluid in an eleven ounce can. They loaded thirty-six grams of sugar into this beverage, but still, it was not enough to counteract the extreme sour taste. If you chill it way down, it becomes quite drinkable, but be forewarned, the acidic level is nearly caustic and may cause you to gasp. I had higher expectations for this drink, since its orange-flavored cousin is delicious. The old Latin admonition,'caveat emptor', definitely applies here."
"The lemon flavor is a little overwhelming, almost tasting artificial. I need to drink this with ice and it tastes pretty good like this!"
"Expecting a GREAT item from Alaska Smokehouse and this is not it!  It tastes OK; I've had much better tasting smoked salmon.  We bought smoked salmon last time we were in Ketchikan, maybe I was expecting comparable quality.  I think even my local Trader Joe's carries a fresher, better tasting smoked salmon..."
High quality Alaskan wild caught smoked salmon at a very reasonable price
"Very unimpressive for smoked salmon.  Filet still had the skin on it, found bones (remember this is supposed to be a filet), so much fish oil in the package (once opened it was more of a mess than a treat.  Was no better than a can of salmon, except at much higher price tag.  I was expecting a ""gourmet food product"" and was highly disappointed."
"These are not quite «Cornichons extra fins» or fine gherkins for the USA. Inside this huge can, the average cornichons size is much bigger then the ones found inside a jar from Maille or even Carrefour brand. The vinegar used is just pure white vinegar instead of the more refines white wine vinegar used for Maille or Carrefour. Inside this huge can, I only found like ~5 or 6 pickle white pearl onion. There is more pearl onion inside a Maille jar (220g jar)!?!<br />Furthermore, even if the cornichons are grown & packed in India, the quality is still there but not the refinement. Many of them still have a small stem attached.<br />In conclusion, this will not replace the french quality & refinement but for what we can find in the USA, for the quality/price, is still hard to beat especially when a Maille jar is selling for ~$5 (220g) in a grocery store & if you can find it!!!"
"Not really the French equivalent, but good nonetheless.  So far, the best French cornichons I've found come from, of course, Germany."
"This very large can contains typical French style tiny gerghins.  Very sharp and crunchy.  If you are used to Dessaux brand or Amora brand, you will not be disappointed and the price is a fraction of what you pay in the better stores if they cary this item.  When I saw that these were made in India I was a bit worried that they would not have the taste I was looking for, but they proved to be excellent (Vinegar, tarragon, pickling spices - NO sugar) and tiny as supposed to be. I repack them for my pantry in recycled glass jars.  Now I have good cornichons to accompany charcuterie and cold meats as well as making sauces, steak tartat and whatnot. I am very pleased and have added this item to my Amazon shopping list.  Alas I am a bit in a pickle because I cannot stop eating them."
Actually bought this exact item at the grocery store.  I love pickled eggs but these are absolutely awful.  It is all in the quality of eggs rather than the flavor really.  These eggs were just like rubber and the yolk had no discernible flavor.  These eggs are of just horrible quality and I'll be forced to throw the remaining out.
"My husband does not usually like refried beans, but even he can get down with these. The texture is smooth, and it might help that I smother them in cheese and put them under the broiler. Awesome with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWLR72"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Three Grain, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. A 1/2 cup serving has 100 calories (0 from fat), 18 carbs and 6 grams of protein."
"I live in E.Tennessee, near a very large ConAgra plant. (These are made by ConAgra.) I don't know if these are made here, or were brought to this plant, but they were always available at the ""Company Store"" day for employees. A friend used to work there and would buy a case or 2 for me every time they were available. Prior to that I had never seen the product. They ARE NOT available in any store near me and they are not available in Chicagoland where I moved from 12 years ago. I am absolutely THRILLED that Amazon has this product. Through the years I have made my own fat free ""refried beans"" and Mexican Rice, and tried to keep meal sized portions of each in the freezer, but there is absolutely nothing faster than grabbing a can of these, some cheese, onion, flour tortillas, and making quickie burritos. OR, try adding some jalapenos and cheese and having a great, healthy dip in a couple of minutes in the microwave. The spicing is just right, the consistency is just right, they are nutritious without out any calories from fat, and they are so versatile. (My homemade Mexican Rice thaws faster than my homemade ""refried beans"" did.) I hate admitting to such laziness and impatience, but at least I have this wonderful product to reduce my sense of guilt. Amazon, Please keep carrying these and start carrying the other 2 NO FAT versions of Rosarita Refried Beans!!!"
"It's a nice way to purchase rosarita refried beans no fat, when the local market do not sell this item."
"As a displaced Californian now living on the east coast, I have some specific tastes when it comes to Mexican cuisine.  I cannot always find the brands that meet my expectations in taste and quality.  I use Amazon to purchase staples such as these to keep stocked up.  Rosarita is a brand that I can trust to have the flavor I expect.  I do recommend this product as well as pruchasing it from Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner as always."
"Not as tasty as traditional Rosarita beans but, duh, these are fat-free so I'm not surprised. (I decided to try these because they're half the price.) I also noticed I have more gas when I eat these. (Sorry for being so candid, but someone might find this helpful.) I don't notice a problem with regular beans. I do like Rosarita overall because of the great texture, but I won't buy fat-free again."
"I agree with all the other reviews, this is my favorite wheat-free, corn-free pasta.  I tried a couple of different brand of plain brown rice pasta, but they were soggy and blah.  It must be the millet that makes this pasta more firm; it's the closest I've found to a traditional wheat pasta.  My husband and daughter even like it!  It's the only pasta I buy now."
"Tastes great (like regular pasta). Cooks within 8 minutes.  Use same day, very grainy if reheated next day.  This is a gluten free product.  This also works well for those who are following Eat Right 4 Your Type Diet (O)."
"I've tried many kinds of gluten-free pasta, but this is the best I've encountered. The texture is most like ""normal"" pasta and it stands up to microwave re-heating (leftovers). No one who has had it that isn't GF can tell the difference. The flavor is great!"
We are a pasta loving family but when my son had to go on a special diet it was hard to find a brand of noodle that was approved by the diet and still tasted good. When we tried this product we were excited because it really did the trick and we can finally go back to making our favorite pasta dishes using these great noodles.  Thanks Orgran!
"My sister-in-law calls this ""pearl pasta"".  She is an amazing cook and loves this Israeli Couscous so much that she hoards it.  I will never again let an occasion go by without buying more of this for her.  She was so thrilled!"
"my family and I love this Israeli couscous (also called ""pearl""). It cooks up wonderfully and quickly and provides a nice side - the kids love it. I just season with a little basil olive oil or something similar after it's cooked."
"I love this couscous... Giada's recipe on the Food Network ""Israeli Couscous with Apples, Cranberries, and Herbs"" is my favorite to prepare. The link is [...]<br /><br />I just had friends over for dinner and sent them each home with a container of this couscous as well as the recipe. Ordering on Amazon is such a breeze that I am never have to worry about running out of this delicious product!"
This came quickly and it is such a great product.  I cook up this couscous at least once a week!  Love it!
"Smooth and easy transaction. First time eating these.  Great tasting rye berries. I use a rice cooker to cook up a weeks batch  i add to my morning oatmeal and sometimes snack on during the day to add that unique chewy and satisfying texture.  Great way to get in an excellent natural fiber source and nutrient dense yet tasty grain.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Z55EKO"">Small Simple Changes to Weight Loss and Weight Management</a>"
"I have just discovered Rye Berries and love them.  I mix them with quinoa to make a salad or breakfast cereal, and they are great to add to salads.  No additives - just good plain food."
"Been having some issues sleeping... I looked online just searching for sleep remedies and teas, I came across this drink online I ordered a 12 pack. WOW!!! Slept like a rock and no morning sugar hangover, this grape flavored relaxation beverage is the new deal.<br /><br />WILL BE BUYING MORE!"
"This is good stuff.  I love to drink it and relax.  No hangover next day, nice sleeping.  Not sweet.<br /><br />I drink this now frequent and it is just an incredible product.  Will purchase more."
I love my sleep and nap time.  Especially because I work night shift as a nurse.  Working nights I have to sleep during the day which is near impossible with the sun beeming on me.  With one can of Koma I just knock the hell out.  Love this drink.  =)
"I was a little skeptical.  Plus I'm not a fan of drinking a soda or anything like that before going to bed.  But I'll drink one after work in the evening and it just gets my body ready for bed.  All in all, I have been noticing an improved sleep cycle.  I think its a big help to relax after a long day."
"I had ordered this for my spring break for when my boyfriend came into town, just because I thought it would be a nice little treat for him. Turns out they used to sell Shin everywhere in WA. I had never known because they don't in MI. So when he saw me pull this out of the bag, he started flipping out in excitement. ""SHIN!!!!!""<br /><br />I let him cook it the way he likes it, and I must say, this soup is better than Maruchan's. Hands down. I would order this again in the future. I highly recommend it, especially if you like spicy things."
MMM I like this noodles real nice soup. Its well spicy and is just liek real soop from back hmoe. I love spicy shin bowl noodles soup well nice. Byebye
"I've tried a few brands of coconut milk since I have started cooking Thai-style curries, and, so far, I like Roland the best.  It's organic, it tastes great, and it has the full fat content, which I prefer.  If you're looking for a good, full-fat coconut milk, give it a try.<br /><br />Ingredients: organic coconut milk, water, guar gum (thickener)."
"I use coconut milk on my low-carb diabetic, dairy-free diet to make whey shakes (sweetened with steveia), cocoa, and coffee as a creamer.  I even make coconut milk yogurt with it.  I have used the usually top-rated brands of both Mae Ploy and Chaokoh but both have preservatives I would like to avoid.<br /><br />This arrived today and I immediately make a shake for lunch, and it is my favorite...very fresh tasting, more ""coconutty,"" thick (not as thick as the two mentioned above, but thick enough).  I use the whole can, add one can of water to make a quart.  I love that it's just coconut milk, water, and guar gum.<br /><br />Since I use so much of it daily and I use Prime Shipping, the savings on the automatic ordering help me out a lot.  Umm...now to make some coconut milk yogurt with this."
"This coconut milk is delicious and a real bargain for organic!!!  I use 2 or 3 cans a week of organic coconut milk because I use it in smoothies and like to drink it plain also or pour it over cereal.  I pour the contents of the can into a glass quart container, then fill it the rest of the way with water, shake it up, and put in the fridge.  When it gets cold, it is nice and thick again!  This is the only milk I drink because I don't do cow's milk and I no longer do soy milk either."
"This coconut milk is much better and more consistent than Thai Kitchen.  We use it for homemade ice cream, and it makes a far better product.  The price is right, and it's organic to boot!"
"We see why people like this brand of coconut milk.  We like it, too.  It is organic and does have guar gum (which is a food derived, natural ingredient), but it DOES NOT have chemicals/preservatives, which are bad for you.  It is thick and creamy when slightly warmed, has a strong coconut flavor and tastes better than the brands with added preservatives.  (We've tried a lot of them!)  The ingredients are coconut milk, water, guar gum---that's it!  I DO wish it said what percentage of coconut milk was in the can, some brands do, but other than that, we are happy with this brand.  It DOES NOT have an expiration date printed on the can (we wish it did).  The price is more than the brands with preservatives, which I don't understand, I wish it were lower, but if we want food with no preservatives/added chemicals, I guess this is what our option is.  Hopefully, the price will come down.  What we don't like is the shipping--9 out of 24 cans in the case were severely or moderately dented, which means we had to use them soon or immediately (not happy at all about that).  However, we will order this brand again.  UPDATE:  Ordered second case, case was shipped ""as is"", broke open during shipping, all 24 cans arrived severely or moderately dented.  Can't even open most of them with a can opener.  Completely unusable and not safe to use.  Unless packing for shipping changes, even though we love the product, we will not order again. Not happy about that, as we can't find a source to purchase locally.  UPDATE:  Contacted Amazon, they sent another case, better packing, only 2 cans minor dented.  Thank you, Amazon!  Will try purchasing again, as we love this stuff!"
"I bought this as a milk alternative for making homemade ice cream because of dairy issues on my part. I have not been disappointed! It adds the fat for creaminess that almond milk does not (the good kind of fat, mind you!), and it tastes great. My husband loves it as creamer in his coffee, and it makes tasty smoothies in the blender. I highly recommend this product and will buy it over and over again."
"I purchased this case of coconut oil from Amazon and this review is no reflection about them, it is more directed at the company Roland. I was exited to get this product and when it did come, it was in Roland's Box which was then inside of Amazon's box. So I realized that Roland's has their product already packed for Amazon to ship. After opening the box, all cans were dented and none were in good shape. I had to throw out 6 of the 24 cans because some of the dents were far more severe then the rest. With that said, I need to express how wonderful this milk is to use for smoothies and cooking. It has an amazing flavor with full fat. I lost 6 pounds since using it, without changing a thing in my diet or exercise. I use it for cooking veggies and in pancakes etc. But most of all I use it in my smoothies. I take one can which is 14 Oz and then pour in a quart mason jar, then I fill the remainder of the space up with purified water. It works out to 1/2 cup of milk equals 100 calories and about 1 Tablespoon of Oil fat from the coconut. I thought this was important because in Fife's book it is recommended that adults take approximately 3 Tablespoons a day for most weights and for very petite persons it is about 2 1/2 Tablespoons a day. So with that said, I use 1/2 cup of coconut milk in two separate smoothies a day which gives me 2 Tablespoons and then I cook with coconut oil to get the remainder that I need to get my quota or I use it directly on my skin. I feel totally different and I literally feel my cells coming to life.. My daughter suffers from horrible cycle pains of her monthly and after taking this for only 3 weeks her next cycle she was nearly pain free, It is truly a miracle for she suffered from disabling pain for years now and nothing helped her.<br /><br />I truly recommend this product, I also recommend Coconut Oil from Nutiva (extra virgin) for it is the purest one I have found yet on the market.<br /><br />For me I use it for my gallbladder issues. It has saved me much pain for I cannot take in any type of dairy or meats of any kind. I am trying to dissolve my stones by myself rather then opting for operation which can cause so many problems after surgery, not to mention the gallbladder has more uses then what is normally stated by docs.. Anyway, I use the coconut milk as 1/2 cup then add water to the blender to bring to the 8oz mark and then add 5 ice cubes. After this I add 1/2 cup raw organic beets cut up and then 1 cup of cucumbers, both these are amazing for gallbladder problems but not just that, they are amazing to cleanse your liver as well. Then I add 1 cup or more of greens to the blender, and 1/2 banana, a few cherries, or 1/2 strawberries, 5 blueberries, 5 blackberries or other berries, and any other veggie I can think of and blend with a Dr.Mercola Miracle Whey which has medium chained fatty acids just like coconut milk and wow, it is so delicious and what a way to get your veggies in... Dr.Mercola's products have no sugar but use of stevia..<br /><br />Anyway, I feel totally different and could not live without this stuff..<br /><br />If ONLY Roland's would find a way to have the product shipped to them without the damage of the cans.. This is a dangerous thing, for poisoning could take place. I'm sure its in the travel that it takes to get here to the U.S but their cans just roll around in the box, there is no padding what so ever.. So I guess I am saying that a person must realize they will or could lose more then a half dozen cans when it gets to you.. Someone should talk to the company about this. Other then that I think this product is much better then any other coconut milk on the market and I still do recommend it highly."
"I'd never tasted coconut milk and made the purchase because so many of the recipes in a recent cookbook purchase required coconut milk. I chose the Roland Coconut Milk based on the reviews and because it is organic. Well, I received my order a week ago and while I've not used the milk in any recipes, I'm hooked. I followed the advice of other reviewers and dilute the milk with a can of water and store in a glass quart pitcher. The only mishap was that I first used cold purified water so the milk wasn't smooth. In recent batches I heat the purified water to room temperature or a little warmer and then mix it with the milk. I've found the consistency to be much better.<br /><br />Also, many reviewers reported that some of the cans in their shipment were dented or otherwise damaged. The company must have corrected this issue because mine arrived in a tight fitting box with no damage."
Great item!  Definitely go with organic and don't but 'lite' types.  You can  the add water yourself-why pay the same for half the product.  Nice generous amount of cream-even more so than some more expensive brands.  Excellent for drinking when mixed with 1/2 to 3/4 can of water and a little vanilla.  (Thickens when refrigerated.)  Even good in coffee or cereals instead of milk.
"I ordered this coconut milk (24 cans!) before and loved it ... lots of creamy coconut fat that was as delicious in my morning cup of coffee as it was in curry dishes.  I didn't hesitate to order again, but will have to try another brand next time.  Multiple cans were dented on arrival, and every single can we've opened has contained a thin watery liquid (with less ""substance"" than skim milk!) with a small, hard, waxy piece of solid mass that can't even be broken up with a spoon. This was a very disappointing purchase."
"I agree with the two most recent reviews...I have been ordering this product through subscribe and save for about a year now and have gone through several cases of delicious creamy coconut milk. In May Amazon had a discount on this product so I ordered two cases, and so far the first few cans we have opened have been very disappointing. I too noticed a difference upon shaking the can, it was very liquidy and not at all how it used to feel. Upon opening it, there was no cream, it was very runny and looked oily. I didn't notice a bad taste with it, but it is nothing like the product I was used to. Tonight I used it to make coconut milk ice cream, and it was very gritty, not creamy, and never even froze in the ice cream maker like it used to (it was very runny upon scooping it out). I am very disappointed in the change in this product and will be looking for a new brand."
"After reading about the effect soy products have on the thyroid system, I decided to replace my soy milk with coconut milk.  I have never been a big fan of coconut, so I was concerned I wouldn't like it.  I was really surprised.  I love it.  It tastes rich like whole cows milk but with a touch of coconut."
"I don't know how much you can write about Coconut Milk, but I will give it a shot!  This stuff is great.  Very flavorful, with a nice sublte coconut flavor, not sweet or icky thick.  I've found that with Organic Coconut Milk I have to open it with a can opener because sometimes the top gets hardened (coconut cream) and you have to scoop it out rather than pour it out.  I use a full can every morning for my protein shake.  Since using coconut milk, rather than cow's or soy my skin, hair, nails, well being have much improved.  I use coconut oil and milk daily and have noticed a significant improvement to my overall health.  I also began using coconut milk because of it's healthy benefits based on Bruce Fife's books on coconut oils.  I get a case of Roland Organic Coconut Milk (24 cans) sent to me monthly using Amazon's subscribe and save.  It is the best deal out there on the best product I have found!"
"Like many of the recent reviewers here, I was also a long-time subscriber of this coconut milk.  I can also confirm that my case originated from Sri Lanka; not Thailand like all the previous orders.  We use coconut milk weekly, so imagine my surprise to find yellow water, instead of creamy, thick, white goodness.<br /><br />Christine at Amazon was able to provide a refund, but was very non-committal about opening a work ticket for the warehouse to investigate this product.  Guess they're not going to insist Roland change suppliers.<br /><br />It was a good thing while it lasted.  Now to try to find an organic alternative... If anybody has found a decent substitute, please share."
We have recenty given up dairy products and are using this with rice milk in a very tasty combination. This coconut milk is creamy and smooth. We like that it is organic...seems to be the best we have tried. We will be ordering more of this when our supply runs out.
"Update added 8/25/10: I recently found that Roland is comparable in fat content that that of Thai Kitchen brand. I have three different brands of coconut milk on my shelf, and each one uses a different serving size...ugh! Sorry about that. It is a good milk; however, Thai Kitchen still seems to be a fuller-fat content as well as more consistent fat content than Roland. That said, for the cost savings, for many uses, it's not a big enough difference to be of concern, so I'll just keep some of both on the shelf and use Thai Kitchen for my puddings and ice creams.<br /><br />Roland Coconut Milk is a very good-quality coconut milk; however, it only has 5g fat per serving, as opposed to the 14g fat per serving in Thai brand coconut milk. I checked out the nutrition info and ingredients to be sure I was ordering something comparable, but neglected to compare fat content. Unfortunately, this milk will not be able to be used in many of the recipes I need that 14g fat/serving for."
I have to say that I looked at the high marks that this got but didn't read the recent reviews. Silly me.<br /><br />This coconut milk is thin and I don't believe as good quality as some other ones on the market.<br /><br />The tins came in a big box and at least a third were badly dented.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again and would suggest you look elsewhere for your coconut milk.
"First two times I ordered the milk was awesome.  Last time I ordered two cases they were all smashed and the milk was horrible.  I was unable to return it because amazon said it was nonreturnable. The first two times I got the milk I would have given five stars, now I would advise against buying it.  They can't even stand by their product by allowing a return on a bad batch."
"I ordered one case a number of months ago and was really impressed -- some of the best coconut milk I'd had.<br /><br />Then I received a case a couple weeks ago. I noticed it had a bit odd consistency, no cream on the top, but made a curry with it anyways, and was unable to finish it! I later tried to make a smoothie with it and almost vomited. What the hell happened to this product?<br /><br />Disappointed, and not going to order from Roland again, even if they improve -- I don't trust their quality control."
"I used to order this over a year ago on a subscribe and save basis, and was quite happy with it.  I just re-ordered it, and opened 3 of 24 cans only to find that it was watery, and smelled off.  I am definitely NOT ordering this again, and was told I could not return it to Amazon as it is a food product.  I had to beg and plead with their customer service to get a refund.  Caveat Emptor!  This is not the same great product it used to be..."
"I placed my first order for this product in March of 2011, and I was very pleased with what I received (I had never tried coconut milk before).  The coconut milk was thick and creamy.  If I didn't shake the can before opening it, there was a layer of (very tasty) cream at the top.<br /><br />I finished my first case at the end of May and decided to sign up for Amazon's subscription plan for Roland Coconut Milk.  The new case arrived very quickly, but the content of the cans was not the same.  This time, the coconut milk was watery and had a flavor I was not fond of.  There was no layer of cream at the top of the can, and it just sounded differently when I shook the can (being of much thinner consistency).<br /><br />Both products were Roland Organic Coconut Milk.  I did notice some slight differences on the cans.  The thicker, tasty, non-subscription cans were ""AUSTRALIAN CERTIFIED ORGANIC,"" had a 2004 copyright, and were a product of Thailand.  The watery cans that came with the subscription had a ""KLBD"" symbol on them, were certified by Control Union Certifications, had a 2010 copyright, and were a product of Sri Lanka.  Both cans listed the same ingredients and nutrition information.<br /><br />I should also note that I had no problem with the packaging of my first, non-subscription order.  There were very minor dents on about 1/4 of the cans, but nothing that made me consider throwing them away.  The packaging of the subscription order was a mess.  It was completely falling apart and a can fell out of the box when I picked it up.  I haven't actually opened the box, I've just slid the 2 cans I've opened out of the holes in it.  The one can that fell out was dented, but I think this was a result of the fall.  The other can was in good condition.<br /><br />If I had reviewed this product after receiving my first order, I would have given it five stars.  The lack of consistency in the product quality and the poor flavor of the 2nd order lead me to give this product a 1 star review."
"I bought this expecting it would be like my local coconut milk, but it is only half the fat and no where on Amazon did it say that.  Most of the cans are dented and I am quite disappointed.  I won't buy again."
"I have ordered this product in the past and been quite pleased with the quality; since we are dairy-free, I use a lot of coconut milk.  However, my most recent order has revealed that this coconut milk is not what it used to be.  It is watery, the coconut cream portion is hard and can't be whisked into the milk like it should be.  There is NO way you could use this coconut cream portion - it is anything but creamy.  I am so disappointed, and now I'm stuck with a whole case with limited useability and have wasted my money.  I just canceled my subscription to this item; I will not be ordering it ever again!"
"I am by no means a coconut expert but, I do know taste. Roland's coconut milk is light and creamy, with a hint of coconut. It is relatively sweetless, so if your looking for something that has very little sugar with a nice after taste, this is it. It is very smooth but the only thing which is a downer is there are tiny bits of coconut milk that have condensed. Not bad but if you don't use enough sugar it will be a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  E.A.C"
"This brand was suggested by my nutritionist because of my milk intolerance. He doesn't like the 'So Delicious' box brand because it contains carrageenan.<br /><br />I was so glad for the reviews that said this needed to be diluted. I diluted in 2 quarts of water like another reviewer suggested and used a wisk to get the solidified fat to disperse evenly. It came out so smooth and silky, I just loved it.<br /><br />I did add some simple syrup to it to make it a little sweet. Perfect!<br /><br />One can did come dented. I used that one first."
I love this milk.  I dilute it to 2 quarts and it tastes great.
COCONUT IS GO0D FOR SO MANY THINGS. THIS IS ORGANIC AND I FEEL BETTER SERVING IT THAN OTHER COCONUT MILKS.
"This coconut milk has become my favorite.  It has a slightly sweet, coconutty flavor and is very creamy.  I love that it doesn't have added sugar or preservatives.  I highly recommend it!"
"I really liked this product. I have so many cans that I don't even know what to do with them all! Each can contains coconut milk (organic) and guar gum (as a thickening agent). I wish I would've known about that extra ingredient but other than that, if you want coconut milk, this is where you should get it. Everything arrived on time and the packaging was just right. Oh by the way, it arrived on time too. :)"
"The product inside the can is very good. I use it for cooking.<br />The packaging is inadequate. Half of the cans arrived severely dented. I opened the most mis-shapen can and saw no breach in the seal of the container; so I still used it despite misgivings.<br /> I saw that Amazon does not accept return of this canned product. Also I got no request for feedback except as to the adequacy of the packaging, so I feel they must be aware of the faulty and inadequate packaging.<br /> Roland Coconut Milk, Organic, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)"
"Inside the undamaged Amazon shipping box, we found an already opened, but undamaged, 24 can Roland case container. The end had been cleanly cut from that box and then re-fitted over the opening, without being taped. Inside the Roland box were 24 damaged cans. Not a single can was not damaged in some way, the majority of them being severely dented. The sheer number of damaged cans, and the variety of that damage, in an undamaged box, was such that we concluded these were previously damaged cans collected into the case container we received. We contacted Amazon and their response was immediate and gratifying, as has always been the rule with them. As for the product itself, it is not one we would consider ordering again."
"I bought the product before and the ""coconut milk"" came out to be watery and very greasy... NOT milky at all. I complained to Roland, they told me the problematic batch I bought was from Sri Lanka, and they have stopped buying from the supplier since. They also sent me new cans, this time from Thailand. Upon opening, there's thick layer of cream at the mouth of the can, and also more thick coconut cream on the bottom of the can. After mixing the coconut cream and milk together, the result is VERY creamy and luscious! I made a variation of sweet Malaysian dessert soup, Pulut Hitam, with black rice and pumpkin, very tasty!! The warm sweet coconut soup is perfect for the cooler fall weather!"
"It seems like, no matter how long I work with this stuff, I never get used to the taste.<br /><br />I like shredded dried coconut, fresh coconut, and even the lukewarm putrid watery liquid found in the center of a coconut which is sold in high priced cans at Whole Foods, but somehow coconut milk is kind of ... whatever.<br /><br />In conclusion: Do you like free shipping? Do you like coconut milk? Do you like cans? Well here it is. And good luck."
"This is really good coconut milk. It has given some incredible flavors to dishes. But I don't need to die prematurely. With the amount of fat in these cans, this should come with a skull and crossbones on it. Toxic, but what a way to go!"
"Horribly disappointed.  The box was busted along the bottom when I received it, I had to open to see if all 24 cans were still in the box.  After opening, every can was dented, even the ones that were in the middle of the case.  I could maybe understand if the outside parameter of cans were dented. I believe from the look of this case they are sending these out of factory already damaged."
I sent to my father as a gift. His comments were it had a lot of flavor but was also fatty.
"This was ordered as a Christmas present for my boyfriend -- and he was delighted! OK, OK -- I was too -- of course I got to try some as well! Very tasty, excellent flavor, nice selection of unique salamies at a great price. Shipped very quickly and packaged very well indeed -- I've purchased glassware online that hasn't received the packaging attn that this bundle of salamies received!  Highly recommended!"
Never tried Volpi Salami before but took a chance with this 5-bundle package. No dissappointment here - each one seemed better than the other!
The Volpi Salami bundle is delicious and offered a great selection.  A small party of eight devoured it with relish and there was very little left at the end of the party.  I am buying it again and will do so every time I run out.
"I wanted these for my dog's dental care. He love rawhide and I thought these would keep him busier longer. Unfortunately, he's not a fan. Nothing against the product. It just didn't work for my dog."
My dog loves chewing on the wishbone.  The product was what I expected and the shipping was quick!
"I started my diet not eating any type of products like this, but after a while I CRAVED starches, and this took my cravings away like crazy."
"I'm afraid this smoked salmon is too mushy...too watery and bland. My cat goes crazy for it though so I guess this is going in the kitty treat section. It's not awful (I love canned tuna) but, it's definitely not like the vacuum packed smoked salmon you can buy locally which is much firmer and doesn't have a ton of water (lame).<br /><br />At least this is wild caught and it could be worse which is why I'm giving this 3 stars. This would probably be fine for a recipe but eaten on its own leaves something to be desired."
Being packed in water makes this can of Mandarin Orange segments a truly healthy treat.  They are delicious and really taste like fresh Mandarin oranges.  Use them in deserts or on chicken or anything that requires a mild orange flavor.  I will buy this canned fruit again.  I highly recommend it to every one.
"These mandarin oranges are extraordinary.  First, packed in water, they taste like real oranges, not like sugared soda with fiber in it.  Second, juicy and flavorful, they're great for adding to yogurt or cereal in the morning, eating as a side dish or dessert at any meal, or adding to delicious salads or stir-fries.  Third, they're so good that, when I'm craving cookies or a chocolate bar, instead I eat these oranges right out of the can and feel completely satiated!  I now keep extra cans plus a can opener in the car and grab one whenever too much time on the road is prompting me to think that a quick swing through a fast-food drive-in line might be appropriate.  :)  Drink the juice, too:  it keeps you hydrated and has many fewer calories than straight fruit juice, since there's so much water.  A lovely, refreshing snack, a sort of fruit-flavored water with extra fiber and great mouth feel!  :)<br /><br />When the first case of 24 arrived, I was a little perturbed.  So many?  and how long would it take me to finish them?  I was thinking years...  but now, after 2 weeks, they're almost gone, and I'm worried because they're no longer in stock.  Will Amazon get more in time to fill my next order in only 2 weeks???  A case of 24 is starting to look awfully small indeed.<br /><br />(I shouldn't be telling you all how good they are -- you'll just be competing with me for the limited number Amazon seems to stock!)  :)"
"Who needs sugar or syrup to cover up the real fruit taste of juicy mandarin oranges? We were pleased to find this product and enjoy the quality of the large firm segments.  Once we tasted the pure unadulterated fruit we realized that most of the sugared up versions were masking or dressing up their lower quality pieces of fruit.<br /><br />Recommended not just for those who need to watch their sugar intake, but for any concerned with eating for health and taste."
What a great find! I am addicted to mandarin oranges and eat them nightly and love that a whole can of these only have 135 calories vs. 300 or more like the other brands with heavy syrup or even light syrup. There is also no added sweetener so you can sweeten them with the sweetener of your choice if you choose to do so. They are delicious just as they are but sometimes when I am craving something really sweet I will add a little Splenda. These are good quality mandarin oranges and I am about to buy my second case! This comes out to about the same price I pay for mandarin oranges at the grocery store only these arrive at my door! Can't beat it!
"Horrible typical metallic tasting Product of China.  Would not have ordered if I had known they were a Product of China.  Have not been able to find Mandarin oranges not a Product of China. Reported the problem to Amazon and they gave me an instant refund (thank you, Amazon) and I threw the case out.  What a waste of food."
"Purchased this because of the special offer from Amazon (4-for-3.)  When I received them in the mail, I was surprised at how small they were.  Each sliver seems to be about 1/3 the size of the pig ears I used to buy.  But each bag weighs a bit over 16 oz / 1 lb (bag included, I'm guessing about 14-15 oz of actual ears.)  So compared to what I used to buy at Wal-Mart, this is a pretty good discount.<br /><br />Oh, and the dog (terrier) seems to like them alright - and I'm pretty sure that's what actually matters."
one of these will keep my puppy busy and content for hours...great for puppies during their chewing stage
"Overall, I'm pleased with the quality of these chews. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a number of the strips are cut in such a way that they have sharp slender points. I have 2 Springer Spaniel pups that love these things so much that they try to gulp them down without much chewing. I keep a close eye on my pups while they eat these chews to ensure that they don't get caught in their throats. We have had one get caught in the roof of the mouth. I sometimes smash the points with a hammer just for my own peace of mind. The dogs love 'em. I have to keep them in the laundry room because they can smell them (I can't) if I keep them in the kitchen which leads to begging and pawing."
"We own two dogs who are drastically different in sizes. I've always preferred the slivers because my smaller dog can manage them better, and I pick out the larger pieces for my bigger dog. I normally get them from the pet store but needed an extra item to add to my order to put it over 25 bucks ( yay for free shipping ). The price is cheaper here than I normally pay and my smaller dog, who is WAY more picky seems to like these better than the ones from the pet store we shop at. The size of the slivers are more constant as well. There are still some bigger than others but none of the tiny crumbs of pieces you can sometimes find in other brands.<br /><br />Overall if my dogs are happy with them, I am happy with them and they seem to be. Plus the price is great just another bonus."
"I have a Lab and a Boxer and got these for them since they love pig ears. After a couple of days they both got sick and had allergic reactions. Swelling, raw snouts - always rubbing on the ground - lethargic. So I went to the vet thinking they were sick from something else. She said the pig ears did it! Said she has seen this before with cheap ones. These were much greasier than local bought ones too. Too bad, it was a good price."
"We have tiny dogs. The kind that fit in a woman's purse (sheeeeeze, that's what the wife wanted, grin) Anyway, we were looking for ""slivers"" of pig's ears not ""slices"". The slices are probably great for medium to large dogs, but they were too big for our tiny dogs.<br /><br />Good product for a fair price. Just think ""Slices"" not ""Slivers""."
These strips keep both of my toy dogs busy for hours. What I liked about this brand is that it had decent sized pieces and no unusable shreds at the bottom of the bag. I will definitely try some of the other products this brand offers.
"My puppy absolutely loves these! I do recommend watching your pup/dog while they eat these just to make sure they aren't trying to swallow a big piece of it, and not give it too often as it is fattening. But it does make for a delicious, yummy treat!"
"My dog who is very fussy about her treats, absolutely loved these.  They aren't the skimpy little chips that other brands offer and they weren't the full blown ears which my dog doesn't need to gobble down every time I give her a treat. It is a great product and we will be ordering again.  Can you get this on subscribe and save?"
"These piggy silvers are good but my dogs preferred Moo tube, tendons, and lungs over these! They have little smell and a bit greasy (like other pig ears.) Great for non-picky, moderate chewers."
"I have a 25# dog, who loves pigs ears type treats.  Problem is that all the ones I find in the store are way to big for him (I think so, but not surprisingly, he doesn't :-) ).  These chews are just the right size and he loves them.  Can't go wrong."
The small dog loves these treats. But they are super fatty and hard for small dogs to eat.
We have a Mini Schnauzer who loves these things.  These are great for dogs in which a full pigs ear is too much for one sitting.  I use these as a treat for my dog whenever I am going somewhere and she will have to stay in her cage.  These are always gone by the time I get home and she gets right in her cage without a fight because she knows she will get one.  I think these would be a huge waste for a medium to large dog as they would finish them so quickly.
"YOU CAN GET A BETTER VALUE....<br /><br />I bought these thinking they were something they turned out to not be. I guess I wanted the regular sized pig ears that I am accustomed to.<br /><br />24 of these ears= about 8 regular sized Pig ears. That may be a generous ratio to give.<br /><br />So all in all in my opinion there are better deals for this type of item...<br /><br />So where do I get my dogs pig ears--<br /><br />ALDI grocery store--- they have a company ""SHEP"" that produces some dog items for that chain of stores.<br /><br />About $3 or $4 buys you 5 regular (LARGE) pig ears. A real great deal- dogs love them."
"After reading the reviews here about made in China, I was pleased to find that they must have been mistaken, ..... that the product is clearly labeled, Made In USA.<br /><br />The product is fun for the dog, I have a 3 lb chihuahua, and he loves them.  They are varying sizes, I'm sure ANY size dog could enjoy them.  My worry is that they are VERY pointy - sharp as a knife.  I watch him very carefully.  I have also filed down some of the points with a commercial metal file.  That was an easier option for me than returning, no matter how easy Amazon returns are, I hate to have to return things.<br /><br />I see other Smokehouse products that I can try instead, so all in all I'm happy with the Manufacturer and the product quality.<br /><br />So, while I give the product 5 stars for flavor and appeal, being made in USA, quality fresh when received - I have to deduct 2 stars for having to file down points.<br /><br />For those that want a list of dog-treat/food Companies that are certified MADE IN USA, check this website: [...] and then find the area that is dog-made-in-the-usa.  On the left, they have two brand lists, the top list is for the USA page, refine by company, etc.  Click see more to see the entire list - - the ones they carry that are NOT made in the USA are grayed out.  NOT made in USA, those include Beefeaters and Busybuddy!!!!  - much to my surprise.  I could have sworn Beefeaters said it had it's facilities FDA and HACCP certified on their About Us on their website.  That would say to me that they are USA, but no where on their site does it actually state Made in USA, so hmmmm.  Guess it's good to investigate."
More jerky that is made in China. Unknowing owners are feeding this potential killer to their loved pets. Please research dog treats you feed your pets before you end up heartbroken and with high vet bills.
"THE GOOD:  My Lab loves these.  They are slivers not the whole ear which is easier for my old dog to chew on.<br /><br />THE BAD:  It would be better if the bag would be a zip-lock type - but they don't last long.  So that really is not a big con.<br /><br />OVERALL:  a good purchase, would buy another."
"I have a 8 month old mixed (mutt) poodle that current weighs in at about 15 pounds. The package arrive while the dog was outside. I took a piece out and placed it in the dog's bed. When I let the dog back in, it sniffed around a few seconds and then made a bee line for the bed. I swear, this little dog acts as if these pig slivers are treats.<br /><br />Good enough for me to recommend them. :)<br /><br />Ken"
"So far none of the 'chew' items I've found anywhere give my 2 crazy dogs any significant chew time...they just eat them in about a minute and a half (same thing for those huge expensive 'rawhide bones'.)  I guess I need smaller dogs, but meanwhile my 2 canine cannibals love these...so more are in the re-order hopper.<br />Sigh."
"I was a bit surprised as some of the reviews here complained about the size. While not nearly as big as a standard pig ear, these make great tasty treats for my 60lb dogs. Much larger than I thought and I'm going to order a bunch more. Great price and product. A big 'Paws Up' from my two Boxers!"
"My pomeranian puppy is teething, and she loves these! They are the perfect size for her, literally slivers not full ears. This is fine for her because she can't choke on them. I would get real pig ears for a bigger dog though."
"The product is very economical, as far as pig ears go. If you have a large dog or are really wanting to keep your dog busy for a while, get the whole pig ear. Our terrier puppy finishes the strips pretty quickly, but our older Sheltie likes the strips better than a full pig ear."
"I like these because they are not too big, so the bag lasts a little longer. My dogs love them. Price is pretty reasonable too."
"This is the 2nd time I have purchased these dog treats.  Our 8 month old puppy, (toy poodle and bichon mix), just loves them.  We also give them to dogs of different sizes that belong to other family members and they love them, too.  Next time I will order the bigger bag.  We are going through them a lot quicker this time!  I am so glad I found these on Amazon."
"wow these treats are the best my 2 Labradors love them!! i purchased these for the 3rd time now and i must say they come exactly like the first time. they are perfect for dogs that love biting crunchy foods and its made in the usa so i know im giving my dogs real pork not an imitation from china my dogs love em and if they could speak they would say ""keep 'em coming""! i recommend this product to any dog owners out there looking for treats to give their companions"
"Yes, it will work for my GSD puppy. It will keep him occupied for 15 minutes, enough to distract him when kids are having food. :-)"
"Our 4-mo old terrier is teething so she really lives up to her breed's rep. I got these after reading the reviews on Amazon, and our pup loves them. She goes off by herself and gnaws on one strip for about 30-40 min. We can clean the house, do laundry in another room, and eat dinner in peace with these silvers. It's almost like magic!<br /><br />It is very greasy and there is definitely a smoky-sort of scent to these things. I think that's why she likes it. I hide a silver in one of her toys, and can leave the house without her even noticing that I'm gone. Highly recommended if your dog is teething, a terror (sorry, terrier!), and likes crunchy smelly treats!"
WE HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE FOR YEARS.  OUR 11 YEAR OLD BOXER/ROTTWEILLER LOVES EM JUST AS MUCH AS THE FIRST TIME HE TASTED THEM.
my french mastiff  is fussy about her treats. she will not eat all but she loves these slivers
My dogs go crazy for these little pig ear strips.  They start dancing around as soon as I pick up the package.
Amazon has the best price I have found for this treat that my dog absolutely loves!
These are the perfect size for my pomeranians. 1 piece is about 1/3 the size of regular pig ears. My dogs love the taste. I love that they were made in the USA and not some other country!<br /><br />Buy American!!!
My dog loves them.  Even in slivers they are big enough for my over 100lbs dog.  We used to buy whole pig ears and it's pretty messy because my dog crushed the whole ear and tiny shreds were every where.
"My new mini dachshund pup chewed everything apart when I brought her home. Shoes, cords, table legs -- you name it. I got these snacks because someone told me they were great and she hasnt chewed anything since. They smell bad when they are being chewed, but its a small price to pay."
"Pig ears keep our dogs quiet for a while, but I couldn't believe how much they cost.  With three dogs, price counts.  These are slivers, not whole ears, but they are still cheaper than the grocery store.  Our dogs love them, and the little one can handle the slivers while the whole ears a little too big."
"Def. overpriced for what you receive.  Dogs loved them but no benefit in buying them online, better off buying it at the store."
"If you look at my reviews, you will see that I love buying treats for my doggies and recommend many great treats. However, these were way too hard and sharp! I was a bit worried when I gave them to my doggies, and it turned out that I was right to be worried, because my terrier mix broke a tooth which needs to be extracted now. Buyer beware!"
"Gave my dog ""Severe"" diarrhea, and cost me a Big vet bill to find that Pork/Turkey... products can be as toxic as chocolate! Can kill smaller dogs!<br /><br />My vet also didn't like the chicken jerky treats mfg in China (Google it!)!<br /><br />""Below is the ASPCA's list of 13 foods that are bad for your dog<br /><br />Alcoholic beverages Can cause intoxication, coma and death.<br />Avocado Its high fat content can lead to Pancreatitis.<br />Chocolate (all forms) Contains caffeine, theobromine or theophylline which can be toxic to the heart and nervous system.<br />Coffee (all forms) Contains caffeine which can be toxic to the heart and nervous system.<br />Fatty foods Can cause Pancreatitis.<br />Macadamia nuts Contains toxins which can affect the muscles, digestive system, and nervous system.<br />Moldy or spoiled foods Could contain multiple toxins<br />Onions, onion powder Contains sulfoxides and disulfides which can damage red blood cells, resulting in anemia.<br />Raisins and grapes Contains toxins which can damage kidneys, cause kidney failure and lead to death.<br />Salt Can cause electrolyte imbalance if eaten in suffient quantities.<br />Yeast dough (Unbaked) Can expand in digestive system and cause bloat, leading to death.<br />Garlic Similar to onions (above) except garlic is considered to be less toxic and safe for dogs when used in moderation.

This is an adorable pez dispenser. A great collectors item for beagle lovers and pez collectors alike. More of a novelty item than a well functioning treat dispenser.
"Cutest PEZ dispenser ever!. PEZ is quite large (8 inches tall), but holds only 6 ""bones."" More of a novelty item than a practical tool. Do love it, plan on buying another for my friend!"
I got this for my neighbor for a Christmas gift. It was the cutest thing I had seen. It seems to be well made and the treats went in easily. She really loved it and couldn't wait to take it to work to show all of her friends what her dog got for Christmas since we had never seen anything else like this. It is a unique gift!
"Waste of money!  Doesnt work, my dog isnt even too fond of the treats! save your money and get something else.<br />It is pretty cute to look at for me, but doggie wasnt interested."
"While looking online for bulk organic loose-leaf tea, I came across this brand and pouch size here on Amazon.  It's the lowest cost I found, especially for an organic tea.  I can't vouch for its use in IBS, not having that problem myself, but I know that the oil content is very good, and the flavor is reasonable - a bit coarse and slightly bitter, but definitely palatable.  It's soothing and relaxing, settles my stomach, and opens my nasal passages.<br /><br />I have two recommendations when using this tea:<br /><br />1. Use a BUNCH of it; be generous with the amount of leaves when brewing.<br /><br />2. Use quite hot but /not/ boiling water to brew; when I boiled a teapot of water and then right away poured it on the leaves, I vaporized the essential oil."
"Very flavorful. Really helps IBS symptoms. Does NOT irritate the stomach or esophagus for people who also have acid reflux. [But all peppermint relaxes the spincter between the two, so pay attention to it's effect on you.]<br /><br />To make a big batch of ICED TEA....use 2 tablespoons per cup of boiling water, steep for 7 mins., add honey to taste, strain it into a container with an equal amount of ice and pour yourself a cup! Yum!"
"Potent peppermint tea. Great price. Be sure to purchase a tea tin to store in, we forgot. Most containers at the stores are either too small or have clear sides or lids."
"This mint tea is delicious! The smell is fantastic and yes - it is stronger than what you'd expect. I have tried all sorts of mint teas and this is my favorite. Also, the bag is HUGE! I was expecting a decent size bag but this was just amazing. I suspect I'll be drinking mint tea for months. Luckily, I drink it daily. Worth every penny!"
"I been a customer of this product for 3 years, excellent company and excellent tea, fresh and it shipped promtly. Owner answers her own telephone. I use it with my electric tea maker from Sunbeam. I love their teas and all their products."
"Not only is this tea delicious, it helps calm my stomach and intestines. I drink it first thing in the morning when my IBS is the worst. I also drink it throughout the day and before I go to bed. It really is the best peppermint tea that I have tried."
"I am impressed with the quality of this product and will definitely be ordering more. I used to grow and harvest my own, but since I have moved to the tropics and now buy it, I have been disappointed until now.  Think I found my new supply."
"Great Price, Potent and Tasty!  This is my second purchase. I use the hot water off my 5 gallon water cooler to make a cup.  You can steep this tea a couple of times and still have a great cup of tea.  This is a LOT of tea, make sure you purchase a nice container that doesn't let light in and seals well.  Great for people who suffer with IBS. Highly recommend."
"1 lb. Gees that's a lot of tea, stronger peppermint then any prebaged tea. And I put two tablespoons of this tea in my coffee filter hummmmm peppermint coffee! I will be buying this product over and over"
This tea is great. I drink some every day and it keeps my tummy happy and my spirits uplifted. The aroma is very nice. The size of the bag is enormous! I have never seen such a large bag of loose leaf tea!
"Great tea for stomach problems, and it's very fresh and well packaged. I would recommend this tea from Heather's Tummy Teas."
This is a great P-mint tea that has a great flavor and aroma.  I have found this tea to be better than others of similar cost.  I'm sticking with this tea.
I was looking for a good loose leaf peppermint tea.  A lot of previous reviews of this product lauded its minty-ness.  They weren't kidding!  It's great tea and very minty.  And the bag is huge!  Definitely worth the price.
"Pro's:<br /><br />The BEST peppermint tea I've had<br />Organic<br />The best preservation of oils I think I've seen in any tea. It can nearly burn your nose after brewing with the fullness of its flavor.<br /><br />Con's:<br />NONE. I used to buy Teavana's, but stopped after the recall for Salmonellae...  now I just buy this stuff. It tastes like liquid gold down the throat and helps with stomach problems. It is my daily IBS medicine and I do great now! I never tire of peppermint tea! I wish they'd branch out into other mint teas as well."
"This is a great herbal tea- what I love most about it is you can drink it pretty much 24/7 due to the fact it has no caffeine.  The flavor and aroma is very strong, the tea seems right off the plant fresh.  It provides great relief from stomach discomfort.  GREAT PRICE!"
"My local tea shop ran out of strong bulk peppermint tea, and the replacement just didn't cut it, so I went looking. After a few other orders that had to be shipped back, I encountered Heather's Tummy Teas and decided to give it a try. Wow, this is just what I was looking for! Strong and yummy. I don't have IBS, so I can't comment on its effectiveness for that condition, but I do have a love for the strong taste of peppermint and this fills the bill at a decent price!"
"This is a lot of tea!  I like having the ability to make a large pot of tea for the day.  It seems to be a good quality.  It's not as ""minty"" as the tea bags I was buying from the grocery store but I have gotten used to it pretty quick. It works wonders on my stomach and IBS.  I don't go a day without it."
"This is one of the best peppermint teas I have ever tasted.  It is much stronger than the bag teas you will find in local grocery stores.  I purchased it to help calm my IBS and it really does a good job of calming the GI.  My only complaint is that I wish the bag was resealable.  I had to purchase a tea canister because you cannot keep it in this bag without loosing the effects of the tea.  If you want really strong tea, then (in my opinion) follow the package directions.  I have had to water it down a bit because the peppermint oil is a bit too strong for my system.  The bag is huge and a little really goes a long way.  I am sure this will last for several months.  Be sure to by a nice tea infuser - this is the best way to enjoy this tea.  I purchased the Adagio Teas Personal sized tea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket and it is working well."
"This has been my yummy summer treat as part of my iced tea creations I've been making with my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J5FN48"">Mr. Coffee TM70 3-Quart Iced-Tea Maker</a>. This is the most potent mint flavor you are likely to experience. I use this as part of a mix with either <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0IS"">Eco Teas Organic Yerba Mate, Loose, 16-Ounces (Pack of 3)</a>or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OFJ79S"">Bigelow® Lemon Ginger Herb Plus Probiotics (Box of 18)</a> most of the time. But I'm still experimenting.<br />I can't address how this product works for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.<br />I can say though that the difference between this and any other mint tea I've encountered so far is dramatic. This is some of the tastiest stuff in the world. I don't see myself willing to be without this product."
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother, who has a terrible time finding good assortments of decaf tea.  She called me just the other day and asked me where I found it, because she had already tried 3 or 4 different varieties and loves them all.  I highly recommend Davidson's tea, and will definitely be making future purchases from them."
Bought this as a gift for friends and they haven't stopped raving about the wonderful variety of teas included.  Hard to find all decafinated teas in one package and so this was perfect with 12 different varities.
"This is about my 10th wine kit, and it went smoothly. This is a good value kit, not a top quality one. It hasn't aged yet, but is already quite good. In about 6 months or a year it will be a good table wine. It comes with everything you need except for the fermentation equipment."
"This wine kit is one of 5 Vino Italiano kits I've made. These cheaper kits give you a quick turnaround with a decent wine(a lighter variety than the better kits produce-a little less balanced). So far the whites have tasted better to me.  The first 3 kits were made as to instructions, with the next 2 (Pinot Biano and Rosso Magnifico) I reduced the water added to make about 5.25 gals of of must and racked off into a 5 gal carboy. Don't know what to expect but will follow up this review. I did notice that the reduced water version takes much longer to degas."
"These treats are reasonably priced, high quality, and great for training. The ones on the bottom can be crumbly but it's handy that they're easy to break up. All of our (four) dogs love them :)."
"I had such high hopes for this tea, but it is bland and despite it's claim to be strong, still required two tea bags to be strong and dark enough for me.  It lacks the delicious malty flavor that Yorkshire Gold has."
"This product is easier to use than any other aspartame product I have found.<br />It is bulk packed and in a concentrate - not in spoonful strength equal to sugar and therefore does not have the fillers that make others, including Equal Spoonful foam.<br />I use a lot of iced tea which I make in large quantity, two or so gallons at a time, and other than opening numerous packets or sweeten each glass as I use it, this is the best way to sweeten the tea I have found."
"This product can be very useful for anyone who prepares low calorie sweetened drinks in larger than single-serving amounts.<br /><br />My family and I drink a lot of iced tea. Bottled teas cost a lot and powdered tea mixes taste pretty awful, so I began to brew fresh tea one gallon at a time. Because we also prefer to avoid empty sugar calories, I was tearing open 20 little packets of Equal for each pitcher of lemon iced tea. That was tedious and I didn't like throwing away a zillion little blue paper shreds either.<br /><br />My solution? I bought this one pound bulk package of Equal. Now I just pour 20 grams of Equal into a gallon of tea (I use my kitchen scale to get the sweetness just right) and add lemon juice. Bingo! I like it better than bottled teas -- fresher-tasting, not so sweet -- and it's much cheaper, there are no empty bottles to throw away/recycle and I can serve as much tea as I want at the moment.<br /><br />One pound of Equal sounded like an awful lot for home use until I realized that we were already buying boxes of 800 Equal packets from the local big box store -- there's more than a pound of Equal in each of those boxes. One pound of bulk Equal is enough for 23 gallons of iced tea sweetened to my taste -- about 4 months worth, though obviously Your Mileage May Vary.<br /><br />Now I'm even thinking of buying Amazon.com's bulk Equal in six-packs. That would get me a better price per pound plus free shipping -- a 60% drop in price for buying a two year supply of Equal. Hmmm..."
"I recently ordered and received EQUAL (bulk pk) from Amazon.com.  It was promptly shipped & received.  It is very good, but the price is quite high."
"If you enjoy pistachios and toffee, then these toffee covered pistachios will be a taste treat.  At our home, they were the ""hit snack"" during our Christmas celebration.  EDL"
"Fiddyment Farms' products are simply amazing.  My favorite, the Butter Toffee Pistachios, which come in 1LB bags, have to be hidden from plain sight to make sure no one eats them.  Why?  Because everyone who has tried them, keep coming back for more.  My recent order came mid transit during our seasonal temperature change and thus were in bad condition.  One email to Fiddyment Farms and Adrianna from customer service took care of me.  She sent out replacement bags in advance, emailed me a prepaid shipping label for the ones I was returning, and she even sent out a sample bag of one of their other products (Mandarin Orange Pistachios) that I was inquiring about.  Don't be afraid of their shipping charges.  If you order in bulk, I usually order at least 5- 1LB bags at a time, they will discount the shipping charges.  Great products and great customer service will make me a Fiddyment Farms customer for life!  I'm warning you in advance, the Butter Toffee Pistachios are highly addictive."
"Oskri claims these are 100% fig, but they taste like they have some alcohol or something used in the manufacturing process.  Pretty miserable, if you ask me.  Also, this ad says there are 20 to a box - nope, there are 15.  I would recommend you 'try before you buy' at a retail store...and maybe just buy something there anyway!"
"If you are on a Gluten Free diet (this is basically a fig cookie without the cake) these bars are good.  107 calories, 4.3 g fiber and only 3.6g fat, it is a low fat high fiber bar.  The other nut fiber bars are excellent and taste great but I have not tried the coconut bars because at 230 calories, I might as well eat a candy bar."
13g of sugar per bar. It's too sweet to our liking. Much sweeter than the date bar. Sugar tastes artificial. It doesn't state all natural or organic on the packaging. Very tangy and dense paste. We will try the nuts variety next time.
"These ''' weren't as good (fresh?) as the ones my sister in law mailed me from Chinatown LA, but they weren't bad.  My sister in law who is Chinese, warned me that some gouji berries are fake and they have been boiled in tea and therefore the flavor used up already, and then dried again and re-sold.  I don't think that's the case with these, but they were smaller in nature than the ones my SIL sent.  All in all, not bad though.  I use them all the time in my soups and Chinese cooking.  (My husband is Chinese.)"
"The name ""beef chunks"" didn't paint a very appetizing picture but I decided to try it anyway.  To my utter delight, I found chunks of shredded pot roast in its own juices.  I did have to skim the fat off the top which was very easy.  I made stroganoff with it and the flavor of the beef is just wonderful!! It's like home made pot roast! I took half and froze the rest but, if you are feeding a family of 4, there won't be any leftovers.  I would like to find a smaller can to feed 2.  I am trying this out for my emergency supplies and it is worthy of a place in the pantry!"
"Great bread...period. When I was stationed at Thule Air Base on the Danish territorial island of Greenland, I would always see this bread placed in a large aluminum-serving tray next to the breads all of us Americans were familiar with. The Danes ran the mess hall, and most of the other infrastructure on the base, and they served many dishes that were Danish. I finally tried the thin and darker bread, and for the rest of my tour I devoured a ton of it. In the many intervening years between then and now, it was a rare treat to find it in supermarkets. Rubschlager makes other kinds, but this is my favorite, and it was the one that always sold out first. I couldn't understand why the buyers for the supermarket didn't notice the trend, and buy more of the European Whole Grain. So, I was forced to wait until the next shipment...until I found it on Amazon. Now it's always on hand for sandwiches, as dinner bread, and a quick evening healthy snack with some light health smart spread."
Paws Gourmet Kickin' Chicken is my little Shih Tzu's favorite treat.  They are little tiny treats probably used by most people as training treats.  It is what I give my pup as his everyday treat.  He LOVES them!
Great peachy candy! I used to buy them for a penny each at my neighborhood store. I remember going to the store with a $1.00 and coming home with 100 pieces of candy and these little candies were more than half of my load. I was surprised to find these..would definitely buy again!
"I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4.  Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4. Below is the gist a a review I wrote for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW"">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Cherry Pie</a> comparing it with the PURE Wild Blueberry Bar.<br /><br />When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not ""fortified"" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on the Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the PURE Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try though.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.  Stats are listed in the order I listed them in the previous sentence.<br /><br />Calories:  190, 190, 280, 210, 380<br />Total Fat:  8g, 9, 14, 13, 14  Saturated Fat:  0.5g, 1, 5, 8, 7<br />Sugars:  21g, 20, 30, 24, 0<br />Protein:  4g, 6, 4, 3, 10<br />Sodium:  0mg, 5, 140, 35, 1540 !!!<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 11, 2009  PURE has changed this bar.<br /><br />I got my regular shipment and noticed the bars came in a newly shaped box and new packaging.  Total fat went from 9g to 8g and they eliminated all sodium.  Total carbs edged up to 26g from 25g.  Protein remains 6g and calories at 190.<br /><br />The BIG CHANGE is that ""Organic Wild Blueberries"" drops from the 2nd item listed on the ingredients list to the 5th!  Blueberries are now after not only dates but walnuts, cashews and rice proein concentrate.  Bumping up the nut content would not be a bad thing, but since the total fat actually decreased and carbs increased, I think the nut quantity actually decreased along with the blueberries, but the date quantity increased.  This seems to basically be a date bar w/ nuts now and some minor blueberry content.  I'd love to see the actually quantity of blueberries in this bar.  Ironically, I can actually see blueberries scattered in the new bar, whereas the old bar was more of a dense blended mush.  The bar is noticeably lighter in color now (and density)...more tan than blue.  The new packaging implies a longer slimmer bar shape, but oddly the actual bar is shorter, wider and a tad thicker...package marketing?  The total weight is unchanged at 1.7oz.  I'm still looking for an alternative blueberry bar...I imagine cost is a big factor in blueberry content.  My 2 kids will still eat these but they noticed the change right away and are not impressed."
"This bar is the closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.  I have no idea how the folks at Pure Bar managed to make a chocolate bar that tastes so much like baked goods, using only raw and living ingredients, but it's wonderful that they have, and I mean to buy several more cases.  Any of the store bought brownies you've had won't satisfy you like this will - Entemanns and Hostess are not nearly as delicious and warm-tasting, and the health food and energy bars I've had that are chocolate flavored always end up tasting like wheat germ or oats.  It's easy to carry, one bar fills me up, and as a chocolate fan, I am happy to see that Pure Bar uses raw cacao powder - the real deal, and not carob chocolate substitutes.  You can definitely taste the difference.  This particular Pure Bar product makes for the best tasting snackfood or dessert I've ever eaten out of a wrapper, and unless you're on a completely raw vegan diet, it's going to be better for you than whatever meal you ate just beforehand!  If you like chocolate like I do, you're going to love this.  It's a soft, gooey brownie, pure and simple, walnuts and all."
"Allow me to give you some frame of reference on me:  I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian, or sufferer of Celiac Disease.  If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star.  But since I'm not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I'll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.<br /><br />The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn't have a chemistry degree can understand it.  That in itself is refreshing.  They've even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:<br /><br />YES!:  Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, Vegan<br /><br />NO!:  Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin'<br /><br />WOW!  5-STARS SO FAR!  Let's tear this thing open!<br /><br />At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that's been mashed with a rolling pin.  Mmmmm...  Maybe that's why it doesn't need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future.  Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.  I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone.  (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don't count the kids' outright rejection.)<br /><br />The first bite redeemed the bar.  It's tastier than I'd anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary.  I think I might like this.<br /><br />The second bite lost the other star instantly.  I felt like I almost broke a tooth on a rather large fruit pit.  Guess I should have paid closer attention to the disclaimer on the wrapper that states, ""May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.""  I found a stem in the other half of the bar.<br /><br />As good as this fruit bar may be for me, I don't think I should have to strain it prior to eating it.  I have enjoyed similarly nutritious bars in the past and not one thought of seeking a dentist.<br /><br />Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all), I'll probably do some more ""research"" (read: taste tests) on other healthy snack bars before buying a case.  I will, however, recommend this bar to a family member who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I've sampled.<br /><br />Just be careful and take small bites."
"The best part about this bar is that (unlike most others) I cannot taste the dates.  They're a little sweet, but not too much so; the tartness of the cherries helps balance things out.  I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.  I'm new this whole raw food thing, so these have been life-savers for when I'm tired of eating whole foods and salads."
"I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured ""right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are"". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like ""granola"" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next..."
"I love these bars.  I basically live off of them.  HOWEVER, this is now the second time that I have ordered them from Amazon where the internal boxes of bars have had bugs in them.  They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.  Thank g-d Trader Joes and Ralphs are starting to carry this brand."
"As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain ""nothing cooked, nothing processed,"" but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains ""agave nectar"" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a ""healthy alternative"" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don't understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this ""raw"" bar, and second, they used ""agave nectar"" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used ""agave nectar"" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.<br /><br />You can research for yourself, google ""agave nectar bad""<br /><br />and look for entries from ""foodrenegade,"" ""nourishedkitchen"" and ""living-foods""<br /><br />You can also google ""fructose bad""<br /><br />check out the hits from ""about"" and ""the american journal of clinical nutrition""<br /><br />Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you're in, ""agave nectar"" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims ""nothing cooked and nothing processed"" is nothing short of fraud."
"Usually, I go to Whole Foods and try to buy a single bar of a brand or flavor I haven't tried before purchasing an entire box... & I should have followed that rule before making this purchase.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I love the tart twang of cranberry and orange together - but the additional ingredients in this bar made it overly sweet for my taste.  I also found the texture to be quite gritty and overly moist.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars for the quality of the ingredients and because it would likely appeal to those who enjoy REALLY sweet fruit treats.<br /><br />I think in the future I will go back to Lara Bars."
"I don't know how these would taste if one is used to eating junk foods and cooked foods, but I have been eating only raw foods for two months and these bars are really a special treat.  The chocolate in them is as pleasing to me as any chocolate cake, brownie, or candy bar ever was when I used to eat junk foods - even more so because I know that they are healthy and I am truly satisfied once I am finished with the bar!"
"This bar is like having a piece of apple pie without the guilt!!! I would highly recommend this bar!  I have tried so many ""health bars"" and when I opened them up they all tasted dry and like cardboard....YUK!  Not this one!"
"If you like the taste of strawberry Pocky or strawberry Yan Yan, you will like these.  My fiance and I have an  American palette, but we were hooked on Hello Panda ever since he bought the ""Milk"" (Vanilla) flavor on a whim from the international aisle of a supermarket.<br /><br />They arrive in individual boxes packed in a display box (like at a store).  The individual packaging make them easy to throw in a bag or purse on the go (easy for pacifying fussy kids too!), and the individual outer cardboard package means these creme-filled cookies don't get crushed by your water bottle. :)"
These cookies are great. The biscuit part is not too sweet and the inside is a nice vanilla flavor. The designs are super cute as well~
These little chocolate cream filled cookies are pretty darn good.  I sent a few boxes with a friend of mine to take to work with her.  The people she works with devoured what she handed out and they were asking for more.  Looks like those folks will be placing orders with Amazon.com for more of these little chocolate cream filled devils.  Thanks Amazon.com.
"I bought these when I couldn't find the Choco-Koala cookies we usually buy. These are great little cookies and seem just like the Choco-Koala cookies. A light crunchy exterior with a wonderful chocolate center. They are small, so you can quickly chow down quite a few. Very, very yummy. Santa always remembers to bring some for the kids. Don't buy just a few boxes, get the whole case!"
"I bought these for a Halloween party with a lot of 2 & 3 year olds.  My kiddos treats were the hit, all the kids loved them and asked their parents for more.  Several parents said they snuck some of the cookies from their kids and loved them.  A fun snack for all!"
"these are by far the best cookies ive had in a long time, almost addicting for me xD"
Saw it at F.Y.E. At there unlike Amazon it was only $3.00. It was worth buying after I tryed it out. Taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it. Love it and yes would highly recommed.
These are made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; an adult can make the choice whether to eat them or not.  But why give them to kids with a perpetual sweet tooth who don't know any better?
"Ok, I absolutely love Better Cheddars cheese crackers, but this merchant is charging $12.99 for one 7 ounce box?  Really???!!!  I only pay $2.99 a box at the grocery store!"
"I was very unhappy with this purchase. The almonds were shriveled up & actually chewy. I have never had almonds this stale. I didn't even know that almonds could be this stale. There is no packing or expiration date on them...so, god only knows how long they have been hanging around.  I got 2 bags of them & they are both crap. I will be sending these back. Humph!"
"This is my 3rd buy of this item...and went to ""scheduled"" re-order as this is great buy and always fresh."
This seasoning is so tasty. Just pour about a tablespoon over Ramen noodles. It has the perfect blend of spice and sesame. Once you try it you will be hooked. Excellent!!
"It is surely verveine and probably organic as it claims, but the amount of twigs in is excessive. I guess you get what you pay for."
"This chocolate spread tastes very good, just the same as I remember from my childhood, full of nutty and chocolaty flavors, ....but without all the artificial additives or any GM garbage. I hope amazon will keep these in stock!"
"I am a huge chocolate addict. At times this presents a problem as I not only try to eat a low fat/low sodium diet but a more natural one with organic foods. There are many chocolate items I grew up with that I love but that are not necessarily natural or organic. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M"">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> is one of those products. Try as I might I just cannot stop buying it!<br /><br />When I found this spread at a local organic store I had to try it. I was eagerly anticipating that it would replace that ""other"" product for me. While it has the same type of creamy consistency it just lacked in the flavor department. It was not very chocolatey or nutty - in fact it was so mild that I didn't even notice any sort of nutty flavor much. In addition when you put this on toast that is hot/warm it melts VERY quickly which means unless you spread it very thin it is runny and drippy. I probably don't need to go much further since you get the picture (runny/drippy spread + trying to grab a quick breakfat + business attire = disaster). I do not have the same problem with the other spread I like -- it may get a little less firm but it does not run and drip everywhere. Of course if you only want a very *thin* spread this one would do nicely if you can compromise a bit on the taste which is blander than I prefer.<br /><br />In the end, for the cost and the issues, I just didn't think this was a winner. I would have done 2 stars BUT if you really want natural/organic and will spread this thin and watch the drippies it is better than some of the rest that is out there."
"This is one of the top makers in the world.  They also have premium herbs.  You see the white crocks in Williams-Sonoma and here at Amazon.  They make some of the best mustards in the world as well.  The problem is the import cost.  For the delivered price of this one SMALL ceramic cup, serving two people at most, I buy a half a case in Paris. The ceramic cups are nice and reusable.<br /><br />This is also their ""everyday"" mix.  Fine stuff without a doubt, but it is not their signature recette.  If cost matters to you, get a good double boiler, top grade melting chocolate and whatever flavorings.  I have to give all five stars for flavor, ease of use and for quality, but the price will drive most of us off. BUT...It is easy to reach for and will impress for a special occasion!"
"Great desert for a dinner if you don't know how to create a desert, does not want to spend too much money buying a prepared one, and wants to impress your guest. It is delicious. I used blueberries and the combination was sensational. Just be careful not to heat it too much. Follow the instructions!"
I was very pleased with the product i ordered and the seller. i received it in a timely manor the way it was advertised.
"Please be aware that while this is a hard to find ingredient, and this might seem an affordable source, the ingredients are different on the actual container than on the website. Mine contained rice flour, gum arabic, asafoetida, tumeric and wheat flour.<br /><br />This is a real deal breaker for anyone with a wheat problem/ celiac!!<br /><br />I gave a low rating for the misinformation, and also that asafoetida is the third ingredient which is disappointing."
"I heard about asafetida on ""The Splendid Table"" and had to try it.  It's a wonderful flavor.  Foodies or non-foodies should try this stuff!  Service from the vendor was top notch too."
"I say that perhaps this isn't a valid review because in all honesty, I didn't eat any of it.  I bought this product because I had read about some health benefits of Hing.  However, when it arrived, I found the smell of it so offensive that I couldn't bring myself to add it to any foods.  So I ended up tossing it away. I gave it 3 stars because I honestly don't know if it is excellent Hing or a not so good Hing. Sorry."
"After a trip to NY- I wanted to get another taste of the hot chocolate.  Well there is nothing to complain of here.  It is perfect and affordable- through amazon at least.  To order from his website, the shipping is very high."
"Its not the greatest hot chocolate, but for the price you pay its worth it. I prefer Godiva's hot-chocolate over this any day. However, I've no issues buying this again for the price."
"This is supposed to be the best chocolate, I disagree and found Swiss Miss to be more superior.<br />The seller first sent me the wrong order and put the blame on me, in which, was not the case, as proven by their follow up E receipt.  Then it took them more then a month to fill my order."
"Living in New York City, most people know Jacques Torres as a premium chocolatier. However my recent experience ordering Valentine's day chocolate has shown me otherwise. I ordered three boxes of chocolates for my sweetheart. The order cost nearly [...] which included [...] for 2nd day shipping. I recieved the chocolates promptly within two days of placing the order. When my girlfriend opened the box the contents were scrambled around inside the box. A couple of chocolates were broken (something you wouldn't expect for a truffle which has a soft center). This was my first alert that something was wrong. Biting into the chocolate the truffle was stiff, flavorless and had a moldy taste. This isn't the worst of it. I promptly called Mr. Chocolates (the Jacques Torres Website) and explained my dissatisfaction with the order I've recieved. Stephanie, at the phone number I called, said I need to send an email explaining my dissatifisfaction with the order. She said she would check with her superiors and let me know what they are going to do about it. I never got a response to my email so I sent a follow up email two days later. Her response at that time was that she still didn't know what they can do about replacing my order but that she would notify me when they decide what to do. Well now it's been a week and still no response. I'm extremely dissapointed with the lack of their customer response, the quality of the chocolates and their inability to promptly handle my complaint. Truly not worth ordering chocolates from Jacque Torres! Don't waste your time or money on these guys. BTW I wouldn't even give them one star except I wasn't able to post a review unless I gave them at least one."
"Great pine nuts.I ordered 15 lbs got them in a few days.Fast service, will recommend to all. Best price anywhere, will be back again."
"I eat mine mashed on buttered toast with fresh black pepper. These are medium fish, packed 5 in the tin. They were in good condition, a little firmer but still tender. The mustard is the vinegar-heavy yellow mustard, but unlike the Beach Cliff mustard fish completely dominated by vinegar, I could actually taste these Brunswick fish. The mustard/dill gives a pleasant tangy zip. I don't think mustard sardines are going to replace my standby sardines in tomato sauce, but these guys are good for a change."
"I have tried so many vodkas to name a few...Gray Goose, Belvedere, Absolute, Amsterdam, Six, Smirnoff, Ketel One, Skyy, among others... but I got this one "" Pravda"" right before my 45th Bday..... yes I am A woman I was thrilled by the beautiful bottle ..it reminded me of belvedere but with a stone....... If you are looking to impress your woman this is for sure the vodka.... lovely bottle.....but then the lovely part comes....... tasteless..... you think your not drinking alcohol... but after 2 tall ones ..it makes sense .......lovely bottle ... great taste.... will recommend 5 stars......"
"I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible. It almost made me hungry lol. The dog loves it and is doing well on it.<br />  I start doing more research on the food and was very impressed. The owners of this food make sure ethoxyquin, BHA and BHT (which are knowing to cause cancer) are NOT used at all in the food. They make sure that the slaughter and processing plants do not use them either. That is great and it show that they care as well.<br />  I have communicated with the Petcurean and have been very impressed with them as well. I am really happy with this food. It has very good ingredients. he company is great. I highly recommended this good and I have tired several different grain free dog foods.  Plus my dog loves it.<br />  Thank you amazon. i would have never found it without amazon."
"I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I am so happy with this food that I felt it was necessary! I was nearly at my wits end before I purchased this. When we adopted our Basset Hound, Lucy, a few months ago we started feeding her Innova from the get go. She had loose stools, but we figured it was just because it was a different food than what she ate at the rescue. We fed her pumpkin with the food, and she did great, but she also would not eat from then on without the pumpkin. We weened her off of the pumpkin, and as soon as we did she had loose stools/diarrhea again. Kept trying for a few weeks. It never let up, and she still had no real interest in eating the food at all. She would not eat for a day until she was starving. We nearly took her to the costly vet to see if she had some sort of digestive issue.<br /><br />We did some further research, and discovered that Innova was bought by P&G, and that there were many people that had been feeding for 10 years and suddenly started having loose stools so we decided it might just be the food. We immediately switched her to Petcurean Now!, and immediately her stool turned normal even though we did not phase it in. Lucy *loves* the taste of this food. We put it down, and she eats every last morsel without having to coax her. She is excited for meal time finally!<br /><br />I am so very content with this purchase. It is worth the slightly higher price tag if you want a happy, healthy dog."
Now Grain Free Turkey and Duck Formula dog food is great.  My shelties love it and I love that it has no junk in the formula.  It is healthy for my pets.  I receive my orders in a timely fashion and usually sooner than expected.  Amazon is great in getting the orders out.
"My dog is prone to allergies requiring treatment with steroids and antihistamines at least twice a year.  Since beginning this food his allergies have all but gone away.  I switched him directly to this food without gradually introducing it with no problems.  The food produces well formed compact stools which is a plus if he has an accident in the house.  Not that much more expensive than other ""high quality"" dog foods that contain grains and meal."
"this product was recommended by the breeder...our scottie loves it and looks forward to his meal...would definitely recommend this product to those with new puppies, even tho it is a little expensive, it does have all the nutrients required for good health..."
"I have decided that I want to provide the best quality food to my animals.  My dog loves this food, and hasn't had any digestive problems since moving to it.  Also does wonders for her coat.  Love this product."
"Our Bichon has a very sensitive stomach, so this is the only dog food we buy for her.  When we moved to another state, we had difficulty finding a retailer that carried this particular brand of dog food.  Ordering from Amazon.com makes it easy, and it is delivered to our door within a few days."
"The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food. I thought it would be smart to order through Amazon, since it is difficult to find in stores, but that was a mistake. It has been 14 days since I ordered, and the product has not yet arrive. Nine days after the order, it had not even shipped. And while it was shipped via Fedex, the Fedex tracking says the order will take about 6 to 7 days to deliver. The seller must have asked for special slow delivery... Never again will I buy from this seller."
"I purchased Now! Senior/Light last week in an effort to get one of my Bichon girl's very high triglycerides down.<br />IT's been a week feeding this food and her triglycerides are back to normal!  Also, a bonus is she likes it plain with nothing mixed in, and stool is firm and nearly no smell!<br /><br />Thanks for a great product!"
"I have searched really hard for dry kibble with out meal byproducts. Dogs eat bones, but not ground to a sandy material!"
"Like many pet owners, our 7-month-old Lhasa pup suddenly is getting picky, picky about her food.  The Now Dry Puppy Food is the eighth brand (wet and dry) I have tried and I am holding my breath because she actually ate a helping of it and why I gave it a 4 star rating.  It is also wonderful to be able to buy it in smaller quantities than 6, 10 or 15 pound bags only to find out she will not eat it and we donate bag after bag of dog food to our neighbors. I don't believe she is allergic to any of the brands but I think she is holding out for a human food menu.  I have high hopes for the Now Puppy Formula and will update this review when there is a change-positive or negative.<br /><br />Update:  Once again I thought our picky eater pup was going to turn her nose up at NOW on the third day but when I laid some kibble on the floor, she gobbled it up.  She likes wet food and pieces of meat in her bowl and dry food on the floor.  This is our third Lhasa and this adorable pup provides us with so many first experiences. The hunt for the perfect food for our picky eater is over.  I feed her Redbarn Premium Variety Pack Food Rolls cut up in treat-size pieces for all day treats and lay NOW dry food and extra supplement cubes (all combined to equal her daily allowance) on the floor in her exercise pen for her to eat at her leisure until just after her last meal of the day and what is left is taken away and all food and treats are suspended until breakfast the next morning."
"These are great.  Check out your local Dollar Tree if you haev one near you (or order them bulk on their website) because they are only $1 per bottle.  If you go into a store, just double check the expiration dates on teh bottom of the bottles."
"This matcha is amazing. There's a slight grassy vegetal flavor from the matcha, but it's really mostly amaretto without the alcohol burn and without all the sugar. Absolutely fabulous. If you like amaretto, you've got to try this!  All the deliciousness of amaretto without any of the negative effects from alcohol.  Think of all the ways you can use this!"
"This is so delicious! Truly a taste sensation. I could enjoy this any time of day but for me I believe this will be my evening ""night cap"" since it made with the white matcha I think I can get away with this! YUMMY! It truly feels like I am having a cocktail but I don't drink alcohol so this is a lovely substitute!<br /><br />I would love to be able to tell you some flavoring notes I pick up but its quite simple - its AMARETTO! lol I don't know how else to describe this. While I appreciate teas that give off a complex nature, many ways to describe the flavors within, this one is what it says it is no questions asked. A straight forward in your face AMARETTO and you can't ask for anything better than that!!"
My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Amazon's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Amazon prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!<br />Amazon shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were  not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Amazon- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that amazon offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered.
"My Boxers had HORRIBLE gas while on Science Diet & Royal Canin Boxer Formula. I switched to Wellness CORE & now there is no more gas. Their coats are nice & soft, they have lots of energy, they enjoy eating it, and I can breathe freely. :o)<br /><br />I highly recommend this dog food."
Since switching to Core my dog no longer has any sign of the skin or digestive problems that have plagued him for years!
I have used Wellness Core for a long time.  I did a lot of research before choosing it.  However after getting a new bag that was moldy I started doing some research.  The company has been bought out and many many consumers have complaints about the quality control of the food now and in some cases their dogs have been getting sick on it.  I am not saying not to buy it but just beware that it is not the same company anymore.
"Upon researching dog health I was appalled to discover that most dog foods (especially the most popular brands) use grains (as their main ingredients) and fillers. I then found a few lists of ""five-star"" dog foods, compared them, and chose to give Wellness CORE a try.<br /><br />Admittedly it is much more expensive than the popular commercial brand we had been using but,""according to the web site of one of the most popular brands of dog food sold in the U.S., the feeding instructions tell you that a thirty pound dog would need to eat around three cups of food per day. The cost of this pet food breaks down to being about $.67 per cup. So that means Fido would eat $2.01 worth of dog food each day according to the recommended feeding instructions on the label.<br /><br />But on the other hand, from a web site of a high end, all human grade ingredients, all U.S. ingredients dog food -- the feeding instructions tell you that a thirty pound dog would need to eat around 1 ½ cups of food per day. The cost of this food is about $1.16 per cup. This food seems to be about twice as expensive as the popular brand. However, according to the recommended feeding amount, Fido would eat $1.74 worth of dog food each day. That's a savings of $.27 per day to feed your dog a high quality, human grade ingredients, no risky imports dog food."" [[....]]<br /><br />It's true! My dogs eat half of what they used to and their bowel movements have also decreased by half. (I read that because the good foods contain the true nutritional needs of a dog as opposed to the bad foods that are relatively low in delivering their nutritional needs that dogs would ""go"" less frequently by feeding them a good food. This is because dogs would expel the unneeded grains and fillers in the bad food more often). I walk and feed my dogs in the morning and in the evening and both dogs would ""go"" 2-4 times between both walks and both meals. Now my 60 lb pit mix ""goes"" just once daily and my 20 lb terrier/lab mix ""goes"" just twice.<br /><br />I also read that bad foods contributed to a dogs allergies and bloating. My pit mix would have these huge disgusting ""eye boogers"" all day long no matter how often I'd wipe his face and my terrier mix had these dark (his coat is a sandy color) tear stains from his constantly watering eyes. Not anymore! The ""eye boogies"" have disappeared and the tear stains are gone! Although I never noticed any bloating in my little dog I did notice that my muscular pit mix had a ""fat"" stomach. Needless to say that is gone as well!<br /><br />Lastly, I noticed that both dogs have been shedding less and that their coats are so much softer and shinier. What pleasant surprises! Having a skeptical demeanor it's actually VERY surprising to me that there have been so many benefits to purchasing a quality food. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase! Thumbs up Wellness Core!"
"I have 2 allergy-prone French Bulldogs & it took many many years of experimentation with every type of dog food.  Finally a year ago... I came upon this product: WELLNESS CORE OCEANFISH & it was the absolute best food they ever had.  I am 100% pleased with this product & their health, as a result.  My bulldogs are fed this product 2x per day; I mix a little dry with the WELLNESS Oceanfish wet + a little water.  Their allergies have improved & they haven't been bored eating this everyday... They have now been on this food for over 1 year & I highly recommend it!  Great for bulldogs in particular!"
"We switched from wellness puppy to wellness core and our boxers just love the taste.  It not only has great taste, but the ingredients are pure and so healthy for dogs.  We noticed a signifiant decrease to their flatulance and their coats are so shiny!  Definately recommend to anyone who considers their dogs health above a bargain priced dog food at the supermarket.<br /><br />Update 3 August 2011<br />** Although the food is still fantastic, the last three orders I've purchased through Amazon have resulted in bags that were partially sliced open and leaking kibble all throughout the inside of the shipping box.  The first two times I thought it was just a coincidence, no big deal.  But this has become a recurring problem and it poses health concerns for my dogs now.  Since I love amazon, I'm willing to try it one more time however if it happens again, I'll be searching for my food elsewhere."
"Healthier Dogs, less stool.  Dogs are not grain eaters, most commercial dog foods get our pets sick with corn and wheat in their diets which compromises their immune system.  Check the ingredients and compare for yourself. Wellness uses human grade ingredients, not fillers."
"I have a 2 year old wheaten terrier that's been on Wellness Core for about 6 months.  Very happy with the results, he's a very fit and and active dog.  Wheatens are supposedly not good with wheat oddly enough.  This is one of the highest rated foods by dogfoodanalysis.com and it's pretty easy to find locally now.  I haven't found this through a Prime vendor yet but I keep hoping.<br /><br />***Update -coming up on 4 years soon and this formula is hard to find at local stores. I like giving him the variety of the different flavors..."
My Yorkshire Terrier had some skin problems when I had him on dog food brands I bought at local stores. I did some online research about possible causes and found food quaity and ingredients could be the cause. Wellness Core was recommended by several people as a good alternative. I started Charlie on Wellness and within a month no more skin issues and he actually like the food. It's dry food so helps with his teeth as well.
"To those of you spending way too much on prescription food; give this a try. My dog is highly allergic to just about everything. Prior to feeding her Wellness Core; I tried every other brand out there no matter how expensive (Nutro, Blue Buffalo), you name it! Nothing has worked as well as this. Even the slightest change in her diet would cause yeast problems in her ears, reddness and irritation of the skin, chewing her feet, and itchy gums. I have been feeding it for almost a year and have seen total improvement. Not too sure about the mold problem the other person has mentioned. I buy this religiously and have not had any problems with the quality of the food. The only negative I have is that my dog seems a bit more gassy than usual but I'll deal with that as long as all those other syptoms have gone away."
"What can I say? This dog food is one of the best, among the relatively short list of dog foods on dogfoodanalysis.com receiving their maximum rating of 6 stars. The ingredients are top tier and carefully chosen with your dog's well-being in mind. And apparently it's also delicious, because my dog LOVES it! When I set her food bowl down, she drools on the floor if I wait even just a few seconds to tell her she can eat. She had never ever done this before, and she started doing it the day I started mixing it into her food and has done it since.<br /><br />Plus, it's great for her. I'm not even halfway through this bag and already her coat is improving! I transitioned slowly from her old food and she has had no negative reactions to it whatsoever. If your dog tolerates this food (all dogs are different of course), you can be confident they will thrive on it. Oh and lastly, Wellness is more readily available than most other holistic grain-free foods, which is very convenient--I buy mine at Petco."
"Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness. No recalls of any kind thus far. I am really paranoid about having a sick pet with a 3-4 figured vet bill, so that is something I look out for a lot.<br />2. Ingredients is a lot better than most foods.<br />3. Palatable. My dog kinda hates Wellness but would eat down Wellness Core products literally right away.<br />4. High Fiber. 7% if I am not wrong. What made me try this food was that my dog had constantly soft stools at one point in time. So I saw the high fiber percentage, and I decided to try this out. My dog had really solid poop after that! It helped a lot for me so hopefully will be the same for you.<br />5. Relatively reasonably priced. About $1.80/pound.<br />6. No ethoxyquin preservative used.<br /><br />Way(s) this product is ""sub-par"" compared to the ""very top"" products. (This is really no biggie at all, but I just decided to write this because for some it might be an issue)<br />1. Dried varieties of certain products as opposed to fresh ones, such as dried ground potato instead of fresh ones.<br />2. Canola oil used instead of salmon oil which is a cost cutting measure used by the company. Dogs can't digest canola oil so the omega levels provided by it are pretty much just for marketing purposes only.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't really be concerned with the ""cons"" of the product if you even consider it as a con to start with.<br />This is a really good product that is priced pretty reasonable for its quality.<br />I would feel safe about feeding my dog this based upon the manufacturer's reputation of not having any recalls in its history.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
Great allergy food!!  I was feeding my 200lb English Mastiff TimberWolf Organics (Ocean Blue) until they changed the formula by adding cheaper ingredients like Chicken fat to replace fish oils. I found this formula by Wellness and my dog loves it!  Good quality food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they made a bigger bag for people with larger dogs like mine that go through 6-8 cups a day. :)
"We've been using Wellness CORE Grain-free (original) dry dog food for several years and it really shows! We began a grain free diet with one of our dogs about 15 years ago due to seasonal allergies (the vet had actually recommended going grain free). There are other really great brands of grain free out there, however, we've just stayed with Wellness CORE because it works. We get so many compliments one how our dogs have super soft, shiny coats and their eyes are clear and bright. They love their CORE and we only feed them dry. It is so worth the extra cost to feed a high quality dog food ~ grain free or not. Their bellies are full with great food ~ no additives, by products, etc. Both dogs that we originally started on CORE have since passed...but lived to the ripe old age of 17 and 19. Hopefully, our two current dogs (7 years and 9 months) will do the same! Highly recommend this food."
"I tried everything with my female Border Collie before I found Wellness.  She came to my family from a rescue where she was fed Innova.  She wasn't doing well on the Innova, so we switched her to Solid Gold.  That didn't work out, as she was having an excess of bowel movements after six months of being on the food.  From Solid Gold, we switched to Orijen, which was fantastic but very expensive and didn't have the same result as Wellness Core.  This is the only food I use now- I swear by it.  After taking in thirty foster dogs, I have fed exclusively Wellness Core and have never had a complaint about the high quality of the food.<br /><br />It is true that not all dogs have the same nutritional requirements, so I am sure there are plenty of dogs who do well on Innova, Solid Gold, or Orijen and do not do well on Wellness Core.  However, this is one of the few companies I trust to deliver consistant quality and high standards of healthy dog food for my pets.<br /><br />Well done Wellness!!"
"Bought this food after reading others reviews for my schnauzer who suffers from pancreatitis -- it really did the trick for him, since being on this food he hasn't had one day of trouble.  A GREAT food."
"Wellness CORE Grain-free Dry Dog Food, Original Recipe is a wonderful product. I have a German Sheppard guide dog and she has allergies to rice, it was hard finding products that didn't contain any rice or grain products. I tried the Wellness Core and my dog loved it and had no stomach distress.<br />It cost approximately $9.00 less than what I paid at the store, and no shipping charge. However on my second purchase they wanted to charge a shipping fee of $10.00. Needless to say I went to the store to purchase it."
"Since I switched my dog to wellness, he has had no digestive, coat or allergy problems. You do not see dogs running into a field to eat an ear of corn, so why do we feed them dog food primarily made from it? They are not vegetarians. He is happy and energetic. I've tried several different grain free foods and he loves this one the best."
"My dog loves this food and so do I. Ever since I have been feeding her this, she has had the softest fur and overall better digestion. Ive tried her on a few different foods but this is the one that Ive stuck with."
"The food is awesome. Even though it is just for my 14 year old that has weight issues, all my dogs love it.<br /><br />The problem I had was the bag arrived with a huge tear in it that had been taped shut. The box was undamaged so it was clearly shipped this way. The tear was a good 8 inches long, down the front of the bottom half of the bag. I was wary about using it, but we were running out of our previous bag.<br /><br />Now I am 1/3 of the way through (the bottom 1/3 of the bag because we dump the bags into airtight containers) and I find this huge wad of molded kibble clumped together. Clearly it got wet while it was ripped open! Where are they storing these bags?! And clearly whoever taped it shut either ripped it and knew it got water in it, or was not the one that ripped it and taped it at a later time not knowing what could have possibly happened to the food in the time between. Both are unacceptable practices. Are they so stupid they don't realize they could kill dogs doing stupid stuff like that?<br /><br />So now I have 2/3 of a bag of kibble I cannot feed without risking making my dog sick, and I have nothing here to feed him. I'll have to buy something else local and switch him cold turkey which is going to upset his digestive system. Wasting my money isn't cool. Making my dog sick isn't cool.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said their bag arrived ripped on another brand, and now having gotten a ripped bag with moldy food in it, I am INCREDIBLY wary about ordering food from Amazon ever again. Which sucks because that puts me back to seeking affordable shipping or buying local which is very limited."
"I've been a horrible Dad to my two-year-old minpin.<br /><br />I inherited him from the breakup of a friend's household, and knew next to nothing about the breed.  Since he and I joined company, I've kept up the habit of feeding him moist chunky meals from pouches, just because he liked them so, and turned up his nose at everything from a ""premium"" can that I tried.<br /><br />My co-workers and my vet finally  convinced me that, next to scraps from the table, I was employing the worst possible strategy for keeping him fit and healthy.  So, based on the reviews, I ordered a small bag of this as a test.<br /><br />Frankly, I'd been dreading the switchover. A highly-experienced dog owner at work warned me that I was probably headed for a war of the wills, and that I should prepare to tough out a day or two...or maybe three...of Max practicing his best Oliver Twist looks, trying to get me to relent.<br /><br />I poured out the first helping of this yesterday morning, Max ambled over to sniff around and take one test bite...and then practically swan-dove into the bowl.<br /><br /> If it's this good for him and he's this happy with it, I have zero qualms with the price.<br /><br />I am a very happy new customer.  And let it be trumpeted throughout the realm:  Maximus the Mighty is pleased."
"I supplement this with some Blue Buffalo occasionally up to 50%, but this is my dogs main food for the most part and he is a thriving and happy wheaten. Did a fair amount of research and this seems to be a safe and reliably sourced food. I supplement more from a human desire to change things up for him rather than any real need. The bag also has a ziploc closer which is kind of handy."
Our boxer had horrible skin alleges and threw up all other foods starting about age 7.  Since changing she has no allergy medications and only has stomach issues when she eats food my kids drop!  I highly recommend this!
"My one year old Westie has almost never had solid stool.  It was always semi-watery (sorry if this is TMI) and he had THE WORST gas.  I must have gone through about 10 different foods, always gradually changing between brands: Chicken Soup, Solid Gold, Wellness (not Core), Nature's Recipe, By Nature, just to list a couple.  I thought they were all high-end foods, but he still seemed to have an upset stomach after each one.  He also didn't seem too eager to eat his meals.  I switched to Wellness Core about a month ago and my puppy has been thriving ever since.  He enjoys eating, always has solid stool, and I can't remember the last time he passed gas.  His coat is looking better than ever, and almost everyone who pets him shrieks, ""He's sooooo soft!"" - It's great to hear considering Westies are notorious for skin problems.  I'm still not sure if it was the chicken that was giving him problems, or the grain, so I'm going to try Wellness CORE original and see how that goes since it's less expensive.  Two cons: Price (kind of lofty for a grad student...) and smell.  Has a strong shrimpy/fishy odor - he seems to like it though.  I will try to update on the Wellness CORE original."
"I have a dog with skin allergies and after a year of trying everything finally figured out that he needs a high protein low carb diet. I was cooking his food for a while but the smell of the liver cooking was too much for me, so I started looking for a dry food that was low carb high protein. He eats it - he isn't in love with it, but who would be after having home cooked meals for months! I still give him home cooked meat and cooked green veggies for breakfast, and the dry food for dinner. His fur has grown back and although he still gets itchy sometimes, his condition has improved 95%."
"I've done my fair share of research on dog food.  I went from the Wellness Super5Mix, which was a good dog food but gave my dog some bad gas and still had fillers in it.  Then I thought I was crazy for spending so much money on dog food, so I went to Beneful, which eliminated the bad gas but I felt bad feeding such garbage to my dog on a daily basis.  So I found this one and I haven't looked back!  Granted my dog will eat anything, but his coat looks brighter, shinier, and his poop doesn't even really smell, which I find unusual (Can't complain with that though).<br /><br />Cheapest to buy on Amazon, especially with Free Shipping.<br /><br />A must have purchase for me!"
"Bruno is the youngest member of my family, he is an eight-year-old Standard Schnauzer.  From early on, he struggled with getting to like and benefit from the many different brands of dry foods that he tried. He was under Veterinary's care eating prescription food since he was ten weeks old. Yet, he still had a difficult time eating his food. After paying so much on prescription food, I came across Core Grain-free dry food, it was amazing, prior experience taught me when I would switched his food he would get diarrhea. However, when I change his food to Core Grain-free, he actually finish his food, No DIARRHEA, and he always looks forward his meals.  Prices are competitive in most places, however, amazon is least expensive place that I have come across and most times I get free shipping."
"I was feeding both of my dogs 1st- Costco Brand food.  Next moved to IAMS.  My dogs had so much gas it was CRAZY!  Wellness CORE stopped the gas completely.  Their energy levels have risen too. One of my dogs was always scratching, she had stinky breath, was really gassy- she has a more sensitive system then the other dog. This dog food fixed everything.  I can hardly believe it. I will always buy my sweet dogs Wellness CORE from now on!"
Our dog had to go on a grain free diet due to stomach issues and no longer has any bowel or stomach issues to speak of.  This is the real deal as far as healthy pet food goes.
"I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and he has been on Wellness Core for about 4 weeks.  His coat has never looked or felt better.  He had a bit of an itchy dry skin problem so I tried adding fish oil to his previous dog food but he hated it.  So, I needed to find a better dog food.  As soon as the bag arrived he was after it.  He loves the food.  He is healthy and happy and I just can't say enough about how this dog food does wonders for the skin and coat!  He has long fur and on the Wellness One it stays smoother and softer longer and is easier to maintain with a brush.  His coat is also thicker and stronger.  He looks amazing and it's due to Wellness Core.  I recommend it to anyone who loves their pet but especially if you have a long-haired breed.  He has fewer stools and is less gassy as well.  I'm sure this food is a lot easier for him to digest and I know it tastes better because he can't get enough of it.  Try it, you'll love it."
"Switched to this after two years of Science Diet. I couldn't believe that SD has by-products, so I switched and my dog loves this. I also use the regular wellness wet-food, which he devours, too."
"We have tried a number of different Wellness dry dog mixes, and our Wheaten Terrier loves them all, but this one is his favorite. I love the fact that it isn't 90% grain, which most cheap and expensive dog foods seem to feel is great filler. Our little guy doesn't digest grains well, so this mix is especially wonderful for him since it is grain free. We plan to try the Ocean Core some day also.<br />Thanks Wellness for making a truly 5 star dry dog food, healthful and tasty!"
"This product works perfectly for my pups-one with a grain allergy.  It is very easy for us to purchase, as we would have to travel 45 miles to get grain-free food where we live.  It is also cheaper than if it were purchased at the store.  PLUS-free shipping!"
"After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein."
"In short, our experience has been that this is awesome food for adult years.<br />Two dogs:<br />Male GSD on Core from five years old to 10-1/2 years old.<br />Female Rottie, On a mix of 1ea 26lbs bag Core and 1ea 35lbs bag Canidae All Life Stages formula  at five years old, still on it at seven years old.<br /><br />All dogs are different, so your results may vary.<br /><br />Took a bit more than 9 days for a smooth transition for the GSD, with a bit of loose stool during the transition (off Purina One).<br />The Rottie, had no problems, and made the switch in an easy 7 days.<br />For the GSD senior years, it is too much protein.<br />GSD eats about 2.5 cups a day.<br />Rottie eats over 4 cups a day.<br /><br />Fed Super-Mutt (the GSD) on this for about 7 years, until he was 10-1/2.  He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.  So as a test I switched him to a senior food (Chicken Soup for the Soul), this is much lower protein.  This change brought his kidney functions back to normal, and digestibility is better.  So he is enjoying his senior years on ""senior food"".<br />Hth,"
"I started using Wellness Core Ocean about 3 months ago. I have English Bulldogs, and work very hard to make sure they eat the best food available. Even though a number of my co-workers at a veterinary hospital were skeptical, I was told to report back and let my colleagues know of my results. I am very impressed with this food. My dogs who are confined in the house for most of our brutal Arizona summers are heavy all summer long... not this year. Their coats are spectacular, no swollen tail folds and face wrinkles... shedding is down to a minimum. I have not bought the food from Amazon, but I will try it next month... at this price, why not?<br />  As for the recall, it has nothing to do with diamond foods, Core is separate. The only food effected by the recall will never be made with that partnership again. It's best not to get hysterical about something that simply is not going to effect you. Some people love to frighten others.<br />  In my almost 30 years of looking at skin and coats, I've never seen results like this. I can buy a large selection of foods at a deep discount, a perk at our veterinary hospital, but will not choose that road.<br />I will report back on my shipment quality when I get it.<br />Andrea"
"This was one of the best dog foods on the market, hands down. First four ingredients were meat, only two were ""meal"" and absolutely no grain. I've been feeding it to my dog for probably a year and he has the most beautiful coat, healthy disposition, and good weight. Plus as a finnicky eater, he downed it no problem!<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br />The most recent bag I bought seemed... off. My dog didn't want to eat it (he did eventually) and he started to have loose stools. It smelled different. I realized, after some sleuthing and, more obviously, checking the back of the bag, that Wellness changed the ingredients! No notice, just changed them. They got rid of some of the meat, there is more fat, and slightly different percentages of nutrients. I'll grant that my dog's stomach probably got upset because of a rapid food change (unbeknownst to me, obviously), but I'm still very disappointed that they changed the formula."
First class food for my pups.  Fair price and about as convienient as is comes.  Definitely the way to purchase your pet food.
"Went from Eukanuba to Royal Canin. Good move.<br /><br />Royal Canin to the best, Wellness Core. Best move ever for my mini dachshund who's a vicious lil monster.<br /><br />My dog also attacked the Amazon box, just like that big brack dog pictured above."
We used to feed my dog Science Diet Nature's Best but it is being discontinued and we had to find something new. After much research we decided to go with Wellness CORE. I have a 2.5 year old Golden Retriever and immediately we noticed a huge change in her appetite. We always assumed she was a finicky eater before because she seemed disinterested in her food and wouldn't eat her full meal. As soon as we switched her food to CORE she started eating her entire meal and shows way more eagerness while waiting to be served. I'm glad we made the switch to CORE and my only regret is that we didn't do it sooner.
"My husband and I have a 3 year old chihuahua/ Mexican Hairless mix. Like many hairless dogs, he's prone to skin problems like dryness, irritation, and pimples. Our vet recommended that we try switching him from Eagle Pack to a grain-free dog food and adding a fish oil supplement. We swiched to Wellness Core (Poultry) a few months ago, and his skin has definitely improved. Best of all, he loves it!"
"We started our rescue dog on this food a few months after getting him. He was on a lower-quality food prior to that, and we also tried one other high-quality, grain-free food. The other high quality food seemed to have too many ingredients for him, his stools were not consistent. However, as soon as we got him on Wellness he did extremely well, his stools have been perfect since then, his constant tearing and tear stains have disappeared, and we get lots of compliments on his gorgeous coat. He never leaves any food on his plate, and he is a very healthy, happy dog on Wellness Core!"
"This is great food for dogs! My dogs usually weren't too enthusiastic about dry food, but they eat this stuff without any problems. I love that it is very healthy for them and grain-free with no undesirable ingredients. I supplement their food with salmon oil, so I'm happy to feed them this product, which has a reduced amount of fat. I also mix this dry food with other premium dry food or premium can food sometimes. I really enjoy providing my dogs with a variety of highly-palatable food that is good for them. One of my dogs had skin/allergy problems, and the healthy diet with reduced grains and increased omega oils has completely healed her skin and made her coat softer. This Wellness CORE Grain-free Dry Dog Food, Reduced Fat Recipe, is the one premium dry dog food that I mix with everything my dogs eat (with added salmon oil most of the time, although I did test them to see if they would eat it without the salmon oil, and they did). I highly recommend this wonderful product. A+++++"
"This is a great dog food and our dogs do very well on it.  Particularly, no gassiness as with some other brands.  Another reviewer mistakenly said that this food was made by Diamond Pet Foods, who have been experiencing product recalls.  I took the time to email Wellness and asked them if this Core Dry dog food is produced at Diamond Pet Foods.  Here is their official response: ""CORE was never made at Diamond. We have spent the last 2 years expanding production at our Mishawaka, Indiana facility to bring the majority of our production into our own WellPet facilities.  Our facility includes a state-of-the-art onsite quality and safety laboratory and advanced extrusion systems all designed to produce the most nutritious, high-quality natural pet food possible, with a focus on food safety and compliance with regulations.  Our goal is to have all of our dry food made in Mishawaka buy the end of 2012. If the CORE is not made at Mishawaka it is made at American Nutrition or Vitaline.""<br /><br />So do not be duped by ignorant reviewers who are quick to spread misinformation and do not take the time to back up what they are saying.  I hope everyone who has second thoughts now has them dispelled."
"My dog really seems to like this food, and it treats her well.  She has never had an upset stomach or anything from this.  When I switched to this food vs a cheaper food, she shed a lot less and her coat is much smoother.  But, I get the product about $8 cheaper ordering through petcarerx.  I love Amazon and shop here frequently, but they are not competitively priced for this product."
"When we got our dog (rescue mutt) I did a lot of research about dog food, which helped me tremendously with how to analyze the ingredient list to find the right food.  But doing that research still leaves you with a pretty decent-sized list of high-quality foods.  I've tried several and our dog definitely has her own opinions.  She was fine with some for awhile, but then got tired of them, Blue Buffalo being one example.  Others she just turned her nose up at right from the start--surprisingly including Taste of the Wild, which most dogs seem to be crazy about.  But the Wellness CORE original recipe has been something she's liked consistently for a long time now.<br /><br />She's never had any allergy issues with this product, her eyes and coat look great, she has tons of energy and, thank heavens, no gas.  In the fall and winter she eats windfall apples and the stench is beyond belief, so I'm grateful that the rest of the year the Wellness CORE keeps her gas-free!<br /><br />If you're looking for a high-quality, grain-free dry food for your dog, give Wellness CORE a try."
"I have one picky eater pooch. On top of that, she has a sensitive stomach. That being said, this kibble is perfect. No harsh ingredients to upset her tummy, yet it tastes good enough that she wolfs it down. I love the fact that it is grain free, and I love that I can get it shipped on a regular basis!"
"I am confused by the reviews for the different types of food from Wellness Core because they are all the same. When reviewing the Ocean Blend, it is the exact same review for the Reduced Fat and Original. I have had my 6 year old golden retriever on the Ocean Blend for 6 months and she has gained 10 pounds! Nothing else has changed in her life and I was even feeding her a reduced amount because I feel the recommended feeding is always too much (duh! buy more!). In researching the Reduced Fat option, I found no difference in the reviews. Seems odd. I will be going back to a Raw diet as she never had a weight problem while she was on it. I switched her because I honestly hate dealing with the Raw food.....but it obviously was a better choice."
The dogs love CORE.  My son's dog was given a choice of CORE and another dog food.  He ate the CORE and left the other dog food in the bowl.
"Sashie loves this dog food. For some reason, she tires of her other dog food I have tried. So far, she's still eating this one & seems to look forward 2 dinner time."
I feed my small dogs twice a day alternating between the low fat dry and regular dry food adding a little bit of canned for additional flavor.  I guess the clue that is is good is the excitement my dogs dipslay when I head their way at feeding time.  I prefer the grain free food.
"I have been feeding this to my dogs for about six months. One year ago my female greyhound was dealing with a rash on her stomach and infections on her feet. I thought I was feeding her a quality dog food. But I was taking her to the vet almost every month. She took antibiotics for almost four months to get rid of the infections. This made her lose her appetite. Then I started her on Wellness Core. She loves it and so does my other greyhound and shephard mix. After six months my female greyhound has no infections of any kind and my male greyhound has a black, shiney coat. My shephard mix is happy and calm. All the dogs love this food. None have skipped a meal since I started using it. I am happy because I am going to the vet only for yearly shots. This dog food is great."
my dog loves this dog food :) I think feeding my dog a good quality dog food is very important!
"My husband researched dog foods as we looked for one to transition our puppy => dog.  Our vet encouraged us to go off the puppy food and because our rough-and-tumble aussie has a sensitive digestive tract we only wanted to do this once.  He likes the food and amnz has a great price.  We used a website that analyzes dog food on nutritional properties and we wanted to be sure the local ""big box"" pet supplier carried it in case we didn't get our order in time.  It does smell fishy and that can be a bit rough for the morning scoping but that is really the only down side so far."
"I spent HOURS researching dog food.  I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.<br />Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that ""dog smell"".  It has to be the food. :)"
"Have been feeding our dogs this food for a couple of years now. Recommended by Vet. Dogs maintain healthy weight, and seem to have less alergies."
"After trying several quality dog food brands we discovered Wellness Grain-Free CORE Original.  Both Golden Retriever and Welsh Springer Spaniel love and thrive on this food with no weight gains, itching or allergies.  They like it both wet or dry and never seem to tire of it.  Expensive but worth having healthy happy dogs."
"I recently switched to this food for my three dogs, an eight year old chocolate Lab, a ten year old miniature Dachshund and a one year old miniature Chihuahua. They all like it. The lab has actually left food in her bowl, but just because she is satisfied with less. She goes to her feeding eagerly but doesn't finish it all. The doxie has always been greedy, but now leaves the leftovers alone if I keep an eye on her. The littlest has been a free feeder from the start and may actually be eating a little more than before. The most important difference I see is their energy levels, the older ones are acting like puppies again. Their coats are shiny and thick, even the Chihuahua has thick fur now! I had hoped they would do well on a grain free diet, and this is even better than I expected. I have put this food on a subscribe and save basis so I will never run out!"
"Nowadays I have my dog on the Raw/Prey diet. However, I still keep wellness in stock and handy on days where I cannot prepare her meal. The reason is simple, Wellness is top of the line dry dog food.<br /><br />Taking a quick glance at their ingredients and you will see the major difference between Wellness and your average, everyday, popular and cheap dog food.<br /><br />However, don't just take my word for it. I encourage everyone do their own research and read about all the great benefits and possible cons associated with Wellness."
"Well, after several different tries at different foods, I finally did some research this morning and decided to try Wellness Core. I bought the Ocean one since my dog (a 10 year old smooth coat collie) loves fish.  I really think that is why she has always loved to get into the cat's kibble... she likes fish!<br /><br />She has allergies to corn and wheat I think. Her skin was always a problem for years. I finally started giving her fish oil and later olive oil on her food.<br /><br />She has never liked any dry kibble I've given her, and I admit I've given her some poor quality foods not knowing it (Beneful, Pedigree, Nutrish...etc.)<br /><br />Well, I went and bought the Wellness Core this morning, walked in at lunch and she FOLLOWED me, sniffing the bag (can she really smell it through that bag?)<br /><br />I dumped out the Rachael Ray Nutrish that had been sitting in her bowl since YESTERDAY, and put 1 cup of this Wellness Core Ocean in her bowl.  She went right up to it, took one piece out, put it on the floor and ate it... took another piece out, put it on the floor and ate it.. and then proceeded to put her head in the bowl and eat it all up!  She then drank some water, went and lay down, and did NOT BOTHER ME while I was eating a turkey sandwich!  Wow.<br /><br />I am so hopeful that this food is the answer for her."
"We've had an adopted Boxer for nearly 2 years and despite starting with great Wellness brand products that were corn free our boxer had horrendous GI issues. No amount of pumpkin, yogurt, oil, or fiber was changing things, and the vet was happy we came in for not infrequent Ova/parasite checks which were all negative.<br /><br />After trying all of the Wellness brand combos we tried Core Fish and our dog loves the taste, and for once isn't the poop-ing-est dog at the dog park. It's not cheap and absolutely I'm sure there are other options for most dogs, but if you have a Boxer or sensitive stomached dog and are used to being the person with 5 poop bags all the time give it a try if you have the budget."
"Our Heeler is 12 years old, and up to now we've always fed Nutro to her with excellent results.  Lately however, with the onset of old age, she has gotten weak and listless and had to be coaxed into eating. One day I decided to try a new brand of food to see if it would at least help her appetite.  I did my research and Wellness Grain-Free CORE food always came out with 10 stars.  I bought a bag and immediately our dog began to eat again. I can't say enough good about the results of this food with our dog. She has energy again, and even though her endurance is what you'd expect from an old dog, she is happy and eager to go on short walks.  The ingredients are top of the line, and it even has a pleasant odor. It was a lifesaver for our old pooch."
"Our lab has developed an allergy to chicken over tha past 6 months. We have had a very hard time finding a food that does NOT contain ANY chicken or poultry by products! This one does not. It;s great, only warning is the fishy smell of it, but you get used to it after a while!"
"This is a great product. Although my dog would prefer some tasty wet food, my mind is at ease when he eats this healthy, grain free dog food. The best part about getting this dog food was that I didn't even have to get off the couch to order it and it was on my doorstep in 2 days with AMAZON PRIME!!!!"
"The Wellness grain-free dry dog food recently ordered from Amazon.com is very nutritious.  My mini schnauzer never wanted to eat dry dog food until I started give her Wellness, which I had originally purchased for the newest member of our family, a Border Collie, who also loves it!  The product was well packaged and came in only two days.  I highly recommend it!"
"Although my picky dog does not like this, all the other dogs that visit my home do.  I dog sit so I like to have extra food for them just in case.  My dog Snickers doesn't seem to like any dry food until another dog came to stay with us for awhile and he had Kibbles and Bits and Snickers loved it but the other dog ate all of the Core and wouldn't touch his Kibbles and Bits.  So I gave the half used bag of Core to his owner.  Core is made of very good stuff and just because my picky little Snickers doesn't like it, I would not hesitate to recommend it."
Good quality and our dogs will eat it.  Many dry dog foods they just turn their noses up to.
"Excellent, high-quality dog food for my sweet rescue lab mix who has epileptic seizures & must have extremely good-quality food.  I highly recommend this food & this price is the lowest for a 26 pound bag.  Cheaper than all of the local stores, with no shipping charge!!!"
"This is a great choice if your schedule/budget/dog's appetite doesn't allow for raw food or a freeze-dried solution. If you're on this page, chances are you've read about feeding your dog a natural, grain-free diet to combat issues with your dog's health, most commonly skin-related. Many dogs have a grain ""allergy,"" causing itchiness and rash, which is often wiped out by switching to a grain-free diet.<br /><br />My dog doesn't do the raw thing, being an old man and set in his ways, and so he prefers kibble. I've personally never fed him anything but grain-free food, and hardly ever notice him scratching or biting at his skin. He absolutely loves this food, and being old and lazy having a low-fat alternative is great for his activity level. There are many grain-free choices out there, so I would personally highly recommend trying different kinds to see what your dog likes - I have to admit that I haven't seen many low-fat grain-free kibble products, so this is the one I went with. Couldn't be happier, especially with Prime shipping!"
"I am frim believer in feeding my pets premium dog food. I have been through a few different kind, and Wellness Core is fantasic. I have a high energy Cardigan Welsh Corgi,and she loves the food. I love that it is not grained based, she has a very shiny, healthy coat. eats less, and has less stool. It is well worth the money. Amazon by far has the best prices on all dog and cat food, and most of it will qualify for free shipping."
"I have been feeding my pup this food for the last 6 months (after she turned 1), and the glossiness and softness of her coat is amazing. On our walks and at the dog park, people regularly comment on how pretty and shiny her coat is. She is an energetic, playful pup who is constantly coming back from the dog park with a healthy layer of slobber, and after about 30 minutes, her coat is glossy again, no need to brush it or anything.<br /><br />An added bonus is she LOVES the food. I've even used some kibbles as treats and she does all her tricks for just a bite of it. Great stuff, she'll be a wellness pup for life!"
I couldn't be happier with Wellness Core! My dogs love it and I'm happy that they are getting all the nutrients they need without all the added grains. I also had a tad of the Wellness food topper/mixer which they drool over! The topper/mixer is also grain free. Gotta love it!
"My miniature schnauzer not only was putting on a little weight with the lamb/rice, it was making his stomach upset for a while.<br /><br />On the vet's recommendation, I switched to this food and it has been great for him for over a year now.  He also gets way more excited about this food than the previous one.  Highly recommend it."
My dogs love this food and they have both lost weight with out have to decrease the amount that they are fed
"My Dog has G.I. issues and I thought this food would be better for him with a suggestion from another pet owner...<br />However, My dog still prefers ""ROYAL CANIN"" for boxers...<br />I think for a boxer, it is harder for them to get a hold of the little chunks of food as opposed to the ""custom"" shaped nuggets Royal Canin provides in their product...<br />I will stick with Royal Canin...<br />Its not about what is better for them, its what THEY like in the end..."
"I switched to Wellness about 2 months ago.  I buy the low cal one for my ""bigger"" girls and the regular Core food for my other dogs.  Best change I ever made.  It's not cheap -- I have 7 dogs, but their health is more important.  I mix either Wellness Core canned or Paul Newman's Organic canned food in in the am and the dry kibble in the pm.  All the dogs love it.  No gastric problems -- I've a bulldog and they have sensitive tummys and she loves this and has much less gas.  Before this i tried Royal Canin, which they also liked, but I decided to go totally grain free.  Again, pricy, but worth it if you can save on vet bills and have healthym happy animals.  Every one of my dogs love it -- and a few of them are fussy eaters.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a healthy alternative for their pets.  I change up the flavors every now and then to keep them from getting bored.  I know I wouldn't want to eat the same thing every night - hence the addition of the canned mix.<br />My Golden, who's over weight, has lost 5 pounds eating the lo cal version -- I couldn't be happier with this product."
"I purchased this food for my finicky chihuahua. I noticed that I was throwing away more of her Royal Canin Chihuahua food than she was eating, so I knew I needed to make a switch, and I wanted to try high-quality, grain-free foods.  At the recommendation of several friends, I decided to try Wellness Core and am so glad I did! The first day I mixed it with her previous food (Royal Canin Chihuahua) and she actually spit out the old food and only ate the Wellness Core!  She didn't have any stomach issues with it.  The next day she again gobbled down the Wellness Core.  My only complaint is that the pieces are a little big for her (a little smaller than a dime). She can still manage, but I wish there was a small dog version.  When I decided to make the switch to Wellness Core, I calculated how much it would cost in comparison to the Royal Canin Chihuahua I had been buying.  I was actually paying $14 for 2.5 lbs of Royal Canin at Petsmart, but got 12 lbs of Wellness Core, a higher-quality food for $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon- quite a savings!  I would recommend that anyone looking to go grain-free, or even just wanting a higher quality food try Wellness Core!"
"I have 2 dogs, ages 5 and 10, and we have tried numerous foods. My dogs had been on Blue Buffalo and my vet recently told me to switch because he had read some negative things about it. He wanted me to switch to Science Diet, Eukanuba or Iams and I knew I did not want to put my dogs on any of them. I started with Wellness Super Mix and then switched over the the Grain Free as I noticed my bassett hounds eyes were tearing up a lot and had a friend put her dogs on grain free food for the same reason. They tolerated both foods very well, however; I am going to try the Wellness for allergies as I still notice her eyes to be tearing up. Both of my dogs have a loooong history of bladder infections and have both been to the vet twice in the last 6 months to have their urine checked and have remained infection free. I feel that it's because of the switch to Wellness."
"This dog food is fabulous. My dachshund became a little overweight on a different dog food, we switched to this food and she lost it right away. I have kept her on it because she loves it, and she has maintained a perfect weight. I don't see why I would ever switch!"
"My vet has long recommended I switch to a brand like Wellness, and despite the fact that it's a bit pricey, I decided my dogs' health is worth it. The ingredients are much better than Purina One, which they'd been eating for years, and I feel good that I'm giving them one of the best foods out there. It's a plus that I can get it shipped in two days using Amazon Prime."
"Our french bulldog has food allergies to the vegetarian dry dog food her brother and sister eat, but she does very well on this food. We're not sure what she's allergic to, but this grain-free meat-based food is excellent for her. She loves it (of course, she eats ANYTHING!), has shiny soft fur, nice stools, and is happy and full of energy. Strongly recommended for dogs with food allergies."
"I love this product.  My dog does extremely well on it, and his itching has lessened since starting it.  He eats it without any need for additives - wet food, etc.  Even my cat tries to shove him out of the way for his food.<br /><br />The only con is cost.  It's several $$ more expensive on this website than it is in store.  Once the price falls a bit, I'll be more than happy to purchase it online."
I started my Golden Retriever on this food...slowly switching him to it from another brand.  He had the worst gas I have ever smelled in my entire life.  You couldn't even be in the same room with him.  Need less to say he is not eating it anymore.
"I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this ""premium"" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called ""Life's Abundance"". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman."
"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying"
"Mistake #1 was that I paired this with 2 pounds of dextrose.  Mistake #2 was that I only fermented about 3 weeks.  The net result has been a cidery/funky mess that I can't bring myself to dump down the drain.  Next time I'll use Coopers Brew Enhancer 2, or better yet 3 pounds of light dry malt extract."
"Aunt Jemima Original Syrup is a beautiful golden-brown, delicious, artificially-flavored vestige article of Jim Crow South.  It continues to elevate the unrivaled privilege of its white owners' progeny, while conversely, it's success in the 19th century was achieved with successes in marketing which centered on the exploitation of the image of a playfully ignorant African American woman otherwise aptly described as the quintessential ""mammy"" archetype. Revel in nostalgia for the good ol' days as you lather your pancakes in Jemima's sweet forbidden nectar and taste the spirit of the 1800s!"
Some of my family members love this syrup.  It is a good value and they love it for breakfast with pancakes.
"Nothing wrong with the syrup. Just a heads up that these are 12 ounce bottle, not the usually bigger bottles (24 oz I believe). So each bottle's content is equivalent to a can of soda. So even though this is a 6 pack, it ends up being pretty expensive. I got it because I'm an Amazon Prime member (free shipping) and am too lazy to go to the supermarket."
"This is a tasty, nutritious snack (My husband eats them spread w/peanut butter).  Unfortunately, I can't find them at a store near me, so I was happy when I found them online.  The shipping was prompt, but not packed or handled carefully enough.  The packages have many broken ricecakes."
I love Rice Cakes and tried Lundberg for the first time.  Terrible!!<br />There is no mosture in the cakes.  The cinnamon taste terrible.  I actually opened another pack to see if the first one was rotten but found the second to be the same way.  Donated the rest to our homeless shelter.
"A great addition for rice dishes, soup,stews meat and fish dishes. This addition brings out the true latin flavor.The fresh recaito (a leaf like herb)is better, but the recaito in jars or bottles serves just as well.I keep this delightful herb in my refrigerator."
"I have alwys wanted to taste my mothers good old cooking--Amazon made-it happen! Being here in the US in special central makes it a bit harder for us to find products that complement our customs and traditions. Amazon as usual makes it available and at reasonable price. For those who are curious, this product is what gives foods at Hispanic restaurants and home cooking styles a five star.  I highly recommend this product for any dish with beef, chicken, fish, beans, etc. I use it most on my slow cooker."
"I thought this was the miracle sauce/marinade.  Unless it's a typo, the second ingredient is Coriander and NOT Cilantro.  It also contains mono-sodium glutamate.  That said, I will buy again."
"These are great.  Lots of (undoubtedly artificial) cherry flavor, and not doughy like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8J2HO"">Twizzlers Cherry Nibs</a>. Just perfect!"
I like these but if you eat too many (a whole pack) you may well feel a little worse for ware! It's hard to stop though...they are yummy!
The last batch of Twizzlers that arrived on a quarterly auto order were the freshest I've received.  I give away over half the order because they are too addictive to keep around.
"I bought Twizzlers Cherry Pull-n-Peel on an impulse while shopping in a discount store. Stupid me, I didn't realize that all Twizzlers are not created equally.<br /><br />The first bite was OK. Then, I got this overwhelming feeling that I was consuming chewy cough medicine. I know it's candy -- but this was soooo outrageously artificial and medicinal tasting that I wanted to gag.<br /><br />Blech. Live and learn. Next time, I'll stick with the strawberry."
Pop likes these pears very much. This is a good size of can to last him a few days and they are always fresh quality pears. Glad he can eat something good and the price is also reasonable.
Autumnberry was a gift and has turned out to be a staple in our kitchen. Wonderful flavors for any vegetable dish and flavors seafood with a nice touch. Must try it to believe it.....Great gift!
"Recently I wound up giving up sugar for life after seeing what my Mom goes through having diabetes. My family has a long history of diabetes so I quit sugar, but craving for chocolates don't go away at this young age ( i am 21 ) so i decided so start having No sugar added chocolates Ive tried almost every sugar free brands from Russell stover to Hersheys but they never felt real. Until I had these, Guylian Milk Chocolate bars :) I am in love with these and order these 6 packs once or twice a month. They also come in dark for those dark chocolate lovers :)"
"I used to eat boxes and boxes of Hershey's chocolate as a child, so I think I know my milk chocolate ;)<br />I bought my first bar at an airport, strangely enough, and from that moment I was in love and bought a box online the minute I got home.<br />I've cut out milk chocolate from my diet because it isn't that healthy and contains way too much sugar.  While this still isn't the healthiest food out there, you can satisfy your milk chocolate craving without the guilt you'd get from eating a Hershey's bar.<br />Besides eating it straight, it works perfectly as dessert toppings and drizzles.  It's incredibly creamy and sweet, you'd never guess it's sugar free.<br />It works great in fudge: [...]<br />It also works great in chocolate molds: [...]"
"We like the Santa Cruz spritzers and this is our favorite flavor. Sure, there's not much juice in them but we think it is a nice alternative to soda when you want something more than water."
Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again
Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also
very wonder very light melow taste tea. not over powerful. great sit down read take knote type of tea. i tryed out see how good was.<br />well worth money spend.
"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
"I was surprised to see that this product actually works, but they don't warn you about the god-awful smell. It's horrid, truly."
"Mild taste. Just add some honey and it's just like any other mild tea you would buy. Supposed to be great for allergies and Stomach bloat after drinking/eating poorly, noticed it does calm my stomach down and aid in flattening the post drinking bloat. Worth it! Try to drink a cup before bed each night! Caffeine free!"
"Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy. I love it! his will definitely be a repeat order."
I am loving this tea. Its very tasty with just a teaspoon of agave nectar.  I was recommended this by a doula to help with upcoming labor! I will let you all know if it helps :) Regardless its yummy.
"This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online."
"I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals."
"This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill."
"I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas; this is a great addition to my current mix.  The tea bags make it easy to enjoy at work."
Tastes Great!  My wife and I drink this tea on occasion and regular grocery stores dont usually have it in stock.
"For me the tea has light taste, I drink it once a day for about 2 months, hoping to have better hair and nails (after seeing it on Dr.Oz). So far, I haven't seen the result, yet, but I'm hopeful."
"When I bought this I didn't think it would be so tasty. This tea has a very flavorful, sweet, natural taste. I am a big tea drinker and always hunt for a new taste and this is definitely at the top of my list."
I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected. Also it smells and taste better than I expected!
"I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry."
"I bought this for my wife who is pregnant, and she drinks it everyday and likes it. I guess it helps to reduce delivery pains, but I'm no expert on the subject."
i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.
Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.  Going to order more.  Nice and smooth.
I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling. The only thing I don't like is that on the shelf it smells like vomit. It grosses me out. It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.
"I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too. I bought a pound of loose nettles from somewhere else for a lot cheaper, and the taste is so much better."
These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.
I dont do this as much as i should becuase it makes you poop all day!!!! but its awesome for detox and sometimes it makes you nausous but other than that its good. tasts good
the tea is very good with honey and I have seen a difference. I have lost 3lbs since taking it.
I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.
"I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!"
"This is a good tasting tea at a great price. If you don't normally like raspberry flavor, this isn't really raspberry flavor, if that makes sense. No heavy flavor."
I do like herbal teas in general and this fennel seed tea has a very pleasant aroma and taste to it.
"I have used this product for quite some time on and off.  It is easy to use, drink a cup before bed and<br />excellent results in the morning.  It is very beneficial for those times when life gets you out of sync."
This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.
"This tea has a strong pungent smell that my husband hates (he says stinky socks) but call me weird I really like it.  I like parmasean cheese too though and that stinks.  Anyhow, I find both the aroma very relaxing and find that after a cup I am tired and ready to go to bed.  I am not even sure if it is the aroma or the actual tea that is knocking me out but for some reason it is so right for this body."
Excellent Tea. I enjoy a cup every now and then. It's really aromatic as well. Shipping was fast and hassle free.
Worked great. A Good must have for breastfeeding mothers. Helped in restoring my breastmilk supply and only took two to three days. Will buy again!
"The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future."
Love this herbal tea! It's so delicious! It tastes just like Oolong Tea from the chinese restaurant minus the unhealthy tannins found in actual tea!
"I love this tea.. It was recomended to me by my Dr. to help during pregnancy.. Doesn't taste too bad with some honey, and makes me feel more relaxed."
I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like."
"I wanted good quality, fresh chamomile tea.  This one is fragrant which is a proof of freshness.  Chamomile is wonderfully calming and soothing."
"The tea taste is very good, I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy, many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus."
"Best one if you are looking for pure St John Wort Tea, all the other St John tea have other items in them hence you effects like high blood pressure get this instead it is better then a regular anti depressant and works right away"
"Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!"
"This tea is lovely for a refreshing iced tea, a comforting hot tea or mixed into a light Sangria.  'Hard to find, but worth the effort."
"I drink this tea because I love the taste and now, I still enjoy it, even though I was informed that it has some medicinal value, as well."
"The health benefits are uncertain, but this is a nice variant of another favorite, Celestial Seasonings' Cranberry Apple Zinger. The Alvita tea is tart, light, and refreshing - and Alvita has a long history making healthful products that are also surprisingly good values."
"I ordered Valerian Root tea. The price was a great deal, and shipment was really fast! I would recommend this seller to anyone, and I would definitely do business with them again."
Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !
I do not really like tea but I needed to drink it for medical reasons.  Shipping was really fast and the price was good.  I am sure those who like Sage Tea would love it.
"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!"
"This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling."
"I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea...One time I bought Senna tea out of the blue, just for the heck of it...and decided to drink it one night and the next day I was exploding downstairs.<br /><br />So I decided not to do the same with this one. This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has. Although it is suggested to drink with a meal."
My father has been drinking this tea for years. Its so good for you. Especially men.
I bought the tea for my mother who has asthma.  She said it tastes great and does wonders for her asthmas.
Received in good condition and in a timely manner.  Great for relaxing the heart.
"Prompt Service and I'm grateful to be able to order my rose hip tea on-line, from a reliable source, instead of running around from store to store looking for it."
"This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works."
"i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place. I dont know what to do with the whole 4 box, i wasnt even able to drink up the one single cup!"
"I used to get ""Juniper Ridge Juniper Ridge White Sage & Wild Mint Tea"" and LOVE it with a hint of raw honey and I wanted to give this tea a try. Very disappointed- the tea was tasteless and not what i had expected."
"Have purchased these tea bas before. I bought them in hope of having stronger . No real success, but will keep trying.<br />Received package in timely manner."
It is good and soothing to drink. I have not tried it too many times yet. I am sharing with my sister.
I had hoped this tea would taste better but it just tastes to me like I steeped weeds from the backyard.
Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
This tea smells so bad I cant get the smell outta my house.  I know Valerian root doesn't smell like roses but this smell is putrid.  The affects work ok but not the best
"If I can't find this at my local market or in a near by store, I order it from Amazon. I drink this tea after a night of drinking alcohol in order to help cleanse my liver."
I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase
"This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there."
"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
"Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother. The hassle to return is riduclous, you have to pay and it has to be thrown out anyway, Why put customer thru all this for cheap little item."
I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.
"I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this..."
It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.  Good service after their stock was replaced.<br /><br />M. Weiner
"The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?"
"In ayurvedic medidicne and in yoga exxercises some times you need to use herbal meds for balancing the chakras and energy channels, so this is one of the needed ones<br />but please use under instruction of your yoga and ayurvedic teacher"
Are you supposed to avoid sugars if you have a urinary tract infection?
Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.  I have been enjoying the tea going on one week.
This tea tastes nasty.  Maybe I just dont like sage but it made me gag!
"It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already..."
"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
"My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it."
I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.
I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.
Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly. Long time allergy suffer who loves Nettle tea. I'm able to use it & stopped all the other medications....
Many of the common brands of herbal teas are not palatable to me.  This one is very good.  I enjoy it.  Easy on the palette and easy on the digestion track.  Yum!  Just like any high quality tea.
"I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day."
"this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks"
"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas."
Used this to help slow breast milk production when I was breastfeeding.  Worked well!  I drank 3 cups a day.
"The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in."
"I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you."
"What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it."
"I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck"
If you are looking for something natural to relieve (and possible stop) hot flashes--sage tea will do it. A glass in the morning and one at night and WOW what a difference it made!
"Great product. Does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats, but seriously reduces their number and intensity. I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night."
"My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year."
"I have always wanted a natural delivery.  My friend who's had 2 other kids told me to take red raspberry tea leaf to strengthen our uterus, birth canal, etc... I started drinking this during my whole pregnancy. 1 tea bag during the first trimester and the 2nd trimester and on my third trimester, i put 2 bags, the last two weeks, i drink 2 bags every meal...<br /><br />I only had to push for 1.5 hours. didn't feel pain during contraction until 10 CM. and no epidural"
"I use red clover tea a lot and so do my friends, it helps cure insomnia and is also known as a cleanser of the body organs. I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and cheerful after I use it, which is between once a week and once a month."
Milk Thistle is said to be good for the liver. It has a very mellow and pleasant flavor. I really enjoy drinking it. Alvita brand has always had good quality teas.
"Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply."
"I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again."
We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.
"We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in."
"I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead."
"I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot."
"This tea not only  aids in digestion, but this tea also has a calming affect..it's a very relaxing tea.I drink it alone or w/honey. I always have some in my pantry. Great after a long  stressful day. I definitely recommend this product."
"I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery."
"I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable."
This is a really good tea.  I am drinking it during my pregnancy to tone the uterus.  Very good taste!
"This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now."
"A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits."
I have purchased this brand of tea before and knew the quality was great but glad to have gotten a great price also!!  Delivery was prompt and service was great!
"This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it ""worked"" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."
"I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.  As a little joke, I ordered and sent her the tea.  To my surprise, she reported that she actually liked it, mentioning it had a rather nice smooth flavor.  Although that has not stopped her from still being a dandelion ninja, I give it 5 start just knowing that if she liked it - it HAS to be good!"
"We use it at night to lower diabetes sugar and it works.  My husband has been able first to reduce the medications and now has been off for 2 months.  Of course this is together with exercise, weight reduction and proper nutrition."
"I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well."
"Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is. I will continue to use this tea. I do think it helps with your mood."
Love the aroma and the taste. Orange honey goes great with it. I drink it daily. Seems to work great when I get any stomach issues... would highly recommend this product.
"This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed.  Listen to what your body is telling you."
"I love this tea and drink it all the time. The taste is very nice and I do not even have to sweeten it or use lemon, as it has an almost sweet taste all it's own. I take alot of medicine and have much trouble with my bowels. When I drink 2 cups of your Senna tea I am opened up within 2 hours.<br />Thank you very much, I would not use that much laxative.<br /><br />Pat Kamadulski"
"I found that this tea really helped increase my milk supply. It tasted a little funny at first, but I quickly got used to it. The price on Amazon is unbeatable, especially if you use subscribe and save."
"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."
"The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again."
"I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps ""prepare"" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not."
"I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs."
I love this stuff. It has really helped me with a lot of things. I absolutely swear by it. I probably drink this tea at least once a week. Sometimes several times a day if I feel the need.
I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey...
"My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it."
"Recommend it to all.  Lovely natural sweet delicate flavor and add some raw honey is a great cold kicker.  I loved it during a URI, upper respiratory infection and it was fabulous.  Soothed my sore throat and helped ease the coughing.  I now brew it for cold tea as well.  Very refresshing."
"I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ"">Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
"I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.  They are  not individually packaged, they come in a foil lined paper lije package and there are no strings or tags, just steep add agave or honey to sweeten...it is a little bitter but not bad and drink!"
"I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells."
"I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know."
"I ordered this product because of the Dr Oz show for anti-aging, a nice by product is I swear my knee pain has improved since I started drinking a cup a day, oh yeah and it taste good."
"This is a great product to help with insomnia.  Really great.  Some do not like the smell or taste, but I actually love it.  Maybe it is an acquired test.  A+++ for this product, it is excellent."
"""They found that two of the licorice compounds, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were the most effective antibacterial substances.

I bought this product and love the flavor.  A great and relaxing way for me to end or begin a day.
"The first time I drank Fenagreek Seed tea I did not like the smell or the taste very much.  I added a very small amount of Stevia to sweeten it.  The more I drank it, the more the taste grew on me.  It is now my favorite tea by a long shot!"
"A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose."
"Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea. I'd drink it over regular black tea though."
"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."
"I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!"
"Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more."
This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it. A tea that is so good for you and will help many things in your body. My breathing felt better after the first cup. I will be buying more again soon. Doug in Calif...
"I ordered this to serve at a ""tea"" where I was speaking about roses.  It was a hit with those who were brave enough to try it."
"You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better."
Its a nice wind down at night.  Taste takes some getting used to but not too bad.  Sweeten with a litte honey.  The health benefits make up for the taste.  The product arrived as reported.
"I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?)."
"It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job."
"I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!"
It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.
I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...
"When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!"
I love this tea. It is delicious. It came in a timely manner and I was very pleased.
...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea.
This tea works for me.  It calms down my anciety and makes me sleep better.  It may not work for everyone.  Thank you!
"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you."
I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you
I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too. :)
"Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically). It was a good introduction.<br />Personally, don't care for the taste by itself, but with a bit of honey,yum! Will purchase again."
"I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go."
I didn't realize it but my tea wasn't arriving as promptly as suggested. The company also noticed and sent a box out immediately! WOW! I was very impressed!
"The tea has a mild, pleasant flavor and is easy to combine with others, without overpowering the mix. I've just moved to a new town, and I don't know where to look for the teas I need. Buying online saved me a lot of headaches. The boxes I ordered arrived promptly."
"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
"I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet. His advice? Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!"
"Tea comes in bags inside a large foil lined pouch.  There are 2 bags 'attached', and you peel them apart to use one.  They are not individually wrapped, and they do not have strings.  Strong flavor, great price."
"I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle."
"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell."

"this is a great product,it helps to relieve my bloating.I will order it again.Thank you.its better then anything else i have tryed"
"I own two cats with very different tastes in food and treats. This is the only thing they both eat and they love it!<br /><br />It's a little messy as the flakes will eventually disintegrate into a powder - and it can be expensive depending on where you buy it (my local pet store charges $8 for 1/2 an ounce, ouch!) but my cats beg for it daily and it's sure way to get their attention."
"These were bought as somewhat of a gag Christmas gift for our cat....As it turns out, she absolutely loves them! (A friend's dog also loves them) We give them to her as a daily snack and she will sit in front of the cabinet where they're kept, begging for more. It's a small price to pay for making her this happy!"
"I purchased the Cosmic Tuna Flakes, which are Cat Treats.  While my cat loves the Tuna Flakes, it took over 3 weeks for the Cosmic Firm to ship out the product.  Go with the Cat-Man Doo Extra Large Tuna Flakes.  Also a better deal."
I was expecting more smokey odor.  I guess I became spoiled by using another brand and now I know why the other is way more expensive.  I was also upset that the freshness/safety seals were not attached...I'm afraid to use the product and it cannot be returned.
"The smoky flavor is not as pronounced in this as in other brands I've used.  Inexpensive, but I think I'll put out the extra for one of the others next time."
"Jusr received this item...  Opened the package, and was terribly dissapointed.  It does not taste like or smell like smoked paprika.  I have been using smoked paprika in my cooking for years, this is not it.  This tastes and smells just like regular paprika.  Could I of gotten the wrong product?  the bottle is labeled smoked, but I am not sure what their idea of smoke is... McCormick knows what smoked paprika is, although expensive.  I thought this was too good for the money.  I guess you get what you pay for, and I paid too much here for regular paprika.  Of course this is no reflection on Amazon, still my favorite place to shop."
"I use this in meat rubs for smoking. I don't really notice a difference between regular and sweet paprika, but this is a good deal for a spice that is used a lot for meat rubs."
"I had tried every store and warehouse clubs in our area and could not find the Smoked Sweet Paprika. I gave homemade cookbooks to friends for Christmas and one of my recipes called for 1 cup of Smoked Sweet Paprika. Everyone was waiting for the book because of the BBQ ribs recipe and it called for the spice. For 4 months I looked for it. The sauce requires a cup of smoked sweet paprika. I was so thankful that I could give not only the cook book but the valuable spice that went with it as part of their Christmas Present. With instructions where to buy the spice the next time they needed it... SOOO Thankyou Amazon for helping me find that perfect last minute gift for my friends....<br />,"
"What the title says. If what you're looking for is paprika that actually smells and tastes of smoke, don't waste your money on this product."
"I felt this product was a bit grainy.  The flavor was also too subtle.  I imagined it would have a more smoky flavor, but was dissapointed by its blandness"
Rachel Ray always speak of this product. Not being able to find it in my local stores I bought on line. Great price and arrived in a little over a week.
This is wonderful  -  my son is a picky eater and everything I add a dash of the Smoked Sweet Paprika to he gobbles down.  I have even put it on Chicken in the crock pot and we loved it.<br />I would recommend this seasoning.
"Delicious, real berry licorice taste, nice chew. My new favorite. Prefer these in bag to the smaller ones in the box.  I'm tempted to hoard them all."
"This is a light, sweet, chewy licorice that bears little resemblance to US or Australian varieties.  It's Finnish, and it's got more of a gummy bear texture, though not so rubbery.  Strong flavors of strawberry with a hint of citrus, good chew.  I love it.  Tubi black tire tread and Finnska red and black licorice bites are also excellent."
"Obviously these are more expensive than regular licorice, but they taste so good. To me, they taste much less processed than other licorice."
"After you get past the weird smell and try some its not too bad. Just not going to be what you thought it was. And my biggest problem was prices of candy from online vendors. Wow. I only tried because my sister and I were talking about the old days. Hey, now I know."
Pretty good ramen.  If you add either oyster sauce or some fish sauce it'll taste a lot better! Buy some today!
These are the most delicious bars!!! I have only tasted the Banana Bread one so I can't speak to the others. They are so good and filling! They make for a quick snack/meal on the go.
"How do you get $103 for a box of 30?  The product is fabulous but I won't buy from this retailer!  That's what I would be charged if I bought each bar individually at full price in a store, maybe.... plus tax."
"even though the quality of this food and the ingedients seem to be excellent, i did not enjoy the overall appearance and taste.<br />I'm not saying is bad for everyone, but i did not like it."
"I love these cookies and my family does too.  Very tasty, light & healthy.  Can be a light breakfast, a snack or a desert."
These chips were incrediblt tasty and not salty at all.They went well with drinks or dip and didn't fill us up to much if had for a snack before dinner.I will definitely order them again and woul recommend them to everyone.
This is a very tasty rice cake -- the tamari gives it a nice salty flavor that goes very well with the sesame and rice.  This is a regular staple of my diet and I never seem to get tired of them.  That's saying something because I can't think of any other variation of rice cake that I actually like; most a almost tasteless.<br /><br />I've ordered these several times and Finally they came double boxed.  This is very important because they do break easily and some previous shipments had a disappointing amount of breakage.  Glad the Amazon warehouse got it right.  Thanks.
"These have been a real life saver for me. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy and when I start to feel sick I eat one the these rice cakes. Within a couple of minutes I feel back to my old self again. I love the flavor of these rice cakes, it's just enough so that you actually want to eat them, but not too strong to upset my stomach. I just wish I had thought to order more before I was down to my last rice cake, but thanks to Amazon Prime I'm having them sent overnight delivery, yes, they are that good."
"As someone with celiac disease, these rice cakes are the greatest.  They have a fine, subtle flavor, aren't too salty; sesame seeds add interest, and they're safe for me and better for the environment than conventionally grown products.  Highly recommended!!"
"I've missed croutons for so long.  A few months back, I ordered a package of Edward & Sons croutons from Food Fight! Vegan Grocery and fell in love.  They are so yummy and have no nasty animal products.  Plus, if I recall correctly, they're actually low in calories and fat.  As one who can overdo it with all the ""extras,"" this was a huge perk!  They're light, crispy and not drenched in grease.  Highly recommended.  :)))"
These are really exceptionally good croutons. We enjoyed them a lot. They take up dressing well and are a wonderful complement to salads & soups. They are even enjoyable as a snack-right out of the bag!! Great flavor!
"I'm used to croutons being light and crunchy.  These seem overly hard.  The taste is ok, but a little bland when I compare it to other brands.  But then again the other brands aren't organic made.  I do find I like them on soup, cause they soften up a bit.  On salad though, it was just too hard."
"These ruined my dinner.  I bought these croutons for a special poultry dish. The croutons smelled ""off"" when I first open the bags (I bought two), but I didn't think anything about it.  However, when I tried a couple, they left a really bad after-taste. The expiration date was okay; I thought maybe it was just a different type of seasoning and proceeded to use them in my dish.<br />However, when I served my guests, some took a few bites and didn't touch it again, filling up on the bread and side dishes.  After one bite, I was disgusted with the taste, which was definitely the croutons, but much more potent--they took over the dish! I took the unused portion of the 2nd bag and took it back to the grocery store for a refund.  I must have gotten a bad batch, but won't buy them again."
"Unless you truely need to have organic and for some reason must eat croutons, I would not recommend these.  They are very bland and very hard.  We would prefer to have no croutons on our salad before these."
"Out of the gold foil package, this matcha smells amazingly fruity. Super fruit amazing! The smell reminds me of really tarty berry yogurt. Brazilian Acai matcha appears slightly darker in powder form.<br /><br />I prepared this as a traditional hot cup. This matcha didn't froth up very well nor maintain froth, but I didn't really care. Interestingly, this matcha prepared has a different colour than normal, a dark forest green, probably from the acai berry powder. By the way, I used 1/4tsp plus 175f water.<br /><br />The taste of  Brazilian Acai matcha is quite fruity. A mix between a tropical flavor and blackberries or blueberries. There is also a natural sweetness to this matcha - adding any additional sweetener would be overkill I think. With the fruityness and natural sweetness, this hot cup is very refreshing! There is no tart or bitterness to this matcha! I honestly was expected this to taste tart or puckery.<br /><br />In the end, this was surprisingly good! Is this matcha totally cheating with getting a double whammy of healthy energizing matcha and acai? Don't pass up this matcha - I'm thinking this is up there on being one of my fav flavors from Red Leaf Teas!"
"Okay, so, fair warning. I'm not overly familiar with the acai berry or how it should taste. I've had acai berry/blueberry juice before, and loved it, so I'm hoping I'll love the berry on its own. Of course now, all I can think of when it comes to this tea is RuPaul's Drag Race with all the different queens trying to say ""acai"" for a TV commercial. It's like the Pink Dragonfruit from Tealish. I've never had dragonfruit, but it smelled amazing and so I tried it and I loved it. Now I'm on the hunt for an actual dragonfruit to try. So while I can tell if I like the tea and if it tastes good or not, I have no real way to tell if it tastes like the actual fruit at all. But that's okay! Everyone should be open to new experiences, and I am looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Okay, yum! It's kind of like blueberry on steroids? I don't know, it's got this amazing berry flavor with a round tartness....yes, round. It was the word that came to mind as I sipped it. It's just...lovely and unexpected. The flavor is very bold and very...unique. I don't quite know how to describe it, but I liked it. I definitely want to try more acai flavored things if this is what I have to look forward to! I'm not sure if I need to restock on this ASAP, but it's definitely in the running for my must-have list."
"Wooooow<br />I love this tea!  This is the product, that can be really good for the body: it possesses the antioxidant, and vitamins. In addition, it also tastes good. You must try this tea, and you will not be disappointed."
I've been buying these for years and was delighted to find them on Amazon.  Super value here.
Very mild compared to the other flavors. My kid wants it in her lunch-box and prefers to eat it rather than have a sandwich. Great with dips or all by itself as a snack.
"I don't buy these Macy's Cheese Sticks often, but it seems as if there are changes to the packaging each time.  The last time I had bought a supply, I was put off by the fact that the entire shipment was exceptionally dry and the ""Melting Parmesan"" was more like ""Crunchy Crackly Whatsit"".  This shipment (and I trust that the other 11 boxes are the same) was truly what it claimed (a pleasure).  On the other hand, the packaging wasn't up to par.  Many products today use a laudable packaging technique which provides the buyer with a means of locking the package closed, and this package is no exception.  Except that the Cheese Sticks package doesn't accomplish that which may have been intended.  I'm compelled to use a paper clip or rubber band if I want the package to remain closed."
These sell in organic shops and deli's for twice what you will pay on Amazon.  They are always a hit at parties or family get togethers so you will need a case which is what Amazon sells.
"This product is great! With that said it would have to sell for $22.80 per 12 pack to make it worth while to buy. I can get these all day long for $2.00 per can. That would put a 12 pack at $24.00 and that still wouldn't get me to bite! Fix the price, and sell this stuff!!"
I have used Lipton tea for the past 40 years and the tea bag was the best improvement ever made.  Keep up the good work.  Except for twice a year Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase the family size bags.  Of course Prime shipping is a plus also
My dogs love these healthful and delicious biscuits.  The assorted flavors are exciting.  Buying in quantity through Amazon.com is a cost saver and convenient.
"We got these as gifts for our friends dogs after great success on the mini-sized ones for our guys.<br /><br />One of our dogs is really a picky eater. It sometimes helps if we crumble up a bit of one of these bones to sprinkle around his dinner.<br /><br />Between these and pupperonis, our pups seem content (all the human table scraps don't seem to go unappreciated either)."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6GAMK"">McKay's Chicken Style Instant Broth & Seasoning, Vegan, 12 oz</a><br /><br />This product states that it is ""a complete vegan product""; however, the 3rd ingredient on the label is ""lactose (milk)"" and the 4th ingredient is ""whey (milk)"". Animal products are not vegan! It shouldn't be a hit for a vegan broth search on Amazon, either. I am sending this one back!"
"I've tried many different vegetarian broths over the last 3 years and McKay's brand is, by far, the best! I have both the chicken and beef style and use them frequently. I highly recommend these products. I was able to find these products easily at local health food stores for a VERY affordable price. I recently made french onion soup with the beef style broth and it was impressive! A definate upside to buying the powder is you can make the broth as weak or strong as you'd like. Only 1 tsp per cup! It's MUCH cheaper than buying canned broth."
"McKay's Chicken Style seasoning is a wonderful vegan replacement for chicken broth in just about any recipe.  I have used it for years, and my cupboard is never without it."
"I have never eaten any kind of meat and as such am very particular when I shop for food items, making sure there isn't lard, chicken fat, or any other type of animal product in my food.  I grew up with my mother using McKay's and know of no other product that is as tasty a substitute for chicken or beef seasoning.  It is a difficult product to find locally in the store's where I live, even in the health food stores, so I'm glad I can find it on Amazon."
"McKay's offers 3 different chicken versions;  msg, no msg, and vegan.  The item pictured is the no-msg variety, which is not vegan.  The vegan product says ""vegan"" in the spot where this one says ""no msg"".  Don't buy this if you want vegan. I believe this is an Amazon error in confusing two similar products. I find the msg most flavorful, then the no msg, then the vegan, but I like them all.  I am averaging the 5 star flavor with 1 star inaccurate description as anyone wanting vegan would not consider the other products acceptable."
"I use this seasoning in all sorts of recipes, but especially soups.  There's nothing else out there that is close to this, in my opinion."
"this seasoning is soooooooooooo flavor-full.<br />you can use it on any food.  i use it everyday in everything.  for breakfast, its great on grits and hashbrowns.  for lunch it is so good in all soups.  for supper, just sprinkle your plate of veggies."
I own a health food cafe that caters to vegetarian and vegan customers. I use McKay's Vegan Chicken Broth exclusively in my soup recipes. My new chef was very skeptical that any vegan chicken broth would have good flavor but when I made him take a blind taste test and he chose McKay's He agreed to use it exclusively as well. McKay's Vegan Chicken Broth is a fantastic product.
"Great product, though we wish it was a bit cheaper! We paid less the first time we ordered less than a year ago."
"This is my favorite vegetarian Chicken-style seasoning. It really makes a great substitute for chicken broth in recipes, and it's great that it's both vegan and gluten-free."
Great stuff but the shipping costs will kill ya. I wish they would sell it at a store near me.
"It's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review on a product, but I didn't like this at all.  It didn't taste like chicken broth, and it didn't even taste good to make up for that fact.  I feel like I wasted my money."
I used to harvest bee honey in the past and verify that this product is pure honey. It is difference from honey sold in store that mix with syrup to prevent bee honey from being crystallized.
"Rather an unusual taste. Not particularly ""honey"" flavored, yet recognizably honey. It has a wild type taste and not particularly sweet."
"I HEARD THAT BUCKWHEAT HAS MORE ANTIOXIDANTS IN IT THAN BLUEBERRIES, AND I WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM SUGAR AND SUGAR SUBSTITUTES IN MY MORNING COFFEE.  I NOW USE BUCKWHEAT HONEY IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF SUGAR. IT TASTES WONDERFUL AND I GET MY ANTIOXIDANTS ALL AT THE SAME TIME."
"I have purchased this same product from a couple of different places and find that each time I order it, the flavor is different and the texture of the honey is different.  Sometimes it is more crystalized and sometimes more paste like and very thick.  To soften, I microwave the bottle w/o the lid for about 20 sec. on high and it allows me to take a knife to it and mix it so that it is more spreadable.  I like the strong flavor whether consistant or not...."
"To honey connoisseurs: This is a small can of a real raw buckwheat honey. I give it a five start rating as it carries the real taste of buckwheat blossom honey, meaning that the bees weren't fed a substitute (although in today's world anything is possible). The honey is creamy, suggesting some kind of processing. But even then, the product is delicious and flavorfull. I will definitely re-order it when I am done with this jar."
"I've tried many various honeys, but I keep coming to buckwheat. It is my favorite, and this YS honey is a fine representative of that. This honey is very tasteful and aromatic. I love the richness of taste of buckwheat honey. It is not just sweet, it has some sour notes and a variety of flavor I can't really describe. If you haven't tried such honey, I urge you do it!"
I DON'T THINK THIS WAS AS FRESH AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN  Got another at a much cheaper price at another site and it was very fresh.
"These are a great buy!<br /><br />The olives are of uniform size and color.  They are flavorful and fresh tasting.  They also arrived in good shape, something that doesn't always happen when you buy bulk packages."
"I've bought Nicoise olives at grocers and gourmet shops for 30+ years.  They have always been black and tasted good to incredible.  Very few of the olives in this six pound can were black, mostly ranging in color from green to brown. One was yellow.  They are nearly tasteless, except for having far too much salt.  Buy a handful of Nicoise olives elsewhere and enjoy them.  This can is a ripoff."
"I used to buy these olives at gourmet stores for around $11.00 a tub, which is about one cup.  Much better deal here. They are small and very tasty.  Not overpowering.  Good things come in small packages!"
"These olives are both too salty and too small, not worth the effort to eat them.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXMNBQ"">Roland Nicoise Olives from France, 6.1-Pound Can</a>  I don't know what makes them Nicoise, exactly, but they do not add a specifically French flavor to anything, just more salt than you would want if you pursue a healthy diet."
"The tiny little containers of wheat grass / cat grass that you see in the grocery stores and pet stores (ranging in price from $2.99 to $6.99!) are ridiculous, when you can get this 5 pound bucket for $15 or so and have it last for a long time.  I purchased The Sprout House Hard Wheat for Wheatgrass Sprouting Seeds about a month ago, and I can already see this is going to last me for awhile.  I have a recycled wheatgrass container from one of those grocery stores, and each batch takes less than 1/4 cup of wheat grass seeds to grow the same amount.  I'm literally growing the same amount of grass for pennies.  It's so easy to grow this for my cats, that I'm thinking about buying a manual juicer and growing some for us as well!<br /><br />The only down-side to this bucket is how hard it was to get the lid off!  But the opposite point is that it closes VERY securely, so you can be assured of keeping your seeds dry and free from contaminants.<br /><br />All around, I find this an excellent purchase and if / when I run out, I'll be sure to order from The Sprout House again!"
"This wheatgrass grows itself. I load a shallow tray with dirt, add fertilizer, fill it with seeds, lightly cover with more dirt,water and thick wheatgrass in 7 days. What's not to like?!"
"The seed is fine. Grows well, stands up under my cat's grazing. But... the bucket is almost impossible to open. The instructions for opening it do not apply to reality. Very frustrating and exhausting by the time it is finally opened. Required screw drivers for levers and several other tools I don't recall. Now the lid no longer sits securely on the bucket. Not so sure I am willing to do this again."
I've planted the first batch of wheat grass for my cat. Germination is fast and rate is high. My cat loves his little salary bowl. The price is hard to beat - the best price I found on the internet. I plan to order some other seeds for myself for sprouting.
"Prior to purchasing a five pound bucket of The Sprout House's Hard Wheat Organic Sprouting Seeds, I was paying roughly half as much for five meager ounces of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HAVPLO"">Petlinks System Nibble-Licious Seeds</a>, which I had very little luck growing.  At that price per ounce, it certainly didn't leave much room for experimentation, much less perfecting cat grass based growing techniques.<br /><br />After purchasing five pounds of organic seeds from The Sprout House, I know how to grow wheatgrass like a champ and still have at least four pounds of seeds left.  The method that works best for me is to soak the seeds overnight in a mason jar (with a homemade sprouting lid), completely drain the jar the next morning and then rinse the seeds every few hours until they've sprouted nicely.  At that point, I put a very shallow layer (about half an inch) of organic soil in a seed tray, layer the sprouted seeds on top, moisten the soil and seeds, cover with a sheet or two of wet newspaper & make sure the soil and paper stay damp (but not overly wet).  In a few days, the grass is high enough to push the newspaper off, at which point, I let it have ambient light.  In a few more days, I've got a thick (and gorgeous), miniature lawn for my cats to graze on.<br /><br />I only use about 3/4 cup of seeds for a seed tray that's roughly 10"" x 21"", so it's obviously a lot of grass for the money (especially given the insane cost of pre-grown cups of cat grass sold in pet stores).  My point is that even if you don't have a green thumb or have been put off by the thought of growing your own cat grass (or people grass), five pounds of seeds will be enough to prove how easy and cost effective it is to grow yourself.<br /><br />And yes, the bucket is awkward and hard to open, but there isn't any law that says you have to keep these seeds in the bucket."
Wheat grass sprouts are not the tastiest but they are healthy and beneficial. I used these seeds to sprout and eat and also to sprout and grow as wheat grass and they worked great for both.  They are fresh seeds and i would say i got about a 100% success rate with the seeds.  Sprouthouse has quality seeds and some decent pricing.
"Wow, this bucket contains a ton of wheatgrass seeds. It will probably last us a year. We sprout our own and grow in our garage under a light system. I had to have my husband break open the container for me, but now it is easy to open and close. I would recommend this and will buy again."
These were my first wheatgrass seeds - and I wasn't disappointed.  They come in a nice little bucket and they sprout and grow like crazy.  Very good wheatgrass too.  What's not to like?
"The 2 star rating is because what you appear to see is not what you will receive, unless someone has started to make a less than 1 gallon container that looks exactly like a 5 gallon container, I have never seen one but I suppose it is possible. What you appear to see is a 5 gallon container, so please look close before you buy. I have been buying Hard Winter Wheat seeds for YEARS. The container displayed for this item appears, especially when compared to others selling a 5 gallon containers of Wheatgrass seeds, to be a 5 gallon pail. yet with this item you get only 5 pounds. 5 pounds of hard wheat seeds will not even come close to filling a 5 gallon pail. Every time I have bought a 5 gallon container of Wheatgrass Seeds it has had 35 pounds of Wheatgrass seeds in it, NOT 5 POUNDS. The Sprout House may very well have a high quality seed, but deceiving the buying public, in my opinion, is wrong and needs to be revealed, hopefully before even one person is deceived. If you search for hard wheat seed on Amazon you will see other companies selling containers that look EXACTLY like this one that contain 35 and not 5 pounds of seed, and the cost per pound is much closer to what it should be than this 5 pound container is. Maybe this was an honest mistake and not intentional. If that is the case, I am sure the mistake will be corrected. If I see that it is corrected I will modify or delete this review. But PLEASE, always do your research before you buy so what you expect to receive is what you do receive."
"my cat has been eating this grass for the last few years...  excellent price on Amazon.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, have been brave enough to try wheat grass juice."
I purchased this whole-bean Kona-blend coffee for my mother as a gift.  She said it is very delicious.  I thought it was very reasonably-priced.
This was a great deal! they taste fresh and they were intact and shiny and at a great bulk price! I used them in my wedding favor bags for 300 guests and I put white and gold 5 pieced in each bag. They were a hit!
"I was excited when I read the positive reviews, but when my almonds arrived a lot of them were crushed/broken.  It was a big disappointment and they were not particularly good.  Unfortunate buy on my end!  Maybe back in 2009 they were great, but my experience was not."
"Ordered these for our wedding.  A great bargain to order in bulk.  The guests complimented them as well!  I was nervous ordering online because checking in stores there were always some bags with almonds that were crushed and broken yet were more expensive.  But these arrived in good shape, not stale and perfect for guests."
These are the worst ever!  no taste except sawdust.....Don't buy.  Best quality was what they said..forget it...no quality is what it should have said
This whole seed mustard is hot like a French Dijon.  Great for sandwiches!
"I love this stuff - didn't know it had High Fructose Corn Syrup in it!  Grrrr<br />This is not product specific, but I have noticed that when I buy bulk on Amazon some of the companies ship out their close-dated items.  We purchase for our large family to save money, but it does not save anything to have to throw out what is out-dated after a short time.  I wish there was some way to communicate and find out what the products are dated are when I purchase here."
"I don't know why my grocery store quit carrying this mustard - they carry several other Beaver Brand Mustards, just not the Deli Mustard.  After asking for 2 different stores to order/carry it for me, and waiting while they attempted to order it, I finally gave up and found it here.<br /><br />It's a whole grain mustard with horseradish and I use it all the time for brats, knocks, and even for my corned beef, which everyone wants the recipe for (secret - the mustard & brown sugar!).<br /><br />Now I have to order it, 6 bottles at a time, but I don't care because I always have it on hand!"
"if you like it spicy ths is it! use it without  any other ingredient to make it hotter, ideal for fish, chicken, pork and vegetables."
"Good quality of tea, very refreshing and calming effect to close a hard working day. Good taste, it is spicy and rewarding. We received it with a fast delivery and it is a good product for the money."
"I purchased an Axion 7"" TV & wanted some protection for the unit when in storage or travel. Working great distances from home, I choose to pack a little house & stay near the jobsite. To kill time, I like to watch TV. I've had only a couple of them due to my insistence on buying good quality units. To assure these units I purchase last, I buy the protective covers that also act as a storage for the accommodating accessories too. That way there is less chance of equipment loss. How many times have I ran across a cord or a plug that I asked: ""where did this go to?"". Only to find the answer a few weeks later, after I've thrown it away.<br /><br />I'd say this denim case could be used for the small note books or Acer mini laptop. It is a stiff case & offers some protection. I wouldn't give it the Samsonite test however."
"I had a friend of mine eating these opposite me at dinner the other day and I requested a taste for myself. Great mild flavour in both the fish and the tomato sauce. Just right in my opinion. I've ordered a doz cans of the stuff myself. I had them on sour dough toast, was divine!"
"Disappointed and afraid to buy again, because these are so salty. Anybody else find this? Won't buy again. The tomato sauce is nice and flavorful, but a bad slip up to be so very salty."
"These have to be the world's best sardines--no sardine odor and no oil.  They are imported from Portugal where they are processed as soon as they are caught, so they don't have time to go stale, which is what causes the bad odor in cheap cans of sardines at the stores."
"Shipped UPS which was unexpected so I had to end up paying extra to have them reroute it to my job so I could actually be there to sign for it instead of getting notices that nobody was home and they would be back at another hour. Outside of that, tasty tasty! I will always prefer Lavaza to Illy 10x over. Just smoother and richer on the senses without that dark acidity that I just can't stand. And I know people complain about too little foam but I don't care about foam (I think foam tastes disgusting) so this was perfect!"
Syrup of Cassis is hard to find.  Most people settle for Creme de Cassis which is alcohol based.  But the non- alcoholic syrup doesn't overwhelm the wine.
I lived in France for over a year and used this to make kir and kir royal.  I was very excited to see that it was for sale and the same product you can get overseas.
"This is legitimate cassis, just like in France.  It is definitely worth buying, except for the price.  The price Amazon is selling this for is a bit high."
"It's a great mixture of greens. My son started it when he was 8 month old. Since it has a nice chunky texture and a very healthy recipe, I still offer it to him now when he is 15 m.o. And he loves it!"
My baby Loves this and I am coming back for more!  Great protein and I tasted it too it is very tasty! I would highly recommend this.
"This looked very promising and is certainly very healthy, but my 8 month old won't eat it.  At best, she took a few bites when I mixed it with formula, but she really didn't like it."
"Baby loved this one, and I liked giving him protein without subjecting him to pureed meat!  It is definitely a thicker texture.  My baby started eating this at 7.5 months and did fine."
"Baby was just ok with this one, slow to eat it and didn't finish.  I thought it was great though..."
"I first tried Prima Taste's Rendang Curry and love it, which made me try the Kebab Satay. This satay sauce is to die for, really great if you have people over and want to ""cook"" authentic Asian Cuisine. Its really easy to use as well. You just open all the packets and mix it together. I've started using this for chicken, beef and now even shrimp and highly recommend."
"I love this tea - lovely flavor, not bitter or bland. And the company's great too - they work with fair trade growers.  I recommend giving it a try."
"After losing two full belt holes of girth around my middle in only 2 weeks after following the Wheat Belly diet  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609611543"">Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</a> ) I decided to give up wheat flour entirely, and have had some trouble finding a suitable flour for baking.<br /><br />I originally used chana dal flour (also known as ""gram flour,"" ""garbanzo bean flour,"" or ""chick pea flour"". This flour, made from chickpeas, is available at any Indian grocery or here on Amazon under one of those names).  I continued to lose weight by using chana dal flour but it has a somewhat bitter taste.<br /><br />I then tried the Chebe line of flours ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACNWY8"">Chebe Bread All-Purpose Mix, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>  ) which is manioc (tapioca) flour.  Very good, highly recommended, but the dough gets very chewy.<br /><br />I then tried cooking with just this coconut flour, in total disregard of the package instructions, which recommends not using this flour on its own but instead substituting a quarter of your regular flour with this.  Big mistake to ignore the package directions.  It wouldn't stick together and soaked up a huge amount of water.  Total disaster.<br /><br />I'm now doing as the package recommends and I genuinely love this flour.  It's totally delicious and I wish I could use it on its own, but it's just not realistic.  I'm now using a coconut flour-Chebe blend, with occasional coconut flour-chana dal flour days.  And I keep losing weight without any other changes to my diet."
"If you are a low carber or even a weight watchers and you miss having cake, get yourself some of this product.<br />1 egg (for WW use 3 egg whites), 2 tbsp Coconut flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a splash of vanilla, splenda to taste ( I generally use a couple of packets, but if you are using liquid it will be different, Mix this together and cook in a glass cereal bowl about 2 minutes in the microwave and you have cake! Top with a little greek yogurt or cream cheese sweetened with artificial sweetner and it's yummy!"
"This is the second time I've ordered this coconut flour. It's great to bake with. This is my favorite recipe to make with it. I have also used this basic recipe and leave out the chocolate and make a raspberry zinger like cake by spreading sugar free raspberry jam on top of the cake batter and sprinkling unsweetened coconut flakes on top before baking. I buy most of my baking supplies at Netrition because it's cheaper and only costs four ninety five for shipping no matter how much you buy. Here's the recipe for the coconut cake. I use 3 eggs and a little more coconut milk and use whatever sugar substitute you like. I use a mix of liquid splenda, erythritol and stevia extract.<br /><br /> Chocolate Almond Joy Cake<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />4 eggs<br />¾ cup canned coconut milk<br />2 teaspoons almond extract<br />¾ cup coconut palm sugar<br />½ cup blanched almond flour<br />½ cup coconut flour<br />¼ teaspoon sea salt<br />½ teaspoon baking soda<br />¼ cups unsweetened shredded coconut<br />1 bar of 72% chopped dark chocolate<br /><br />1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, coconut milk, almond extract and palm sugar with a mixer.<br />2. In a smaller bowl, combine almond flour, coconut flour, salt and baking soda.<br />3. Slowly add dry ingredients into wet with a mixer.<br />4. Stir in ½ cup of the chocolate chips.<br />5. Grease an 8×8 inch baking dish.<br />6. Pour batter into dish, then sprinkle shredded coconut and remaining chocolate chips on top.<br />7. Bake at 350° for 30 minutes. (Enjoy the smell of toasted coconut wafting through the house!)<br />8. Cool for 1 hour.<br />9. Serve."
"OK, be sure you know this is really just ground up dried coconut!  It is NOT exchangeable with regular flour!  One must read about how to use it for success in baking.  However, if you think of it as protein powder, or a substitute for corn starch, it is easy to figure out.  A couple teaspoons in a smoothie, a little in the pan to thicken a sauce.  If you want to bake with it, there are recipes in cookbooks, many for free online - coconutoil.com, and coconuttraditions.com, I think. (Google it)  I mix a little in my kid's ""just add water"" pancake mix, with an egg,  a little melted coconut oil, some ground almond flour and whole milk or almond milk...it makes the best pancakes and waffles, a lot more flavor and texture, with a lot of added healthful things.  I am going to give it a try in muffins, I will follow the recipe as I have read enough reviews that this is not the place to ""wing it"" as I usually do!  But love the smell and I can't wait to taste it in baked goods!"
"I use coconut flour all of the time for baking.  I especially line the canister it comes in, so it stays fresher longer.  I also keep in the fridge.  Coconut secret coconut flour seems especially lighter & fluffier than other coconut flours that I've tried.  I was very pleased with this product & I will definitely purchase it again."
I thought this flour worked very well in our grain and sugar free zucchini bread recipe.  It holds a lot of moisture and is very dense but tasted good. I think it is nice to have such great options for grain free baking.  My co workers tried it and said if I hadn't told them they wouldn't have known it was any different than regular zucchini bread.
"I ordered this after reading about how healthy it is, and the food I bake with it actually comes out tasting very good. If you aren't totally grain-free/paleo, you can still benefit from the healthy aspect of this. My banana bread recipe is below:<br /><br />3 large ripe bananas<br />1 egg, well beaten<br />3/4 c. sugar<br />3 tbsp. butter, melted<br />1.5 c. (whole wheat) flour<br />1/2 c. coconut flour<br />1/2 c. water (or as needed to reach proper consistency)<br />1 tsp. soda<br />1 tsp. baking powder<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />Walnuts (optional)<br /><br />Mash bananas well and mix with beaten egg. Add sugar and mix thoroughly. Melt butter and add to the banana mixture. Sift together remaining dry ingredients and add to banana mixture. Bake in a greased 5x9 inch pan (2 lb. loaf pan) or two smaller pans. Bake at 350° for 1 hr. If using smaller pans, bake for 40 min. Bread is done when toothpick comes out cleanly."
"I'm new to cooking without wheat/grains so it was a bit awkward at first. Though I have to say I love this product. If you want something to make breads for sandwiches I would not suggest this. It's great for making sweets though. Coconut flour is dense and requires more liquid than a wheat flour so that took some getting use to, but as a product this is excellent. It has a great flavor and aroma. I do suggest you keep baked products in the fridge though as I've found that coconut flour products spoil easier than wheat flour ones. I'm not sure why but it just seems that way."
"It makes great smoothies with fresh, rich coconut scent and taste!<br />I'm a vegan and i mix it with soymilk and its a wonder! I purchased this product from a different site and was surprised it has almost no review here. Will buy again!"
I just placed my third order of this product and this time I bought two! It tastes excellent and its really good for you. I have substituted it into all of my baking and I make protein bars with it. When I make pancakes in the morning with it I can eat one medium sized pancake with Agave Nectar on top with some whey powder mixed in and it keeps me full and energized until dinner time!!! Enjoy!
"I am quite happy with the product. I use it in paleo-friendly recipes. It's like a sponge though, soaks up a lot of liquid. If you are using it as a substitute for regular flour you may need to increase your eggs/liquid!"
"This Stuff is Fantastic,  of course if you're expecting a grain texture you will be disappointed as it is slightly more corse the wheat flour but not enough to discourage use in baking. it has a slightly nutty /sweet flavor and is easy on a post WLS tummy. i use it for baking protein muffins and its fabulous...<br />Manda"
Used this coconut flour to make my first grain-free baked good--a grain-free carrot cake! It turned out wonderfully. Delicious and moist.
"So far I have only used this product in Smoothies, but it is quite excellent.  It makes the smoothie more substantial and adds extra nutrition along the way.  Highly recommend."
"Good stuff!  I was trying to find a good quality but reasonably-priced coconut flour for my muffins, and I did!  This is perfect in muffins and lets me get away from wheat products. Highly recommended!"
I'm not crazy about the texture of that I got when making gravy and my pancakes did not set up like they should have. They were like potato cakes. Not sure that I will pay that much for flour in the future.
I was looking everywhere for an affordable coconut flour to try this kind of flour for the first time and found this for just $5.99. Great product and great price!
"I got this specifically for use in gluten-free baking, for a low carb option.  I generally stick to whole grains and nut meals for baking and wanted to use coconut flour to lighten it up a bit, change the flavor.  This is the first one I've used, so I don't have a basis of comparison to other brands.<br /><br />I do not bake with only this flour, but cut into others.  It is a bit sweet, so I cut back on my overall sweetener in the recipe.  As well, it leaves a slight coconut flavor, but not enough to interfere with the overall dish.  I am very pleased with the texture and  flavor.<br /><br />As well, this was my first add-on purchase through Amazon.  Interesting concept.  No question the low price is why I got this brand, and I liked that I didn't have to buy 4 pounds of it and risk not liking it.  The product and the add-on option were a good fit to try out the small quantity.  Definitely recommend both."
This product was priced the same as stores near me but none of them had it in stock. Good product.
"Given as a gift to a person who takes delight in coconut and in cooking. So, how could I go wrong with this!  She's happy to have it and excited to put it to use."
"This is a very good natural product for helping with bloating, irregularity, and constipation.  It tastes great and works.  I was recently told about this product by a person who loves it.  I wish I knew about it before now!"
"Really like the tea, and it did cause moderate weight loss, however, it also caused intestinal upset which it said it wouldn't."
Absolute best hot sauce in my book. Has a nice sweet start and settles into a fiery spice that'll last longer than most. Use wisely!
"I first experienced this Hot Sauce back in 2004 when stationed in Florida, there's a sub shop that I miss called Firehouse Subs.  Essentially great subs with tons of unique Hot Sauces on the bar you can try.<br /><br />While not very hot, this has a simple and enjoyable flavor mainly derived from mustard.  I have never been able to buy this in stores, but I'm glad I found it on Amazon.  The packaging was also a great job by the seller Hot Sauces 'n more.<br /><br />If you love sauces but want something minus the kick, you can use this on almost anything.  Absolutely must buy!"
This jam is very good.  The pricing on the other hand is very high by the time you pay for shipping.
"This Marionberry jelly has got to be the BEST jelly and even tho it had to be ordered from Oregon, was worth every penny of the shipping costs.  I buy a half dozen at a time and it goes fast, I think a dozen jars would be a better purchase.  It is so great on English Muffins as well as toast that its a Sunday treat!!"
this almost has a sweet taste right out of the bottle -- so much so that I double checked to make sure it did not have sugar in it (which it did not)<br /><br />Definately recommend!!
"Everything was grt  but when I was ordering the label said stage 4 and when I receive this it was stage 2. My kids still liked it ,but they r older kids and I prefer to have higher stages... Overall its a good food and very healthy for kids... I wish I could find this in local store, but amazon has been grt in delivering these items on time with super saving shipping."
"Like always Nestle is a brand we can trust, it is so healthy and yummy my kids love it and I am so happy that they get all the vitamins and minerals they need."
This is NOT a wheat free food so should not be in the Gluten free search!  Just BE careful to read the FULL description of everything before you purchase!
This is the best and most wonderful smelling tea I have ever had. The price is right because it lasts a long time.
I  have bought this tea for years but recently the company changed the product.  They seem to have added too much bergamot and the tea is very unpleasant.
This Cranberry Mustard is wonderful for turkey sandwiches !!  I had it first at Max's Opera Cafe in San Francisco and was excited to find it on Amazon.
Had my doubts about this as the color was darker than any I had seen.  Thought the cranberry might be over powering.  Was very pleasantly surprised. Cranberry mustard is a product that is not easily found and generally expensive.  Can't beat this for the money. Would recommend!!
This condiment is one I keep in my desk at work.  Sometimes I stop by a local grocery chain deli and pick up a pre-made sandwich for lunch since I know I won't have time to go out. The Beaver Brand Cranberry Mustard really dresses up an ordinary turkey breast sandwich. A nice combination of tart/sweet cranberry plus the zing of good deli mustard.
"This mustard was on the table at Milton's (a deli style restaurant iin Del Mar, CA. I loved it and bought a bottle to take home. I was happy to find that I wouldn't have to drive back to Del Mar to get some more.<br />The price is great on Amazon and the product is wonderful."
I looked high and low for this in the stores...not available..Thank god I could purchase it through the internet...<br />I use this for not only sandwiches...but i can get really creative..like salad dressing...It is sooo good...
"I had this for the first time at a deli in my hometown. I've since moved and pined for it for nearly 10 years. Just found a grocery store that has it! It's sweet, tangy, and wonderful!"
The coffee shop next door to my old job made a great turkey sandwich with cranberry mustard and I assumed since we live in Portland that it must be this mustard (since it comes from Beaverton).  I don't think this was the one I was looking for - it had a lot of mustard seeds which I don't care for.  But it was still pretty tasty!  I shipped the rest of the bottles off as presents to family.
Thyis was the third time I  have ordered this product. I am very pleased by the price and quality and the fast shipping time. I highly recomend this product and this company.
I love cranberries and mustard! BUT this combo tastes like mustard with maybe one cranberry that ran through! IT is good but not fruity enough.
"This is a great mustard, has a little more bite than others that I have tried. Goes great on Roast Pork sandwiches and as a topping on hamburgers. I like it best for its low salt content."
Great mustard! Place in a ramekin next to cheeses and meats.  Works with anything!
"I'm an avid fan of the B.B. honey sweet mustard and the B.B. hot mustard. I ordered a case of this mustard thinking it would be as great as the others and because we often times mix the honey sweet mustard with cranberry sauce.  Quite honestly, neither my husband nor I care for this product much.  I can't explain exactly why but we just don't care for the taste.  I'm thinking I might use it for marinades and spice it up a bit or use it for glazes.  But as a garnish for meats or veggies it just doesn't make the mustard."
Our cat liked this.  It took her a while to get used to it.  I think this product is quite expensive.
"My cats do love this stuff. They are extremely picky too and prefer dry food. ""First cats I ever met that act this way, I don't get it either."" I love the price so it's perfectly fine with me too! I have them on it two times a week because everyday is a little much on the litter box and their tummies. Oh starting out give them just a little and not a whole can... A lot of people make this mistake. If they aren't used to something they will get sick."
"I'm very impressed . It's hard to find a quality cat food that my cats actually love the flavor. My cats also get bored with flavor of most cat foods, but they really enjoy this food and don't get tired of it."
A neighbor made this soup mix for us and brought it over.  She added pre-made chicken and a bag of frozen vegetables.  It was the best chicken noodle soup we have ever had. She said it was easy to make and such a nice gift for us!
"My family and I received this in a gift basket for Christmas.  I had never seen or heard of this company before.  One night, I was in need of something quick and comforting, and I decided to try it.  We all loved it - my 2 yr old and my 6 yr old included.  It's literally the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had!  It was very easy to make too.  My only reccomendation would be to put 1 cup less of chicken broth than the instructions say... it makes the soup less brothy and more hearty."
"I had been ordering Frontier soups directly from Frontier.  My two favorites are the Chicken Noodle and the Potato Leek soups.  When I saw I could order at lower cost from Amazon, and both my favorites were available, I promptly did so.  Much better value with Amazon, and no shipping when I used the $25 free shipping super saver."
I have made one pot of this soup and it was good... not homemade but good.<br />I think it is better using cooked leftover chicken.  It is not salty at all.<br />Makes an easy lunch if you used cooked chicken.
"I purchased a variety of the soup flavors and I do like them all a lot. However, I am finding I have to either pre-soak the vegetables and beans  an hour or more, or cook them a half hour longer in order for them to be done. If they are not completely done, there is stomach upset. The veggies are so very dry they require a lot more cooking than the directions suggest. Otherwise, the flavors are great and the soups are hardy and filling.... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NGAT60"">Frontier Soups Homemade In Minutes South Of The Border Tortilla Soup, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>"
Not as good as the Tortilla soup -- which tastes more like homemade -- the chicken was  more packaged tasting
"very small, much smaller than i expected and i measured it, it either is wrong or dimensions were wrong.Would not recommend at all."
"I ordered this product based on a sample a friend of mine sent me from Hawaii.  It arrived as scheduled and was as fresh as the sample I had tried.  Kona Coffee is certainly smooth with a nutty, almost chocolaty taste compared with other coffees I have tried.  I wonderful product that I will continue to order!"
"I'm not a huge coffee drinker but have tried quite a few brands. This has a very unique flavor, kind of earthy, semi bold, very full flavor. There's nothing I can compare it to but I'm not disappointed in any way. Would probably buy it again"
"My sister found out about smoked paprika thanks to ""Big Daddy's House"" on the Food Network.  I use it constantly and find it as great a staple as garlic in cooking.  Smoked paprika indeed adds a beautiful smoked flavor to foods without the barbeque grill.<br /><br />Purchasing the small jars from the supermarket was getting too costly.  By purchasing the 1 lb. size, I have been able to refill my little supermarket spice jar at least four times with plenty over.  I am grateful to Wholespice not only for offering the paprika in bulk for an extremely reasonable price, but for their fast shipping.<br /><br />If you've never tried smoked paprika, please give it a try.  If you enjoy using it as much as I do, please buy it from Wholespice.  I truly believe that you won't be disappointed."
"I could not find the mix for the Chappli Kabab here on amazon.com, so I wrote my review for this instead.  I live in a remote area of the wild west Rocky Mountains where Indian or Pakistani cuisine is completely non-existent in the form of a restaurant.  Purchasing a cookbook online, even our grocery stores don't sell the spices needed to create such dishes.<br /><br />I met a Pakistani woman on a flight from LA who introduced me to these Shan mixes.  She said they are very authentic, spicy.  All you need to add is the meat/vegies.  The instructions are printed in English on the back of the box and are easy to follow.  She sent me some and I tried them.  They are delicious.  And yes, SPICY!!!!  I was afraid to use the whole packet of spice for my chappli kabab, so I used 2/3's of it.  Even that much was alomst too spicy.  The flavor was magnificent."
This is a tiny little box of tiny tasteless Palmiers.  They are not sweet at all. I am so disappointed.
"I had been trying to remember the name of the these cookies for years so I could look for them. When i finally did and ordered this box, I was not disappointed at all. They're delicious! Even after having my wisdom teeth removed, I was still trying to eat them with sore gums. I just wish the box was bigger."
"I bought Pure Pantry's Old-Fashioned Pancake Mix at a local Farmer's market while I was looking for some healthier alternatives for my family.  There are not a lot of foods my 4-year-old likes or is willing to try.  He does love pancakes, so I thought if I could at least get his breakfast to be more healthy that would be a start.  I made the pancakes (not thinking he would like them - yes he's THAT picky) and he loved them.  Now he requests these over his old favorite.  My entire family loved them.  They have a great taste and fluffiness.  I highly recommend this product!"
"I bought the first bag at my local healthfood store. Since then I'm a repeat customer because I use this mix to create tasty and healthy dishes- sweet and savory. At first I made the pancake recipe on the bag. My family loved them. I experimented with my own ingredients together with some of the mix.  Whatever I made was a big hit!  Even 'though we don't need to eat gluten free, I know how healthy and delicious the reult will be when I cook with the pancake and baking mix."
"OMG!! It was the most delicious spread I have ever eaten!  I like that it is organic too. Palm oil in the other brand is not heart healthy in the long run. Nocciolata wins my love it vote!!  I like to eat it out of the jar with a spoon or mix it with peanut butter in a sandwich, awesome!! :-) I recommend this product over the popular supermarket brand.  It's really worth it!!!"
"We have 5 dogs and they absolutely love Nylabone Nutri Dent Filet Mignon. Indeed, in confirmation of ""Pavlov's Dog"" theory, they have even got the approximate time down for when they are to receive it, since they begin salivating and barking at me."
"My bichon poodle mix is very, very picky about treats.  He is the only dog I know that will walk away or spit out treats.  But these Filet Mignon Dog Chews he LOVES. I am ordering another bag!"
"We have two bachon's Frise Dogs who just love these. They only get one a day due to cost, otherwise they would eat the whole bag. Originaly we got these at Costco, however they do not carry them anymore."
These are great. Not to hard not too soft. My dogs love them.<br />They smell really good too. Wish they were bi<br />gger though.
Works to keep your dogs teeth clean and add much needed stuff to his diet. I am pleased with<br />the good prices and delivery.
This is the only bone my dog will eat.  Yes she is spoiled but I never knew I could only get one certain kind of bone.  So my dog is the poster dog for Nutri Dent dog chews.  I just hope they never discontinue them.  Great product and I am glad to find a bone chew my dog likes.
This is nearly the only treat that does not make my 8 month puppy sick.  Although a good value when purchased on Amazon they are still a bit expensive.  Since I don't brush my dog's teeth they are worth the money.
My cavalier king charles spaniel LOVES these. She's 3 months old and can have them gone in 15 minutes. Seem to digest well also
My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows. Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs. Greenies. The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage. slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices.
My dog loves these chews. He asks for them every night. Much cheaper to buy them here than try to find them in stores.
"This product is wonderful.  My older Westie has always had some trouble with plaque build-up and this product really took care of it.  On top of that, both of the dogs love the flavor, its like a treat to them.  And since I don't have to clean their teeth as often, it is a treat for me as well."
"Tried the angus beef flavored nutrident bones which dogs like just fine.  I may switch between the beef and green ones as one dog seems to like the green ones better.  All-in-all, highly recommended!!!"
"My little Chi-hua-hua is very picky and she just loves these.  I like them because they provide her some much needed fiber and vitamins and minerals, plus they help keep her teeth clean."
"My dogs like these the best and I'm glad if it cleans their teeth.  I bought a 32-count for what I felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more, hopefully for the same price.  I have two VERY picky eaters of food and treats, a toy and a miniature poodle.  They turn down practically all treats offered them.  These are their favorite (except for the gourmet duck treats from Costco that I can't find anywhere else).  These are really worth buying."
"My dogs loved these treats, but they are little expensive for no more than they give you."
My 2 MinPins love these chews. They each get one of the small size every morning after their walk and will drive me nuts until they get them. Their teeth are very clean and their breath doesn't smell either. I buy them by the case from Value Pet Supplies. Really nice people to do business with.
my dogs love the taste of these and they do help somewhat with keeping their teeth clean. This vendor has the best price. Much less than Petco.
My 3 maltese love these.  The product is great. J&B are a wonderful company to work with.  Thanks!
"I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy. However, they have a super strong odor, and I do not find them to be as appealing as he does. Recommended for dog's happiness, just hold your nose if you're sensitive to strong, funky, meat-like smells."
"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them."
"My maltipoo goes craaaazyyyy whith these treats! she doenst eat a lot, but she'll beg for these! Her teeth are very clean too! Ive purchased these treat 3 times now and I will keep purchasing them!"
"My Yorkie had very bad breath and since I have been giving him one of these every morning, his breath has improved so much that I don't mind his kisses on my face anymore."
"While I don't particularly like the name Nylabone since it makes me think I am giving my little guy nylon as a treat, he could care less!! Bugsy, my mini poodle rescue dog, loves Nylabone and therefore so do I."
"My dog is just addict, he love it. I cant stop buying it, even if I wanted to. It keeps his teeth clean and the veterinarian is happy with it."
"I have a VERY picky 9.5 yr old German Shepherd that leaves anything but a milkbone on the floor to collect dust.  She LOVED this bone!!!  I was amazed to see her crunch it up the large bone so quickly!  She's always been very well disciplined until these bones arrived at least.  She went into my pantry and tore the bag open and ate 7 bones!!!  She had such a low hung head when I approached her about the issue all I could do was laugh!!!  Luckily, my 4 month old shephard got one before her sister ate the batch!)  I save about $5 ordering the bones on Amazon."
"The medium size may be a little small for my wheaten but he likes them. They're US made and gluten free which supposedly is important for some breeds. Can't really attest to any teeth cleaning abilities as of yet, but he eats them happily."
i bought these for the fist  time at Petco and they were brown and clean looking.<br />I ordered the 125 count pantry pack nylabone filet mignon flavored minis and they had green and black spots and were very hard.<br />Trying to return them = they look disgusting compared to the pack that I bought at Costco.
"I first purchased a pack of Nutri Dent puppy chews for my Welsh Terrier when he was just a few months old. He LOVED them and they kept him busy for a while. Around the same time, he started itching and chewing on his paws incessantly and would not stop, even for a treat. Initially we thought it was the flee protection, then the shampoo, then the treats, then the peanut butter and lastly these. We continually phased each of the previous items out of his diet/lifestyle until finally we determined that the itching and scratching was related to these. We've obviously stopped giving these to him and now he rarely scratches or chews on himself. Your dog may have a different reaction to them but if he's experienceing any of the above symptoms, it may be related to these."
We first tired this mustard in Las Vegas.  It was served with fries and chicken and mixed with an equal part of mayo.  My son loves it and so do I
"Between my third and fourth year of medical school, I did a four week elective at Bastyr University, an accredited university for CAM (complementary and alternative medicine).  I did this for my personal curiosity, it is something I want to understand better and learn about.  But there are also practical reasons for an MD to study CAM.  Whether they admit it or not, our patients are use alternative medicines in conjunction with, or instead of, physician prescribed medications.  It makes sense for doctors to know at least the basics of what is out there and what people are doing, so our patients can comfortably discuss these things with us.<br /><br />During a lecture on herbal medicine (with the 'H' pronounced very deliberately), the herbal practitioner discussed what was known of the biochemistry of Valerian root.  Apparently it acts on the GABA receptor in a manner very similar to way benzodiazepines act (like valium, xanax, ativan, klonopin...).  So when they recommend Valerian root for its sleep promoting and/or anti-anxiety effects, it probably really is an effective treatment.  But then it seems to me it is probably also not a completely benign medication (we know the benzos aren't).  I asked the instructor if people could become tolerant or dependent on Valerian root, or if it could interact with other medications the way benzos can.  She smiled politely, doing her charitable best to conceal her contempt for my ignorance and the attitudes she presumed were behind my question.  After a beat, she answered ""no.""  ""You see, this is how plant spirits differ from pharmaceuticals.  The plant spirits only go where they are needed.""<br /><br />I'm not sure if I flinched or if I successfully suppressed my knee-jerk spasm of skepticism.  But this is where the CAM stuff gets away from me.  I want to have an open mind.  I certainly believe there is wisdom and alternates ways of healing out there outside of western medicine.  But I had a hard time swallowing it when CAM practitioners want it both ways.  They use the hard sciences any time it supports the use of alternative medications, but the second the hard science conflicts with their beliefs, they fall back on mystical explanations.  I'm not saying there's nothing to that, but let's just say it's not something I can wrap my mind around.<br /><br />In general, I think the herbal medicines are probably effective and safe when used very moderately.  Just as you can't get in too much trouble chewing cocaine leaves (versus snorting refined cocaine), you probably won't run into troubles with an herbal tea made with Valerian (versus potent doses of benzos).<br /><br />I think a lot of physicians have no problem with people using alternative medications except for a concern about the unknown.  An MD is not trained to convert units of herbal supplements into standard benzo doses, for example, so it introduces confounders.<br /><br />I'm not down on the herbal meds but I do believe that, when they work, they work for the same reasons pharmaceuticals work:  They have active ingredients causing real physiological effects.  And a placebo effect factors in, but we all know by now that our prescription drugs are benefit from placebo effects, so that's a wash.  So know what you are taking, how much is considered safe, and talk to your doctors about it.  Don't fool yourself into believing that herbal medications are harmless because they are ""natural.""  If your doctor is condescending and automatically dismissive, get a new doc.<br /><br />Ultimately, the course challenged me to more precisely define what an open mind is.  I have an open mind, in that I'm curious, I'm open to learning, I don't believe I know everything, and I'm willing to listen to other perspectives.  But an open-mind is not a blank mind.  I have my experiences, biases, and education kicking around up there.  My open mind does not have to believe everything it hears.  I can have an open mind and still maintain a critical stance.<br /><br />By the way, I'm giving thumbs up to this product.  It's a nice tea, nice relaxing bedtime treat with just a bit of honey.  If you need it for insomnia of muscle spasms, just make sure you talk to your doctor about the udnerlying problems and mention any supplements or herbal meds you use.  Thank you for listening."
"I wasn't familiar with this company before buying their Valerian Mint tea bags, but I can say the purchase was well worth the money.<br /><br />The bags included are not the smaller ones normally used for single serving tea cups. They are large enough to brew up to 2-3 cups and ideal for smaller tea pots. Right there the price becomes reasonable.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is fairly agreeable, too; Peppermint is never a bad way to go when flavoring medicinal/therapeutical herbs. I usually drop in an extra bag of chamomile when steeping Valerian, so that helps with the flavor, too.<br /><br />Personally speaking, I feel the effects of Valerian tea much faster than, say, capsules of Valerian root one might buy at a natural foods store. I can recommend this as a soothing alternative to whatever you might normally drink to relax at the end of the day.<br /><br />If I had to list any specific concern, it would be the intensely vivid dreams that Valerian seems to produce from time to time, but nothing so mind-bending that I would stop drinking the tea.<br /><br />Lastly, avoid heavy or daily usage, beacuse the build-up in your system can lead to problems. You don't wanna be that health-obsessed guy In Newport Beach who died from a massive build-up of Echinacea in his system. Give your body time to flush the herbs out. They aren't always water soluable like Vitamin-B."
This tea is nice to relax with at night. The smell of Valerian tea is very strong but the mint version has much more of a pleasent odor. One thing I did find out is that my cat seemed to go crazy for the smell and the bag. It turns out that Valerian tea is almost like catnip for a cat and dogs like it too.
"This product does provide a good night's sleep. I did not wake up feeling ""groggy"". However, the odor is strong. I stored it in a plastic bag or container, separate from other items, to mask the odor. Overall, I will use this product again."
"I've had this tea before, and it does the trick.  Tastes nasty, but gets you sleepy. Unfortunately, this past order from, Nutricity, never showed up.  I wrote to them and their response was inadequate. I wrote again, and they ignored me.  Luckily, Amazon gave me a refund."
"My wife has been eating rice cakes daily for the past 16 to 18 months.  The Lundberg Eco-Farmed Sesame Tamari Rice Cakes are her favorite rice cakes.  She tried the flax seed rice cakes by this same company and liked them too, but not nearly as well as the Tamari.  She asked me to tell you that they are very delicious.  Me? Well, I eat peanuts."
"The Sesame Tamari is my favorite flavor rice cake.  My kids will eat these up, too, and one of them is a picky eater.  I personally keep a bag of these in my desk drawer at work for those late afternoon hungries and these fill me up and take care of my hunger pangs.  Plus, these rice cakes are exceptionally good for you, but you know that since you are looking at Lundberg offerings."
"These cakes do not taste fresh and have little flavor. The tamari is far too slight and the sesame is not noticeable at all. The effect is a bland flavor.<br /><br />The texture is chewy, not crisp as one would want in a rice cake.<br /><br />Overall, a disappointing product."
"We tried De Cecco pasta via subscribe and save, and it is simply not as good as this pasta. Where De Cecco becomes water logged and turns to mush before it is al dente, DaVinci maintains a nice slick & delicious body. The only better pasta is Barilla, but it isn't available via subscribe and save."
"I bought this for the first time and made spaghetti with it.  The pasta is very gummy which is kind of nasty.  I have cooked a lot of spaghetti over the years and this brand is the only one that has cooked up that way. (I did try two of their pasta spaghetti products)<br />I have cooked up angel-hair pasta(other brands) for too long until it was soft as heck or not cooked it enough, so they are firm and could use a little more cooking. BUT the pasta is never gummy tasting.<br /><br />I can't recommend the brand."
"At $38 a pound it should be good and, believe me, it is.  My wife and I enjoy Serrano ham in Spain and this is spot on.  It is hard not to sneak to the frig and retrieve a quick tapa.  I highly recommend this product.  It is wonderful by itself or with scrambled eggs.  La Tienda is a top notch supplier."
"The look of the ham was somewhat dissapointing.  Having eaten Jamon Serrano throughout latin America and Spain... I was not blown away like I was hoping,,, it was OK but only OK."
"I became addicted to spanish ham while I was pregnant... spending $10 per plate for a 1oz portion on top of some salad greens at a local restaurant... I ordered this ham because it was the best price per ounce that I could find, and was not disappointed!<br /><br />This ham has a very rich flavor, causing me to eat it very slowly and enjoy it for longer. A half of a slice would satisfy my craving, and it seemed to never run out!<br /><br />Tastes great paired with fruit such as pears or sweet apples.. It cleanses your pallet to allow your next bite of ham to be as delicious as the first!<br /><br />I've since had my baby, but am ordering another pack of this ham because it's so good! My husband loves it as well."
"This was such a good deal that I figured I'd take a chance on this much product. It shipped without a problem (which I was a little nervous about since it's a LOT of food in a plastic container) and you get over 12 pounds of Korean style fermented soybean paste (this has little chunks of fermented soybeans and is not smooth all the way through like miso).<br /><br />The expiration dates on mine were well over a year (and will last much longer if kept in cold storage both before and after opening).<br /><br />The ingredients as stated on the package are:<br />Soybeans, water, salt<br /><br />I'm going to enjoy making soups, stir-fries and salads with this delicious soybean paste!<br /><br />A+++"
"Great taste, great consistancy, my wife is Korean and this is a big product in the Republic.<br /><br />Not so hot, but not too mild just right. thank you for providing such outstanding product."
"There are huge boxes so if you're just cooking for yourself or a small family, beware.  They are about 6x bigger than the ones you'd see in an Asian grocery store (the small boxes with the same brand and packaging).  Flavor is alright but quite salty.  I bought this to make Ja Jiang Mian (the Chinese kind, not the Korean) because I couldn't find the black bean paste in my local stores.  These are yellow beans.  Fail on my part..."
I searched all the local health food stores for this product but they had no idea what it was. I was happy ( lucky!) to find it with the mill. The mill makes it easier to season with this product and spreads the maple flavor more evenly than the flakes alone. The cap allows you to measure the quantity once ground so it is easier to use in recipes.  It is refillable so I also ordered the 4 oz flakes separately.
"The maple flakes were just what I thought they would be, they had great maple flavor for just a little bit and calories are not bad. I recomend using after cooking for best flavor. I added it to oatmeal while cooking and it wasn't enough so I added some extract. The next time I made it I added a sprinkle atop when in my bowl. Much better. I have also added it to vanilla yogurt, cinnamon toast, and cut apple slices for the kids. I love it. Shipped very fast too."
"I really liked the Bigelow Vanilla Almond tea, but they have discontinued it. Sadly, this brand is not as good as the tea I miss. The tea bags are nice, but the flavor is not very strong. It tastes more like black tea with a hint of vanilla and almond. I'll keep looking..."
"These are very tasty, and you can find these udon noodles at most stores. I really like the flavoring and this is my favorite flavor."
"It says organic , but even compared to the regular , (which all my cats have always preferred) this stuff brings out the beast like it's laced with PCB . Not always available , try some and you'll find yourself rationing it for special occasions ."
"Kitty drove me crazy trying to get to the cat nip inside the container, but once I put some out for her, she seemed to have no interest in it. Even the other four cats just took a simple sniff and left it."
"I couldn't resist writing a review about catnip. My cats really love the stuff and are starting to try to open the package themselves. I don't know what else to say, but if you like to watch your cats roll around on the floor give this a try!!!"
"I had never tried marzipan, but had always wanted to.  While shopping on Amazon, this caught my eye, so decided to try it.  I hope this is not what marzipan is supposed to taste like.  I can taste the almonds, but have to get past the old, stale smell and taste first.  If marzipan has a ""best if used by"" date, the one I had was WAY past that date."
"Great marzipan. Similar to the ones you can get in the store, however, I live in an area where going to that type of a store in unfeasible. They were a great price and came quickly. I will be reordering!"
I really love marzipan and this product is excellent.  It has great taste and looks as good as it taste.
"I have purchased marzipan from this company several times before and was always extremely satisfied.  The main complaint that I had up to my last purchase was that they did not always have it in stock, and the wait was sometimes quite long. The price is very high also, but for excellent marzipan, it would be worth the price.  Unfortunately, this was not excellent marzipan.  Although, the previous marzipan I received from them was very good, the last box that I purchased was not at all tasty.  In fact, it had almost no almond taste, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan.  Let's hope they go back to their old recipe!"
"Bought these as a wedding favor for my wedding, and they were great. Ordered a few boxes and they were fresh and came fast! Thanks Jelly Belly!"
"I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have ""surprise jelly beans"" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated."
"I grew up in Cincinnati, OH and have always loved these chips.  I live in Pittsburgh now, and they are not available here.  They sell these in large boxes (about a pound of chips) and it is one of my favorite christmas gifts each year when my family gets these for me.  Hands down the absolute best bbq chips ever.  People I work with always ask me when I am going to Cinci to get some more!!"
"I live in and am originally from NJ where Grippos aren't available, I was first introduced to them while living in OH for a few years, and I must say, Grippos bbq potato chips are THE BEST chips I have ever tasted. I like Lays, and all of the other popular chips, but they have nothing on these. When friends would come visit me from OH, I would ask them to bring me a few bags, now that I know I can order them online, I try my best to keep my pantry stocked."
"I love Grippos, they're great!  I would go crazy if they weren't sold here.  But, you're wrong thy're not only sold in Ohio; they're sold here in Kentucky as well.  And I am so glad that they are!"
This was bought as a Christmas gift for some out of town friends. It arrived quickly and intact. Very easy transaction.
I purchased these chips and I can't stop eating them. I am overseas and I have to have a bag in my cabinet.<br /><br />UM UM Good!
"I LOVE Grippos!! I've ordered this product twice, and it was prompt service and I have no complaints...except the price. This is the best potato chip in the world in my opinion...yet I PAY A HIGH PRICE to have the luxury to eat them, and in todays economy..not going to happen often."
"This is the best spread that I have ever topped toast with. It's a product of England imported for CA, and the family company that produces it has been around since 1881. Premium quality all around; enjoy."
"Our first introduction to this product was at a hotel, where they included it as an option with oatmeal. We loved the crunchiness and taste, and occasionally used them for on the road snacks. The individual packaging ensured that the nuts kept fresh, and we enjoyed the blend."
"I fell in love with Coco's curry while my husband was stationed over in Japan. House Foods is actually the company that owns Coco's, so when I found this I had to buy it. I've found that if you add a little s&b curry powder to this, it tastes almost like fresh Coco's curry. Add a little cayenne pepper and you get the heat of it too. Long story short, if you love Coco's or are looking for a good Japanese curry, this is definitely worth the buy."
"I've been looking for a prepared Japanese curry product that had the same taste as the beef curry they used to serve at my favorite Ramen shop, before they stopped selling it (I guess I was the only one who would order it).  This is about as close as I've found to it, and it's incredibly easy to make.  Makes a great quick lunch out of the microwave with some rice, or you can add in some cooked meat (great use of leftovers!) and make a full meal of it.  They also say that you can put it over spaghetti or some other cooked pasta, but that's just a little too strange for me to try.<br /><br />This also works extremely well for camping since it's boil-in-bag and hermetically sealed, or could just be something to keep in the pantry for the long term.  It says ""HOT"" but if you've ever tried other types of Japanese-style curry, the scale of mild to hot is incredibly weak, with mild flavors coming closer to a sort of gravy and hot flavors not even reaching the level of the blandest Indian curry.  House Hot curry is very heavy on the apple and is rather sweet, but there's certainly enough spice to make it tastier than the milder flavors and there are a surprisingly large number of veggies for such a small pouch.  I'll definitely be ordering another batch once I've gone through the current one."
"I've been eating this stuff for years--it was super simple to prepare as a college student (and has a long shelf life).  Now as a mother, my 3-year-old son loves it, and he's usually picky (note that my son only eats the ""mild"" version of this sauce).  I mix it with steamed white rice or steamed quinoa.  Both ways are fab, but of course it's healthier with quinoa.  It's cheaper at the local Asian market--but if you don't have those nearby, I guess this is the next best place to stock up."
"My wife and I use this on rice or noodles when we're pressed for time and need to make a quick lunch or dinner. It's quite easy to use, particularly if you have a microwave -- simply put the contents over rice and microwave the whole bowl for about a minute, and it's all heated and ready to go (it's precooked). The taste is pretty good, without being too spicy (it's actually quite mild). That said, the taste does have a little MSG in it, which isn't ideal for us. We would recommend getting this for quick meals, but wouldn't make it a regular household food."
"For those that like Japanese curry, this is a very pleasant one. It's very reasonably priced, and the taste is great. It's super convenient to just throw in some boiling water to heat, or put on top of rice or other vegetables and microwave. If you like more peas or carrots in your curry, just throw in some frozen ones before you microwave. Very satisfying."
"This curry sauce is classic Japanese-style curry. There are a few veggie chunks mixed in, enough to make you feel a bit less guilty about consuming it. The hot flavor appears at first to be not all that hot, but has a nice spicy kick at the end. The perfect addition to any rice and meat dish. So far I've pared it with hamburgers and chicken with great success.<br /><br />Perfect for when you're in the mood for an averagely spicy curry."
"I just wanna say first off, this is the only other Japanese Curry Ive had since I went to CoCo ichibanya in Tokyo. I actually used a MRE heater to warm up the pouch, which worked great. I then poured it on some rice and had a great meal. The portions are single serving size, but enough. The taste was great and vegetables were flavorful. The only thing I would say its not terribly hot, but its just right."
This coffee makes getting up at 5 a.m. worth it. Drinking it is like giving yourself a gift. We love it!
"This tea is absolutely remarkable.  I ordered a cup of this on a whim while working on application essays for grad school.  I figured (especially being caffeine free) that it would just be a gimic and that I'd just move onto a latte afterward.  Well...I never needed the latte.  This woke me up and made me focus better than anything I have ever tried before.  Now instead of taking my ADHD meds, which work but give me migraines, I usually just grab a cup of this instead.  I'm about to finish up my first can and will definitely be purchasing another one.  Whether looking for energy, focus, or both, this tea absolutely delivers!  I cannot recommend it enough.<br />***Word of caution***  One cup is plenty to get you going; a little goes a LONG way.  Two cups in a row made me a little jittery, dizzy, and gave me stomach pain."
"I'm a die-hard coffee drinker, but I love this tea!<br /><br />I found it a few years ago, when I was trying to kick my coffee habit. Republic of Tea offers so many varia-teas, (pardon the pun!) it's impossible to pick a favorite. This one is just right for the 3pm pick-me-up or day's end. It's flavorful and refreshing, without ""the coffee effect."" (Rooibos tea is caffeine free.) Definitely my favorite of Republic's red wellness line. Even better with a little honey added, to enhance the tea's natural sweetness."
"I was looking for the tea ingredients that I saw on the Dr Oz show for rejuvenating in the afternoon. I get tired by 2pm everyday whether I am working or taking care of my toddler. I used to drink caffeine tea to give me a boost, but I trying to eat and drink healthier. This tea works great and I don't get a crash. It also tastes good ( a bit like Lipton's Mandarin)"
"I'm a huge fan of Republic of Tea teas, but this one was way too much.  The smell of the tea brings me back to how the house used to smell when my grandpa smoked pipes. Its not a bad smell like cigarettes, but it also isn't the type of smell you want to drink either. I asked some coworkers to smell it too, and they all mentioned old men or smoking. They also would not drink a cup when I offered!<br /><br />Luckily, when the tea is brewed, it doesn't taste as strong as it smells, but there is a lot of Roobios in there and I guess I'm not a huge fan of that either.  I've only been able to get through two cups of this tea and I did feel a little 'charged' afterward - the stuff is strong - but I think you've got to be a fan of really bold, tobacco-like flavors to get into this tea."
"Hated Tea my whole life, UNTIL I FOUND (REPUBLIC OF TEA) I have about 15 flavors and I love them all, still trying new ones to see if I can find one I don't like. Got my kids, wife, dad, friends, loving it too!!!<br />All 5 Stars, good price, good packaging, good product and got here FAST!!"
this tea did absolutely nothing to boost my energy. And it has a fake sugary think happening too. the tea is literally sticky. NO ENERGY.<br />STICKY.<br /><br />i don't know- if you like tangy sugary red teas you would enjoy this but it would have nothing to do with boosting energy
"We adopted a sweet dog from a local animal rescue. His underbelly was red, inflamed looking, and he was constantly scratching. His vet history included chronic/repeated ear infections.  Considering the high cost of vet bills, and our desire to give this sweet dog a good life, I spent a few hours reading online about chronic canine ear infections & skin disorders.<br /><br />I did not realize that so many brands of pet food had corn and other grain type products included (and often the primary ingredient).  Most people don't have corn or wheat as their primary food source, so I find it odd that pet food would have.......<br /><br />From what I read on several sites, allergies to those ingredients can cause skin issues and chronic ear problems.<br /><br />After a couple of expensive vet visits, 2 months on expensive Advantix flea treatment, 6 weeks of ear antibiotics (twice daily administration) and a month of oral antibiotics, I decided to switch to a different food.<br /><br />Within 3 days, our dog's underbelly skin became a normal, skin color. The ear infection cleared in about two weeks (confirmed by vet visit & ear swab labwork). The constant scratching went away.  He is like a different dog now, and I attribute a large part of that to his feeling better and having more energy since he's not scratching or having hurting ears.<br /><br />The cost of this dog food is WELL worth it to me, and my rescue pet.  Having less vet care alone will easily cover the cost of this food.  We have tried the other flavors, and he enjoys them as well."
"This is THE best dog food ever. My dog will eat this up like she's eating a juicy steak! I stumbled upon this product at Petco and wanted to get dog food that did not animal test their product. Halo was one of them and so I picked up a bag. Salmon was a very unique flavor, unlike everyone's ubiquitous lamb and rice. This food is very similar to giving your dog Greenies. I swear, it's like feeding them crack.<br /><br />My dog now looks forward to breakfast and dinner (her two feeding times). No more do we just leave our food out there because Spot will eat it up immediately!<br /><br />All in all:<br /><br />* My dog LOVES this dog food.<br />* Not tested on animals, like Iams does."
"I have a very picky 90lb German Shepard. He snubs his nose at food that he gets tired of, which is often. We have to resort to hand feeding him or buying another brand of food when he goes days without eating. Yes, he has trained us! However, Halo has changed our dogs eating habits. He no longer misses meals and never gets bord of his food. This is the 4th or 5th bag we have given him, (between the chicken and salmon) and he's never needed to switch brands. This is the longest run we have gone with his food. He loves it!"
"We switched to the Halo dog food when my dog started having an allergic reaction to her previous, grocery store bought food.  After we switched, her reaction stopped, so I feel good about paying a little extra for this brand.  I love the product, and the fact that I can have a 30 lb bag shipped to my door in New York City (with FREE shipping if you're on Amazon Prime!) is worth buying it online.<br /><br />In the past, we'd given her the chicken flavored, but since she loves salmon table scraps when we have it for dinner, I thought I'd try this flavor.  She, of course, loves it.  After she finishes, she'll usually stare at her dish and bark for more (that's how it works, right?)  I would say this is a little smellier than the chicken flavor - and leaves her muzzle kind of salmon stinky.  Also, I usually have to wash my hands after feeding her to get the smell off.<br /><br />Overall, I'll probably buy again (and this same flavor) just because she likes it so much.  That said, be prepared for it to be a little smellier than your normal food."
"No byproducts, or any type of 'meal'.  No corn or wheat.  Not tested on animals.  My dogs love it.  Worth the $$."
"I switched my 3 year old large breed mixed dog from Timberwolf Organics Southwest Chicken and homemade dog food to the Halo Wild Salmon about a month ago.  He appears to like it.  His energy level hasn't declined and he isn't starving at the end of the day because of fillers.  It smells good and has a great recipe line up.  Its neither over priced nor a ""great deal"" but it's prime eligible so you save on the shiping.  It is worth the price it is sold for and performs as promised."
When my beloved chihuahua passed away from kidney disease I was convinced it was from bad stuff in dog food. After much research I found Halo food. Our 4 dogs love it and I even noticed a healthier coat on one of my dogs!
Amended amendment: Now it's back and shipped by amazon ... I cannot keep up with the changes!!<br /><br />Amended review: BEWARE!!! The product has gone up in price from $59.99 to 72.99 because Amazon no longer sells it directly and you get shuffled off to other sellers. Can not use Prime for free shipping either. Guess I'm going to have to find a local store now ... if one can be found. I find this quite unfair of Amazon to drop a product without notification to its customers. I dropped its rating to reflect the poor policy decision not the quality of the product.<br /><br />The most important consideration is answered in the title. It is a premium food with all healthy ingredients and comes packaged in a heavy (thick) plastic bag rather than in paper. Maddie likes it; what more can I want in a dog food that is good for her health and well-being.
"I love Decaf Cafe Verona, especially in whole bean.  It's definitely one of my favorite roasts.  It's a nice dark roast, but sweet and cocoa-ey.  I like this roast with dessert or in the evening.  The beans are nice and oily and fresh every time.  I highly recommend this roast!"
"Whole bean Decaf Verona is a strong decaf that I blend 50/50 with either Italian or French Roast whole beans (usually French).  This blend makes a robust, richly flavored cup of coffee."
"Out of the four blends of Starbucks coffee I have purchased and tried, this is by far the worst. Super bitter with a complementary disgusting after taste."
"Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare! Just add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. You can use your bread machine if you put it on the ""Quick Bake"" cycle.  It comes out of the pan easily and intact with a crusty exterior/moist interior, and maybe just a hint of sweetness.  As for the jalapenos, we don't find them to be hot, but they do add a little zest.  We usually enjoy this with a nice hot soup on a cold day."
"Hodgson Products are excellent, not because I maybe family(Hodshon}, but their mill products are of the highest quality. Cornbread with a kick and substance. Thank you Hodgson Mill & amazon.com."
it was a gift to someone for his birthday and he loved it. got there quickly and goes with many meals or good just for a snack
"It's a big hit at my house. We even tried it with about 1/2 to 1 cup of whole kernel corn poured into the mix just before putting in oven. Very good. Has a bit of a kick, but not hot at all. Slight jalapeno flavor-doesn't overwhelm the great taste of yellow cornmeal. We've added a seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper to the mix-very tasty. Great with a bean soup or your favorite chili recipe. My son could just eat it by itself for a meal. This has become one of our favorites from Amazon. Very pretty color that looks very nice on the table and after cutting, btw. If you like cornbread, this mix is hard to beat."
"I can't stop munching on this cornbread.  While the jalapeno could be more pronounced, it is present.  The texture is crisp, moist and soft all at the same time.  I love it!  Bakes up perfectly if you follow the package directions."
"I love Hodgson's bread mixes for the bread machine and keep almost every flavor on Subscribe and Save so I'm never without. When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it. The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent, the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy. Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread, even those made gluten free or wheat based. This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil. The second try I used butter, but achieved the same results. Because I figured it was Hodgson's and it would be great, I ordered a case of 6 boxes. Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen. I just did not like the flavor, texture, appearance or indescribable after-taste. I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it."
"We loved the Hodgson Mill 9 grain and honey wheat breads but I hope I just got a bad box in the case of the Jalapeno Cornbread I ordered.  There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap.  No Jalapeno flavor.  I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked.  I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake."
"Amazon actually shipped this to Afghanistan, which made we very happy. I had tried a similar product before in the states and I wanted to try it again here. This product is a winner and a hit with the guys here at this base!"
THANK YOU HODGSON MILL for a wonderful product! Did my New Year's Blackeye Peas & Fried Chicken today and very pleased with my first experience with the Mexican Style Jalapeno Cornbread Mix. This will be a regular at our table as Amazon's price for Subscribe & Save Program is good not to say anything about Amazon mails it to me..who wouldn't like that?
"I agree with others who say that the jalapeno flavor is not as strong as I would have liked but that's not a big deal to me, I hit most things with hot sauce anyway. This mix was very easy to make (even though I was out of vegetable oil and used EVOO - probably had a little different taste therefor) and was quite tasty. I think I'll make muffins with it next time and I'll definitely use a light veg oil too.<br />Really, for a $1.80 per batch, hard to complain about this. And easy to like."
These are not hot even though they day Jalapeno. We cannot even taste any Jalapeno.  But they are soft & delicious.  Now they are our favorite cornbread.  To bad they are not Organic.
Great product for bread makers this bread taste great just like a bakery. Easy to follow directions.
can't beat the price for them and they are fairly helthy.  easy to make.
"Having lived in the deep South for eight years, I know cornbread. This stuff isn't sweet, has a slight bite due to the jalapeno, and is pretty tasty. You do need milk and an egg, and I was searching for box breads that only needed water ( single guy ), but it is worth the price."
"Love it!!I recieved this item in record time, and I love the quality of it!! Thank you"
"I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned."
"These jelly beans are my favorite. The problem was that little care was taken in packing. When the package arrived, I was so excited that I opened the package in the parking lot of my office. The inner packaging was broken and I wound up with nearly the full pound on the lot! Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!"
"This sausage seasoning indicates on the package that is is ""maple"" flavor. It was not what I expected. I wanted to find a seasoning without the nitrates used as a preservative that are serious health risk, so I am going to learn to make my own fresh sausage.<br /><br />I am accustomed to the flavor of maple syrup. This product is a disappointment. Either I do not know what maple taste like or the company producing this product does not know what maple taste like, for my taste this is as far from maple taste as possible.<br /><br />If I could rate this product as a zero I would. I will not buy products from this producer again and do not recommend."
"I love this coffee.  I look forward to my daily cup in the morning.  It has a wonderful flavor.  I have tried other brands, but, they seem to taste so artificial.  This one tastes real."
I bought it and I was happy to see big pieces real candy? But it is not big pieces of candy<br />it kind of mistake of read it. It is all small pieces of mini twist candies inside.<br />If it was real big pieces of candy then yes it is great deal to show it as it said the biggest<br />candy in world? No it is not?
"This bully stick that I had purchased was listed at 36"".  I had bought 15 of them and not one of them where that length. The ""mondo"" tiltle would not be accurate either, the sticks were very thin. I have a great dane and he went through the first stick I gave him in an hour.<br />I had purchased bully sticks from the web site valuepetsupplies.com that were also 36"", and the sticks were all that length or longer. The sticks were thick and the quality was far better than the Merrick. The company sells grass fed beef bullies and it is a family run business. It was also cheaper and FREE shipping as opposed to Amazon which was not. So, better elsewhere."
"Ordinarily, I love Thai food.  I love peanut sauce.  Recently, I moved to the country and was disappointed that I cannot find peanut sauce in my local stores.  So, I came to Amazon.  I really didn't want 6 jars of peanut sauce even though it was the type I usually use.  Instead, I bought this jar.<br /><br />The price is right.  You only have to buy one jar BUT since the taste isn't good, it isn't such a good bargain.<br /><br />The first sensation to hit your mouth is of a strange sweetness - somehow a little unpleasant.  There is a vague peanut-butter edge but not enough to drown out the sweetness.  After you manage to swallow, there is a surge of spiciness.  All-in-all, all I can see is ick."
"This sauce is incredible! I ordered both of the different sauces (peanut and satay) because of its all natural healthy ingredients. My boyfriend, (who happens to be thai) was hesitant to try it at first because he says he can never find a sauce that met his standards, UNTIL THIS!! One day I came home from work excited to have it over some fried tofu and vegetables, to find that HE HAD EATEN THE ENTIRE THING!! We are both truly loyal customers now - we absolutely love this sauce, it is great on salads, with meats, vegetables or tofu - it really adds an addictive flavor to any dish. Also, the shipping is fast and reliable, and I have found that the price is well worth-it compared to what else is out there (especially with the free shipping that is offered). If you want the real deal, you cannot beat Wan's sauce. I would recommend it to anyone."
"I finally have found a great peanut sauce that is healthy. I love peanut sauces from Thai cuisine, but I could not indulge in them daily. The ingredients are so much healthier than anything I could find in the markets or groceries. It seems most large companies add so many preservatives, salts and fat. This happens to also be free of any peanut allergens so its great to serve to guests without worrying who's allergic to peanuts. I am able to enjoy it more often now and even took some jars to a chain of bistros down town that like to dabble in exotic foods. They loved it too. I wish this was available in a health food store or some of the specialty groceries near by. This is absolutely the best tasting peanut sauce I have ever tasted. True to the Thai cuisine which I love."
"I have no issue with the product itself, my issue is with the incentive system that is being put into place via the subscribe and save option.  Listen, why is the smallest package the only option and by the way the cheapest per ounce?  That is ridiculous when you end up with so many teeny packages and save pretty big doing so compared to other 'bulk' options that use far less packaging.  Sends the wrong message if you asked me..."
"The Polar Kipper Snacks have great flavor. They aren't ""fishy"" and taste more like bacon than other kippers I've tried. So I often have them with scrambled eggs for a more healthy alternative to bacon.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information from the bottom of the tin:<br /><br />Serving Size 1/2 can (46g)<br />Servings per Container 2<br /><br />Amount Per Serving<br />Calories  100<br />Calories from Fat  60<br /><br />Total Fat  6g...........................................9% DV<br />  Saturated Fat  1g................................5% DV<br />  Trans Fat  0g<br />Cholesterol  30mg................................10% DV<br />Sodium  260 mg....................................10% DV<br />Total Carbohydrate  0g........................0% DV<br />  Dietary Fiber  0g..................................0% DV<br />  Sugars  0g<br />Protein 9g<br /><br />Provides 1.4g Omega-3 Fatty Acid Per Serving.<br /><br />Vitamin A  0% Daily Value (DV)<br />Vitamin C  0% DV<br />Calcium 1.5% DV<br />Iron  4% DV<br />*Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2000 calorie diet.<br /><br />Ingredients: All natural smoked boneless fillets of herring, water, salt.<br /><br />Kosher Parve<br /><br />Distributed by: MW Polar Foods<br />Norwalk, CA  90650<br />Product of Germany"
"These Polar kipper snacks are excellent. I have been buying these since the price of the Crown Prince snacks went up. These are just as good or better then the Crown Prince & are a lot cheaper. I have tried other brands of Kipper snacks, & the Polar snacks are as good or better than all of them.<br />D.Martinez<br />Dearborn Heights MI"
"I just ate my first serving of these kipper fillets.  They seem just right with light salt and just enough water, not too much.  Very nice indeed.  The best non-edible part of the deal is the can which opened easier than any other kipper can I have tried.  Oh, and the price per can is amazing.  Just yesterday I checked and the cheapest kippers at Krogers were 2.49 for just 3.25 oz."
"I've enjoyed kippered herring all my (long) life, and have tried all of the popular brands found on supermarket shelves, at least in my area.  Found these by accident and, boy, they're head and shoulders above the competition....well, herring don't have shoulders, but you know what I mean.  Kippered means smoked, and these have fine smoky flavor, are beautifully packed in nice wide tins.  There's no extra juice or excessive oil, just fine flavor, packed like soldiers, no empty space.  Savor them!!"
These are absolutely great Kippers. And at a great price. They are almost impossible to find in stores.
"These are so good! I bought them for my husband, thinking they would be chunks of fish, but no, *Happily* they are filets, great!!! My husband loves them, he frys them in a little butter and has them for breakfast along with a good peice of french bread and butter. We will be buying these again and again. Best part is that they do not have to be refrigerated and you can have them anytime you want."
"I bought the 18 pack for office snacks / small meals.  They are just right for this.  The nutrition information says ""two servings,"" but the total package, consisting of two filets, is 3.53 ounces, and if you are like me it will be ""one"" serving for you.  That will net you 200 calories (120 of this is from fat, including 2 grams of saturated fat but no trans fat), and 520 mg of sodium.  Not bad.  These are very tasty kippers, deliciously smoked.  They are packed in water, not oil, but the fish texture is good -- not soggy as I thought might be the case.  These fish are packed in Germany.  I think these are a great value and will help keep me away from the potato chip machine in the office."
"These kippers have a wonderful flavor and texture.  They are smokey with just enough salt.  I wish the cans were bigger.  You open the can and the fillets are solid and firm, which is surprising for not being in oil.  I think they taste a touch better than the John West brand without the oil.  If I had both in front of me I would have a problem picking between the two.  If you like smoked kippers this is the brand I would suggest.  I was a lifelong King Oscar fan until I tried these."
"Delicious lightly smoked herring at reasonable price, and best of all Herring are a sustainable resource, far enough down on the food chain that they don't concentrate toxins to the same degree as larger predator fish.  The firm fresh texture is as good as I've ever found in a canned fish."
"I once found this item at almost every grovery store. Now, I have to drive almost an hour to a very large grocery store. I can't seem to ever buy enough to get me through the next trip to the big city. I order them 3 cases at a time now, and make sure I re-order before I'm dowm to my last case. ( They come 18 cans per case ) I sure would hate to go through life without thiis little treat. Almost every night I think about having a treat. I don't, because they woud be gone too soon. If you like canned fish snacks, you will love these. One of lifes great pleasures.<br />Enjoy........but I know you will!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KHMWQS"">Polar Kipper Snacks, 3.53 Ounce Units (Pack of 18)</a>"
"I'll be honest. Originally, I was looking to buy a different brand name of Kipper Snacks, but it was not available at the time. So by purchasing the Polar Kippers instead, ended up being a better choice for me. In fact my Dad enjoys them as well! They have a great texture and natural smoked flavor that I enjoy eating with Saltine Crackers, or just right out of the can!. I will definitely continue buying these!~ :-)"
"These are wonderful, lightly salted in water instead of oil. Tastes a lot lighter packaged this way.<br />Great light smokey flavor. Great way to get Omega-3 from a sustainable source with an inexpensive price.<br />Just enough for a snack. I will be a regular purchaser."
"Wonderful as a breakfast with potatoes and/or kasha..1/2 tin makes me feel ok  until about 3 pm...stop fighting mother nature--eat your herring,sardines,pork,kippers and get on with American life....Incorporate Russian and American into your diet to adapt and thrive in this wonderful country of limitless possibilities...  feel wonderful at age 64..draw your own conclusions..cabbage,onions,garlic-get my message...stop starving yourselves!"
"Enough mystery about smoked herring has made the rounds, and it's time someone penetrated the veil and let in some light.<br /><br />This product is the definitive vanguard of Kippered Herring. It's the perfect expression of the art. Finely prepared, perfectly smoked, packed in a light oil and loaded with Omega-3, produced in Germany and clearly done with affection and a commitment to quality.<br /><br />I recommend MW Polar Kipper Snacks without reservation."
"Never bought kippers online, so that's the first attempt. I'm not disappointed: the box was delivered very fast, and the kippers are great, mildly smokey with a good texture. Btw, I was on the fence initially whether to buy this kind -- because of the negative reviews here. I usually value critical reviews highly (and leave them myself whenever due), but I gotta say that these negative reviewers here must be smoking something good. One says, fish is loosely packed, soft and slimey in a lot of water. This is a lie: sizeable chunks of fish are packed very tightly; the texture is very nice; and there is maybe a tablespoon of salt water in a tin. Another says there's gluten in it. Wha? How did this come about? Gluten? In fish? I searched the tin for any mention of gluten, and, as expected, found nothing. Yet another einstein found soy in it. Again, where did you get this garbage about soy? I couldn't see anything about soy. It's fish and salt water. These guys must have been high, OK, good for them, but why post reviews in this blessed condition?<br /><br />Bottom line: perfect. If you like kippers, you'll like this version (and also, it's cheaper than buying in stores: round here, a comparable tin of kipper will be about two bucks.) I will certainly buy more.<br /><br />Update: I figured the reason the negative reviewers complained about gluten and soy: they confused this product with the same brand kippers in mustard sauce: I just ordered a box and, according to the ingredients list on the tins, _that_ product does have everything they complain about (because of the sauce)."
"These Kipper Snacks are delicious.  First and foremost, the can is very easy to open.  Its shape and size makes Kipper an easy travel item, as with most other brands' cans, I suppose.  The scent of fish is strong, but typical of herring stored in this manner.  However, the smokey scent is not over powering and adds to the flavor: perfect.  As for the salt water, the amount of salt is light enough to complement the flavor of the fish, and not overwhelming, like other Kipper snack brands I will decline to mention.  The texture of the fish is good in that it is not too soggy, nor does it break up too easily, once removed from its solution.  To sum it up, these Kipper Snacks are a perfect blend of flavor.  No need to feel guilty here: Kippers also provide a healthy dose of omega 3 fatty acid, responsible for lowering triglycerides.  Enjoy!"
"Great kippers, great taste, right amount of salt. Although I do get to buy these I have found out from my local grocer for 1.19..  Still worth the buy!"
"I first started buying these at the local grocery store, where they retail for about $[...]  a tin.  For me, buying them in bulk on here is a good deal, because I go through a few tins per week.<br /><br />These are a great high-protein snack, relatively low in salt and high in Omega-3 acids.  Combine them with some good whole wheat crackers and a little spicy mustard and enjoy.  They are nice and smoky flavored, de-boned, and packed in their own juices.<br /><br />Chances are if you're shopping for these things in bulk online, you've already had them before so writing too detailed a review is sort of pointless.  They're a bit of an acquired taste, very strong in flavor, and not for everyone.  Shipping was fast and efficient and best of all, free.  Can't beat that.<br /><br />But for those who appreciate a good smoked kipper, you can't go wrong with these.  Highly recommended."
"Superb delicious kipper...these were so good, I sent my dad a box.<br />To break down the analytics for ya w/supersaver:<br />$25.95/box, $1.44 per can, 63.54oz @ .408/oz"
I love to eat sardines and such while fishing. I just tried the Polar Kipper Snacks and they were fantastic. My fishing buddy couldn't believe how fine they were and just kept raving on about them. I will be ordering another case sooner than expected...from now on I will have to bring 2 cans per person. A fine product.
"If you happen to be a lover of Smoked Herring, you have to try this! I'd rate it as the best!! I've tried lots of others, but these reign supreme!"
"I was introduced to Kippers in Scotland years ago. I have finally found a product that comes close to those I found there.Exceptional flavor,firm texture,and consistent quality. the price is reasonable as well."
"We like smoked kippers, and so far these are the best we've found. Having them delivered to our door makes them even better."
"A German friend of mine suggested I try these and I am glad I did. Tastes kind of like smoked bacon but not as fatty or greasy.  I was pleased to see the expiration date on the tins was four and a half years from the date they arrived at my door. Very fresh, very tasty!<br /><br />Unlike some of my other canned food purchases from Amazon, these tins arrived in perfect condition. I will be buying this 18 pack again."
"I've been trying several brands recently and these are easily the best.  Using ""Subscribe and Save"" their true delivered cost was $5.31 per pound and they will last a very long time on the shelf.  The calories are listed on the can at 81 and sodium content is only 110 mg (both great).  I suspect since I drain the liquid, the sodium is even less per serving.  With 4 or 5 crackers and a double handful of small tomatoes they make a  simple, healthy, yummy lunch.  I also like them for breakfast with eggs and capers.  Next I am going to try a sandwich like others have mentioned.  I'm certain you will appreciate these better quality Kippers having just the right flavor."
"I've been eating Brunswick kipper snacks for 15 years, but decided to try these when I saw 'em at Walmart. I really enjoyed them! I found them to have a firmer texture and more smoke flavor, and the ribs in the fillets were either not there or were cooked down more thoroughly. The fillets were more intact and seemed to be of slightly better quality too. Also, for what it's worth, the can is easier to open and drain without getting fish juice on your hands. ;-) Good stuff! My new favorite!"
"I have tried the mustard and tomato, even ones in dill sauce, but these are BY far the best. Can't beat smoked fish! Smoked fish is usually expensive when you by it at the store fresh and you have to eat it right away, but these are great because you can have them whenever and it's a perfect portion, and cheap, with no bones to pick out! I love these with cheese and beer."
"I eat a lot of these kippers.  I've tried others, these are very tasty.<br /><br />But I'm curious.<br /><br />I buy the 3.53oz tins.  The ingredients listed on the tin are Herring fillets (85%), water, seasonings (with celery, soy, gluten), sugar, natural flavoring, dextrose, smoke.<br /><br />when you go to the mwpolar website, they only have the 3.54oz tins and list the ingredients as smoked fillets of herring, salt.<br /><br />Are these two cans different?  Is this just a US label?"
"If you like a good healthy snack,look no further. This is the 8th case I've ordered and still find them the best around. Consistent quality and great taste."
These are the best Kipper Snacks!  I used to be able to find them in my local grocery store but suddenly they are no longer available.  Great product.  Nutritious light dinner served with chopped onions and tomatoes on my favorite cracker. Yummmm...
"KIPPERS ARE GREAT FOR A FAST SNACK.  JUST SPREAD A PIECE OF GOOD BREAD WITH BUTTER, A FEW THIN SLICES OF ONION AND THE KIPPERS.  HEALTHY SNACK!!!!"
"Very tasty. Smoky flavor and firm flesh with small amount of water. Check your local grocer, I bought it at my local Walmart at $1.18 per can."
"Polar Kipper Snacks are sweet, smokey and firm fillets. They are less expensive than some other brands I used to buy, and of much higher quality.  In addition, ordering them through Amazon was fast, simple and a pleasure.  This was not my first order of this wonderful product, and it will not be the last.  Try them."
"I am in agreement with other reviewers who praised the minimal ingredient list on this Polar product.  How nice!  Just smoked herring, water, and salt.  The smokiness level seems just right to me, too -- not too little, but not overwhelming either.  You can't beat the subscribe-and-save option.  You rock, Amazon!"
Impeccable taste.  Eat it right out of the can if youwantu. Perfectly seasoned and smoked.  Great on Crackers. Perfect with your favorite hot sauce.
"I eat kipper snacks and sardines 2-3 times a week. Usually at work because they are quick and easy. These POLAR Kipper snacks have great smoke flavor, very clean, and delicious. I bought them for about $1.30 a can. Worth every penny. I like the King Oscar brand also but they cost more. The POLAR are my new top pick. Thanks AMAZON."
"I bought this item with some doubt in my mind as I'm not that fond of the usual run of the mill herring, even the fancy kind.  But I do value it's nutritional value and try to incorporate it in my diet once in a while.  I was really surprised at this delicious version. There is no hint of fishiness whatsoever and the smoke flavor is mild and not overpowering.  I LOVE it. Shelf life is long too, another plus.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone."
"We all know that we need to get more Omega 3's. From heart health to brain health there is ample evidence that fish such as salmon, herring and sardines are very, very good for our health. The Polar Kippered snacks are consistently delicious, not too fishy with a light smokey flavor. I have these baby's on automatic delivery so I don't run out. I eat a can a day. Just drain the water and consume. You might try them on crackers or in a salad... but I gobble them up au natural! (I'm off all wheat products..). I get them for about a $1 a can... cheaper then my local super market.  Every once in awhile I'll splurge on some relatively expensive sardines...but these are my daily staples! Highly recommended!"
"---<br /><br />I usually by the Crown Price sardines in Louisiana hot sauce, but I wanted a change so I tried these.<br /><br />And man are they good! The smoked flavor is so nice.<br /><br />I definitely recommend them.<br /><br />---"
Very tasty.  Kinda like a cross between a sardine (consistency) and smoked mullet or trout (smoky flavor).  Very much recommended!
"These Kippers are very tasty the flavor compares to Appel Kippers only the consistency is compared to the big meaty Appel Kippers slightly mushy this varies from can to can on the ones I have eaten so far. That being said the price is so good I intend to continue to purchase these as they are great in a salad or anything along those lines.<br /><br />Really great smoked flavor not a hint of fishiness. If you have a taste for kippers give these a try the price is downright cheap for the quality. If you have never tried kippers you may be in for a treat.<br /><br />I have turned several folks onto Kippers who have never had any smoked fish or some lousy stuff and most of them complained of the aroma when I was eating Kippers (especially at breakfast) but once they actually ate some suddenly they converted on the spot.<br /><br />These are second on my list of Kippers behind Appel but for the price difference it is a no-brainier to grab some of these Polar Kipper Snacks at about a buck and a quarter a can, wow what a bargain.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  High Quality for a Low Price."
"you cant go wrong with the deal you get on these,best tasting compared to any 5 star quality guys"
"These have a great flavor and are a good source of protein.  They have a bit of salt in them but that is hard to avoid.  1 can is 2 servings but  I ususally eat the whole can at once.  I recommend them if you like to snack on canned fish foods like sardines, etc..."
"These fillets are so tasty!  Very tender, no bones or skin and low in sodium.  High in Omega 3.  I was buying these at the market until they raised the price...now the price here is the best I have found."
"These are not sardines, but herring.  I like this brand of kipper snacks because olive oil is used.  My 13 year old loves these as well.  We take them skiing or hiking with us.  The one bad thing is the smell - fishy smell.  In fact, my son loves these so much he use to take to school until he was teased about the fishy smell.  If you like tuna, you will probably like this product.  I like to eat these on crackers.  This is a great price at Amazon.  In the store where I live, a can of kipper snacks cost at least $3.25 each."
"These kipper snacks are very tasty and worth the money...but, the nutrition label shows a serving size as a half a can.  So if you ate the whole can at one sitting (and who doesn't?!) you get 20% of your ""daily requirements"" of sodium!  That's a little harsh!  And the North Seas have some bad pollution issues...are these fish taken from those waters?  I wonder... (I only gave it 4 stars because of the nutrition label, as other kipper snacks I've bought list a serving size as a whole can and they were all of the same weight.)"
I eat one of these snacks everyday to help control my diabetes. Two fish instead of a bag of junk food is great!!
"Received my order today and within minutes had a can open.  For years we have only eaten Brunswick Kippers but am having trouble finding them in area stores.  The last two cans we bought were different from what we always ate.  Watery, less flavor and odd pieces of fish.  I am especially impressed that Polar Kipper only has three ingredients, all of which we can pronounce and are familiar with.  We will be going on a subscription.  The can we opened did not even make it to a cracker!  Less smoky but the fish was cut into filets rather than mashed pieces and though salt was the only seasoning, it was not overwhelming.  Jewish Holidays are coming in September. MW Polar Kipper Snacks are going to make a grateful gift to my neighbor."
"I have been ordering polar kippers on autoship from amazon for some time. Makes a quick and easy breakfast for me, and has served as a good substitute for breakfast bacon for me. While they still have fat, they are good fats. the smoky and salty flavor satisfy my taste at the same time. I eat a whole can which is supposed to be two servings, but even then it comes to a total of 162 calories.<br /><br />I have had on occasional problem with a lid not coming off cleanly but it wasn't a big deal to work around. Also some cans will vary slightly in the contents but it all averages out, especially when you eat them on a regular basis as I do.<br /><br />Buying on autoship is the cheapest way by far to get kippers with free shipping I am usually around $1.10 or so a can vs. $1.50+ in my local grocery. Plus I get a regular supply which fits nicely into my every other day or so diet plan."
We have ordered this twice each time getting twice the order. Like the price and free shipping.<br />All of our family loves kippers and the cost is twice as much in the stores. Good product convenient.
"This is a great product.  The kipper is canned in the whole filets, great smell, great taste.  Probably the best brand of kipper snacks I've tried."
Amazon shipped this rapidly and the product arrived in good condition<br /><br />Pro:<br />The kippers are tasty.<br />Good value for money<br /><br />Cons<br />Kippers are small<br />The kippers are packaged with a lot of water.<br />The total amount of fish is less than from similar but higher priced products at Amazon
"Please don't tell anyone about these Polar Kipper Snacks!<br /><br />I am afraid if the word gets out about just HOW GOOD THESE ARE, there might be a shortage of them.<br /><br />These are, without a doubt, the single BEST canned type of fish in existence. Nice large fillets of firm fish, individually trimmed, PERFECTLY smoked, and packed in the lightest of brine.<br /><br />They TASTE LIKE CANDY!<br /><br />Really, just like CANDY.<br /><br />I used to give cans of Sardines out for Halloween, but I refuse to since I found this product. I don't want to share these with ANYONE! (Especially that little Norwegian kid down the street that changes his Halloween costume and comes back to the door for Sardines two and three times)<br /><br />As I can afford it, I will be filling my basement with cases of this product in preparation for the 2012 End of the World Event.<br /><br />Nothing Better. A Bit 'o Heaven in a Can."
"These are okay. I've been getting Brunswick as long as I can remember and thought I'd try these because they cost a bit less. These are much, much milder. They are not as smokey or fishy. I think I like the consistency of these better, they aren't as flaky and each filet comes from a single fish. If the price difference between this fish and King Oscar and Brunswick remain as high, I'll probably get them again."
"Come on, Amazon. I can buy them cheaper @my local supermarket. I pay $1.29 a piece, there. That's about $2.00 a case less than what you want."
"These are are loose packed in a LOT of water. They are soft and slimy as a result. I couldn't force them down.<br /><br />I recommend the more expensive Brunswick or Prince Albert herring, which is what I am used to."
"Despite the fact that the ""nutritional information"" on Amazon states that this product is only herring, water, and salt, the cans state that GLUTEN is part of the deal.  I am feeding my cans to my dogs, who incidentally love the flavor.<br />BTW, what the hell is gluten doing in a can of fish?"
"I am in love with this chocolate.  Does it taste like Caramel?  No--it's better.  More complex.  And better for you to boot.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this, you should.<br /><br />I tried it because I've switched to primal/paleo eating and I don't think I could go back to regular commercial chocolate after this!"
"Remarkable, in my view, taste. But most importantly, it's a raw organic product with great nutritional value. Get one bar in the morning, and chances are you won't need any coffee. It packs a lot of energy for me. Worth a try for you I think."
"A luscious layer of ""caramel"" sandwiched between two velvety smooth layers of fine raw cacao.  As soon as you bite into this bar you'll be captivated by the contrasting textures and flavors that compliment each other to perfection.  Comes complete with nutrients and a long lasting energetic mood lift.  The wondrous world of raw vegan food just got a little better."
"I admit it...I love most of the Rightously Raw bars. But this is my favorite! And yeah, yeah...it doesn't taste exactly like caramel. But come on! That's like expecting soy milk to taste exactly like cow's milk! Not gonna happen. I think the folks at Rightously Raw got this one...well...right. The filling has a richness & depth that are reminiscent of caramel, the chocolate is superb, and you can enjoy it with total peace of mind. I'll take that any day over a sugar-bomb of ""real"" caramel!"
"What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the ""worst"" of ""simple sugars"", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and ""Caramel"", are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
"At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, ""Caramel""). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar."

It's delicious, just don't expect that dairy flavor.<br />This brand's other bars, Acai and Goji, are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand. I've tried all the different flavors and they're to LIVE for. I feel really healthy after eating some of this chocolate. I would recommend buying it at a local health food store because they're quite expensive to order here. I have the same thing to say about their other flavors.
"I read some glowing reviews on blogs of these bars and decided to try this one as it was considered the ""best tasting"" by many.<br /><br />The outer chocolatre itself is good, but the ""caramel truffle"" had a quite unpleasant taste that I did not like at all. After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat."
"I do not even know where to start, horrible texture, grainy, sweet, no flavor...<br />Is there really chocolate in it? If i did not live so far from the store I would have<br />taken it back, did I say overpriced? I would not even try the other flavors, yuck!"

"These were selling in my gym and I decided to try this and the Caraeml (which I reviewed separately and gave two stars).<br /><br />I managed to eat two bites of the caramel. I spat out the first bite of this one. It tastes disgusting. Furthermore, despite it not being passed its sell-by-date (two months from now) it looks bad. The caramel bar looks like dark chocolate; this looks like medium brown sand.<br /><br />Definitely the worst chocolate I've ever had (and in a world full of Hershey's that is saying something)."
"This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the ""caramel"" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was."
These blondies are great. The butter rum sauce is just amazing. Unbelieveable item. Just wish there were multi packs to save a little $.
"Kroger sells one for $12.00, and Wal-mart sells one for $9.99. So how is two for $41.00 a deal or ever a good price?"
"I had already done the math before looking at the reviews, and I was a bit surprised by the reviews that said this is over-priced. It works out to $7 per 33 oz. unit, and if using subscribe and save (getting a 15% discount) the cost per 33 oz. unit is $5.95, (.18 cents an ounce compared to .25 cents an ounce of another popular brand) and it's free shipping and you don't have to hope there's a sale when you need it. Now how can you complain about that? I'm adding it to my cart."
How is $16 a jug a good deal?  I get the same products in the same size at my local Walmart for $7 a jug.
The handle on the Maxwell House container is a great innovation. While making coffee in the am and being half asleep it's good to have a way to comfortably hang on to the coffee and get my day going.  Great coffee in a good size container.
"Of the various grinds that Maxwell House produces, this is our favorite.  To be quite honest, I (we) can tell little difference between this product and the like product produced and sold by Folgers.  Coffee, like so many other things in life is purely a matter of choice and to a great extent, what you get use to.  When it comes right down to it, we usually buy what ever is on sale at the time of purchase.  More about that later.<br /><br />Now I am a person that enjoyed a milder, less intense coffee; less intense that what we find in this product.  My wife enjoys a strong, robust and flavorful coffee (which this grind of Maxwell House is), so we compromise and go with the strong, robust and flavorful grind of coffee.  Hey, you have to pick your battles you know.<br /><br />Now neither my wife nor I are what you would call coffee snobs; an unfortunate term, I know, but I use it here just to make a point.  I realize that there are many, many individuals who prefer to buy their own coffee beans; fresh coffee beans, grind them and go from there.  This is a good thing.  I have had many a cup of coffee prepared as such and have enjoyed them...for the most part.  In our case though, the extra time involved, the extra cost involved; for both the bean and a quality grinder, and the extra hassle simply is not worth it.  We drink two pots of coffee daily, at the very least.  This is a personal choice though and each person must pick their own path and choose what is best for them and their situation.<br /><br />I am setting here writing this review drinking a cup of coffee.  It is the Folgers equivalent to the Maxwell grind being reviewed here.  The reason for this is that we are able to get it on sale at the time of purchase.  To be honest, I cannot tell a whole lot of difference from the last can we opened which happened to be Maxwell House.  It does taste better due to the fact I got a good buy on it and the saving of my coinage makes it much sweeter.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon, as of this writing, is quite good and extremely competitive if you have one of the programs here that include free or reduced shipping.  Amazon's Subscription program can save you a lot of money if you are a heavy shopper here...no doubt.<br /><br />This is a good product, we like it and the cost here is very good at this time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"
"Amazon, what are you hiding...this is the second time trying to post a review on what appears to be incorrectly labeled (at the very least) product. This is NOT 100% Arabica bean coffee.  The label on the description and what arrived are NOT the same.  Caveat emptor."
"Hands down, the best mass-produced coffee, in my house! This is now a Kraft product, and Kraft is King of Quality and taste. This is what you want to choose among the oogles of coffee brands out there. MAXWELLS'(kraft)IN THE HOUSE!"
"Excellent value with supermarket prices on coffee escalating, Amazon.com's Subscribe and Save price with $0 shipping and handling is the best value out there!"
I admit it I'm a coffee addict. Whether its Starbucks or McD's I must get my coffee. I've tried many different brands and for me the Maxwell French Roast is a great strong coffee and is at a very reasonable price on Amazon.<br /><br />If you have prime it gets here quick as well.
"I have been using this coffee for years. French Roast is our favorite...however. the price is extremely HIGH...we paid (at the highest) $9.99 in East Hampton, NY in the month of August.  the regular price at Hannaford Supermarkets in NYS is approx. $6.00...... Price Chopper has it on sale quite often @ $5.99 with a special iSave coupon and you then get it for $4.99.<br />the size of this is 34.5 oz.<br /><br />How come it is soooo high at Amazon????"
Very good coffee - I can get it much cheaper through Amazon than I can locally.  I have signed up to get two 33 oz cans a month.  It comes well packaged and fresh.
"I have purchased this product twice in the 29.3 oz size. Both times, I have been disappointed. As a French Roast aficionado, I know what French Roast coffee should look and smell like. True French Roast coffee bean and grounds should be almost black in color with a pungent, almost burnt, aroma. These characteristic are imparted from the ""over roasting"" process which brings out the distinguishing flavor and aroma of the coffee beans. Furthermore, during the roasting process, the French Roast beans lose more moisture than normally roasted coffee beans. Therefore, the French Roast grounds have lower density and weighs less than normally roasted beans for an equivalent volume. The Maxwell House French roast has none of the traditional French Roast characteristics. The grounds color is much lighter than that of true French Roast, the aroma is not like true French Roast grounds, and the flavor is just like regular roast coffee. In addition, the grounds have the same density as regular Roast Coffee grounds. I am very disappointed with Maxwell House brand French Roast. Someone in the Coffee Division should learn how to properly roast the French Roast coffee."
"I love maxwell house coffee, especially the French roast. I am very prone to heartburn and this one is rich and solid tasting, without making me suffer, after.<br /><br />That said I see tons of people saying this is a great value.... where do you live? Our local walmart has these for under 9 bucks, for the 33oz. This offer with the shipping comes to 20 bucks a Jug, lol. That is NOT a good price."
I couldn't resist Maxwell House Coffee at this price. We drink several cups a day and go through small cans in much too little time. The order was delivered VERY quicklyu. And the price was right!
"I love Maxwell House French Roast coffee; however, the price in the supermaket has been skyrocketing. I was very happy to get this coffee at such a good price."
"I buy the coffee for a group of teachers at school, so I buy in quantity. First I tried the Folgers ""%100 Colombian"" and then later this Maxwell House ""French Roast"". Folgers was better. It had more coffee flavor but this could be just the difference between a ""French Roast"" versus ""%100 Colombian"". Anyway, in a comparison of these brands and styles, I liked the Folgers better which had a little stronger flavor."
I have been buying the Maxwell House French Roast for quite some time and I think it is one of the best Maxwell Brews on the market.  It is full bodied and tasty.  I am now getting it on subscription at Amazon and that makes for a great price on this product.
"I am delighted with my Maxwell House Coffee.  I have NO PLANS TO CANCEL THIS ORDER!  This coffee works great in my new BUNN Coffee Maker.  The last time I served coffee to a friend, she inquired about the type of coffee I was using.  When I told her ""Maxwell House,"" she seemed a little surprised.  In todays coffee-hype era, we think there has to be some type of gimmick to make the coffee taste great.  WRONG!  We just need to sit down to a great tasting cup of good old Maxwell House.  It worked for my mother and it does now for me, too.  It also doesn't hurt to know that the price I pay is for two 33 ounce jugs and not just the one for that great price!  Keep it up Amazon and pretty soon I will be purchasing EVERYTHING from you!<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Becky Stewart"
Received my shipment very quickly and love the product...Maxwell House coffee always great and the French Roast<br />is one of the best.  Love being able to have it come to my door and at a great cost.  Have it set to receive automatically from now on.  Love ordering from Amazon!!!!
"The packaging is great.<br /><br />I keep coffee upside-down in the refrigerator. That is supposed to keep it fresher. Usually, when you open a container that was kept upside-down, the contents spill from the cover. Not with this container. I'm very impressed!<br /><br />Of more importance, the coffee is delicious!"
"Maxwell house makes a nice strong coffee that tastes great. I like it as much as I like Folgers and the price is in my budget. The canisters ship without any problems, they are strong and unbreakable."
I Like a Dark Rich Coffee Which is usually significantly more in price than House blends This French Roast is a good tasting Coffee and compares to other brands priced MUCH Higher
"Excellent blend - uses less to get the full flavored taste.  Makes great pot of Iced Coffee also - where many others leave a nasty taste in mouth.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK"">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Buy using Amazon's great 'Subscribe & Save*' one can match the Grocery store prices."
"i am just about to order this from amazon when i started to read the 5 reviews.  maybe because i live and shop in new york, but, WHAT IS THE BEEF ABOUT THE PRICE?  my supermarket sells the regular can (11 oz) of maxwell house french roast for $3.99.  all the other supermarkets, a&p, pathmark, etc., sell for the same price and some a $1.00 more.  that make it 33 oz (3 cans worth) for $12.00. here, i am getting 6 can worth for $13.00.  AM I MISSING SOMETHING?  maybe it just logistics...you think!<br /><br />2/2/11 - UPDATE....i WAS going to reorder the coffee but it seems that it is no longer available from amazon.  a third-party is selling the pack of two for over $30.00.  oh well, at least i can get ONE 33oz jug for #$13.00 at duane reade instead of the TWO jugs from amazon.<br /><br />6/1/11 - UPDATE.....on may 8, 2011, i ordered TWO 2-packs for $15.58 each or $31.16 for four 33oz jugs which amazon sold itsself. i want to stock up for the iced coffee afternoons and lo and behold, amazon itself (NOT a third-party) is now selling this coffee for over $30.00 for a two-pack -- in less than 4 weeks time. if i can't get it from amzon, the third-parties rarely has a chance and, in this case, none!  amazon has just lost a customer on this item."
Coffe is very good-nice flavor-not to strong not to weak & never bitter. I would have to be nuts to buy it on Amazon. Price is way to high. When Amazon lowers their price to seven or eight dollars-I will buy it but never at their present prices. Talk about consumer rip-off!
"Granted, coffee is high. But at least every 8 weeks or so, this goes on sale for $5.99 or $6.99 per 33-ounce jug at my local Kroger.  Why is it so high on Amazon?"
"Hard to review coffee.  Unless it's just flat out bad, it is truly a matter of personal preference.  This is definitely not bad coffee, but I prefer a smoother, milder blend.  You may prefer stronger, bolder coffee, in which case this may be great for you.  I don't.  I prefer Folger's Classic Roast, or Maxwell House Master Blend."
"I found this is one of the easiest ways to shop for coffee. The Subsribe and Save program saves you money and you never wake up to an empty can. priced well and I prefer Maxwell House or Folgers better than the fancy coffee house brands. Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2).<br />A trip to store, $10 , two canisters of coffee $16, plus tax and hassle. Have is delivered free without tax for $18. Without the hassle.<br /><br />Maxwell House still has that GOOD TO THE LAST DROP taste and flavor. I recommend this product when you can find it sold through the Subscribe and Save program."
"My g/f got me a popcorn maker for Xmas. Knowing that I really only go to the movies anymore just for the popcorn, we decided to try and replicate it on our own.  There are several ways to achieve that. Mainly the oil and salt topping, but kernels should not be over looked.  I went with this gift set because it has 6 types of kernels ranging from very light and airy(think carnival or circus popcorn) to medium grade and color(movie theaterish but better) to dark and small(cant compare to anything).  It also comes with popcorn salt and butter topping that seal the deal. The southwestern spice is delicious but I rarely use it on the fresh batches.  I prefer to save it for the tail end as it makes me sneeze.  I rate this 5 stars and would certainly recommend to a friend. Best of all you can sample about 5-8 batches of each flavor before you decide which kernel you want to buy in bulk.  They are all great, but my favorite is the Red River valley with 2 parts salt to 1 part butter topping.<br /><br />**You will want to buy some coconut oil to pop in for the true theater taste and color."
"I bought the kit a few weeks ago. I did as instructed, except I placed a plastic baggie over the top to make a little greenhouse.  Now I have DOZENS of baby catnip plants. The kit arrived promptly and has met all my expectations."
"I kill plants, this one has survived so far. That makes it a win in my book. The instructions were easy, and it's growing quickly even after a replanting. I highly recommend!"
product comes with water absorbing crystals. If you add too much water they expand to over twice the container size. never did get to see if it would grow other wise.
The catnip was slow growing at first.  The seeds sprouted in the little container after about two weeks.  At one month I transplanted it to a bigger pot and now it is growing like crazy.  I'm very happy and so are my cats.
I received the catnip kit.  Right away I put the kit together and put it in my greenhouse.  The catnip grew as the instructions said.  Thank you.
at first I only have one or two sprout and they died :-(.  I continued to water it and now it's full of life.  two weeks in and there are about 20 or so and they are starting to shoot up.
"I wouldn't buy this product again if it was 'free'...  I followed the directions to the letter, and all I got was a sterile cup of soil that ended up molding over time.  When I tried to contact Gimborn Pet Specialties about it, noone ever responded to my emails or letters..."
"Bought this as a gift for a friend. They loved the idea of growing catnip, so I was happy to find this. It arrived and they were excited.<br /><br />Yes, it would be easier to buy some catnip, but it is fun to grow plants, especially if it benefits your cat!"
"Great little ""chia"" like gift for a cat lover! Got to see it grow, super fast. Good product and great price!!Even cheaper now then when i bought mine!"
"well, kitty didn't get any catnip. followed directions and i still have a container of dirt. first amazon ordered product that was not what was advertised. what a shame. poor kitty."
"Had great hopes for this --- however, it never bloomed.  Disappointing because I wanted to give my ""babies"" something they would enjoy."
"Poor instructions, takes forever to grow and must be repotted.  I have a ""green thumb"" and my plants are still only 1/2"" tall after almost 2 months. You're much better off just buying some catnip seeds and using your own potting soil and pot.  Any pot would look better than the cheap plastic tub provided.<br /><br />It's not catnip but I highly recommend the Kitty Garden:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ID2E"">SmartCat 3844 Kitty?s Garden Edible Grass Planter</a>  It grows fast, looks good and my kittens love it."
"I bought this cat nip package and also bought cat grass kit for my 3 cats cause they love their greens but the cat nip hardly grew at all and this is not the first time ive tried to grow it for my cats, the cat grass on the other hand was awesome and cats enjoyed it definitely will buy more grass but not the cat nip. Not impressed with the product at all :("
"When I first saw this product, I was so excited as my cat loves catnip and is a real ""greens"" eater.  I read the directions and the previous reviews, so I could avoid the usual stumbling blocks.  It is now three (3) weeks later, I have perhaps 4-5 little sprouts that cannot be seen unless the container is in front of your face.  I am so disappointed.  What a waste of the purchase price."
"Within a month or two I had counted about 60 lil catnip plants growing.  But, the instructions suck.  This was my first time growing anything before.  I had to look up on the internet why my catnip plants started to not do so well. I learned that they were growing long and spindly from not getting enough sun.  And that I was watering them wrong with too much water at a time.  Plus I waited waay too long to replant and separate them.<br /><br />This is kind of a ripoff.  What you get is around 70-80 seeds and a tiny cup of dirt.  Looking on amazon, I could buy 400 catnip seeds for around $2-3, a bag of potting soil for $3 and a small pot, but larger than the cup, for a buck."
"I'm reviewing this product for consumers: it takes a long time to get anywhere near ready for use.  That doesn't mean the product isn't good, but expect to wait months before using,"
I thought I was getting plants...I can't believe I paid all this money for seeds and a tablespoon of soil and a plastic dish...lesson learned read all the way to the bottom off the description no matter how much jibberish there is in between! Even the picture looks like live plants...
"We opened the covere and added water, we waited for weeks, but nothing grew! our cat ran away before we let her enjoy the ""imported"" catnip."
Couldn't find a quantity - how much product is in this package? Is it a secret? Don't you know? This is an important piece of information.
hmm... yeah i like them and my dad does too. i think they are one of the best out ther
I wear out before the flavor does. I've never had gum as long-lasting.
"It's summertime, and everyone who enjoys the German beer gardens knows that it's the season for hefe weizen!<br />Dark amber in color and opaque from top fermenting yeast, this hefe weizen drinks easily and finishes slightly sour on the palate.  It's a good summertime beer -- full of flavor yet not overly heavy.  Admittedly, I have had other hefe weizens that I've liked a little bit more.  However, this is still a very respectable beer, worthy of merit.  This beer will definitely make my secondary rotation; when I'm looking for something a little bit different, I will keep this one in mind."
"Wow!!! This is a great stuff. I had used the product before then had trouble locating it. Now that I have found a place to purchase it, I will be coming back."
"These bowls clean up real nice, and I have a Jack Russell and another small (10 lb) terrier and this bowl is the perfect size, I can fill it up and know that thats how much they should be getting. The rubber grip thing on the bottom doesn't like to stay on, but as long as your not carrying the dish around its alright. I did have some of the ink smear on the side of the dish the first time I washed it."
"I bought these for my dog thinking that they would be the perfect way to give him his thyroid medication (he has thyroid problems and must take a tiny pill each morning and evening).  I thought that I would mix up his usual peanut butter on a biscuit and I think that this was the perfect way to go!  The treats are soft enough for me to put a pill into one of them by just firmly pressing and my dog loves them!  Plus, they are small enough that I can feed a few of them to my Great Dane at one time (but they are not so small that he feels cheated and doesn't really taste anything).<br />I am a big fan of Cloud Star brand treats and these are no exception - the ingredients are all real and recognizable and I feel comfortable feeding them to my dog.  Big fan of these!"
These are not anything like the bangers I enjoyed while living there.  I was really looking forward to showing my friends what a banger was like and why i've missed them so much. I won't be sharing these with anyone!
"My mom is Irish, and on those special days, we had bangers, black/white and hash. These bangers are the closest I've come in Wyoming."
"Wife used this pack on our 10 mile excursion into the San Juan Wilderness area. Seems to work just o.k. The only real complaint is the non-standard hydration bladder compartment. I purchased two camelback bladders. My pack has two vertical compartments in main section. This pack uses a ""square"" bladder in the fanny pack section. We just zipped her bladder in the vertical outside pocket. Worked pretty good that way. Being able to access the bottom of the pack without unloading everything is a nice feature. It is just o.k. because of the price, and non-standard hydration compartment. Also, unrolling 4 feet(exageration) of material to load top is a pain."
I bought these because one of my cats is diabetic and is not supposed to have gluten.  Neither of our cats is finicky in the least (they will eat sock lint) but they will NOT eat these treats.  Wasted my money.
"These Belgium chocolates are really something, they are so so good. If you are crazy for chocolate this one is a must to taste. I rated them 5 star.<br /><br />Leo"
My dog is a very picky eater but he loves this food and since switching to it we have no more stomach problems or leg (bone growth) problems and he seems to have much more energy.Highly recommend!
I really like this flavor. It's not too strong or mild. I thought this was a great product at a great value.
"This is not the first time I have purchased this product..The first time the product came packaged very nicely in a styrofoam box and was frozen,,,and after I had cooked it it was great..Anyway this time when I got the roast the first thing iI noticed was it came in a plain box with only 2 melted ice packs and in some sort of silver colored material.....The meat was discolored on one end and it smelled horrible!!!OMG what a waste..The meat was sooo bad it looked like it had been shipped and had turned rotten before it was shipped!!! I am sorry if my grammer is rather jumbled..But I am very upset....Shame on this company for sending a customer rotten meat!! Please do not under any circumstances buy from this company ever!! :("
"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."
"I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"
"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al"
"I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."
"Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious."
I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.
"I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?"
"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."
"For those who like a bit more flavor than the soft breakfast blends -- this is the best of the bunch.  I have worked through most brand ""bolds"" and come back to this one every time.  Black Tiger is similar but does not have some of the added flavor notes found here."
I looked all over to buy Sugar in the Raw that was packaged individually and this was the only place I could find them. They are great - i got hooked on this sweetener at Starbucks and now I can have it at home.
"Its like having dessert at my favorite Indian restaurant. I add a slash of canned milk. If you like cardamon, you will love this. Comes in individual one serving packets. Delicious."
The candy have a very soft texture with the perfect amount of sugar coating. Fresh but I didn't find much fruit flavor. I will not buy them again since local stores sell similar product and I don't need to have it shipped.
"First off, this is one of the best candies I've ever tasted - and I say that having had many Haribo candies. I took advantage of a candy store in Vigo, Spain to stock up on Haribo before heading back home to America, but alas, I ran out and had to find a way to restock.<br /><br />You may have noticed that you can get a 5 lb bag of many Haribo candies for less than double the price of this item, which is a great value, but is not advisable if you are like me and do not trust yourself with that much delicious candy being in your presence at one time. This 1.5 pound bag is much more splurge-friendly (still unhealthy, but less so). And if you have a Prime membership like I do this is a great deal, and I feel like this American packaging keeps the candy from melting as appears to be a common problem with the 5 pound bags.<br /><br />A pesar de todo, the low price makes this item a good choice if you want to try a great candy without commiting to a huge amount or resigning yourself to having to drive around the US in attempt to track this down in a clandestine candy shop."
"My 2 dogs were on pro plan when they became adult dogs there digestive system changed and they had problems pooping they strain when they had to poop and  my other dog kept scratching and licking her paws & feet constantly. I took her to the vet and he told me to give her beneryal which really didn't work and gave me penalog which didn't work for too long, the vet said it may be the food it was a process of elimination to find what was causing allergies and the problem with their digestion and why when my dog pooped it was a strain for her to eliminate. I decided to change the food I went online to see what kind of dry food I should buy there were so many to choose from which made it more confusing what to choose. My neighbor said she gives her dogs Natural Balance for allergies and digestion. I went online and checked out the food and decided to get grain free Limited Ingrdient Diet chicken w/sweet potato for small breeds and hoped this would help my 2 dogs. It didn't take long to see the difference they no longer strained pooping the scratching and licking are still there but not like it was. My dog seemed to be relief and seemed relaxed since the scratching & licking wasn't severe as before she was able to play without stopping to scratch every second. Both dogs skin and coat look better then it ever looked. They have been eating this food 4 months and I couldn't believe by changing their food that it could make such a difference. Both my dogs are happy and if they're happy so am I.<br /><br />Natural Balance has many dry foods to choose from like organic food, vegetrian food, special weight management and special food for the senior dog. The best thing about this food is puppies and adult dogs can eat the same food. You don't have to buy food for puppies only. I hope this is helpful to those who can't decide which brand is best. Try Natural Balance check out the website to see all their products to decide which food is best for your best friend.<br /><br />My little babies are happy with their new food.<br />Suzan<br />Mesquite Nevada"
"I know ""Sweet Potato and Chicken"" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a ""Limited Ingredient Diet"" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for ""chicken fat"" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members."
"Our one dog constantly had dried out skin, and has always been such a picky eater, she'll starve before she eats something she doesn't like.  Our puppy also had stool that smelled just awful, and I get that poop always smells, but I've had dogs my entire life, and nothing compared. Thank god for this food. She's paper trained, and I don't know what I would have done without this. It was just awful...and both of the dogs love this food as much as they love their treats, it's awesome to be able to purchase one food that they can both eat(and LOVE!)"
"Both my dogs like this product, one of our dogs has a very sensitive stomach and its the only brand we allow her to eat! we give them a variety of choice within the sweet potato recipes."
"My dogs eats Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe (15 pound bag) and  and likes it.  I ordered more on June 4th.  Amazon told me that it is not available for delivery.  Yet on the website, it is listed as available though stock seems low..  Where is my delivery?"
"My bad, I fell for it - limited ingredients don't mean diddly unless the ingredients are good. I failed to squint and didn't notice it's more chicken meal than chicken -  apparently our dog is allergic to something in it and it gives him nasty gas, I do mean nasty."
"I have 3 dogs and a foster dog and have had multiple other fosters over the past year.  My second dog was a rescue and came to me with a case of Giardia and persistent diarrhea for 4 months.  I tried countless types of food and realized she was allergic to Turkey, Apples, Peas, ect.  This food is simple and cuts out all the ridiculous, useless ingredients most commercial foods now cram into their kibble.  I give this to all my dogs and fosters and everybody tolerates it very well.  It is one of the only brands of food you can find that doesn't have 15+ ingredients in it and sweet potato is tolerated much better by my sensitive pup than brown or white rice or barley.  I do not feed them anything else.  If your dog is itchy, sneezy, or has weird poops...it is probably a food allergy (assuming they are dewormed and up to date on vaccinations!)."
I have a dog with a sensitive stomach.  We have tried countless brands of dog food including designer and organic brands along with Purina.  Every food led unpredictable vomiting.  The worst being the fancy organic brands with the bits of dried vegetables.  On the recommendation of a pet store clerk I tried the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diet Sweet Potato and Chicken Formula.  My dog is happy and does not vomit.  We are happy.  I have never looked back.  Amazon has the best prices and free shipping.  It worked for my dog.  Give it a try!
"I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat. She was scratching her skin off and licking constantly. The vet prescribed everything under the sun, antibiotics, special shampoos, special dog food, including a certain amount of sunlight daily. After months of testing, meds and specialties, including cooking her special diet,with nothing working,I decided to try a different approach and came across this dog food. Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now. And when you break down the price for the larger bag as opposed to the Pedigree, etc, it comes out pretty good price wise. The vet bill alone was killing me anyway. The smaller bags will eat away at your wallet if you go thru dog food quickly. I bought those only as a try out. Their stools are solid, although I do not notice less waste as some report. And with free ship qualification on most orders, it makes it a little easier on the pocket book."
"I have an 8 month old shiba inu/chihuahua mix puppy and from the time I got him at 4 months old he has never had a solid poop. I took him to vets and after 7 rounds of medicines he still has soft poop. The vet has him on ID and I can't say that it works consistently, he still has soft poops everyday but now there are some poops that are normal. I was running out of the ID brand dog food and was going to go back to the vets to buy another bag for $40 and they were out so I went to the pet store and looked at what they had in the way of limited ingredient dog food. I saw this and bought a small bag to see if his poop improved or not. So I will let everyone know how it is once he's been on the food for a few weeks."
"I ordered 5 lb of this candy, and it was great. So great in fact that I ate a lot of it. After a few days, my teeth became incredibly sensitive from the amount of acid in this candy. Sour candy gets its sour from different kinds of acid, and this candy is so sour, it's really bad for your teeth. Eating a lot of sour candy of any kind will begin to damage the enamel on your teeth."
"Most everyone knows cry baby tears candy. Delicious and sour!<br /><br />But the best and most important part of this review is to tell all those who own a carousel gumball machine that this candy is absolutely compatible (They will fint) and dispense alot for your coin. My machine is set up for the standard penny and the machine dispensed 8 peices!!!<br /><br />The machine I have is the classic 37"" Carousel Gumball Bank and stand. After the gumballs were all gone I wanted something new and different. Something I liked (not that I don't like gumballs). You can find this gumball machine here on Amazon. Just an FYI if you ARE ordering standard gumballs make sure they are the half (1/2) inch gumballs! The 1 inch ones are too big. I learned the hard way.<br /><br />Delicious candy and I anticipate I'll be coming back for more. Besides, the kids and neighbors will love it  :)"
"5lbs is a lot, but the candy coating actually helps preserve it.  The only bad part about this is this form doesn't come with the purple color/flavor."
Good stuff!!  Seems like i remember the kind in the little boxes being uncoated...like sweet tarts.  this bulk candy has a candy shell...like sprees...but is DEFINITELY cry baby sour on the inside!  with the candy coating i actually like this bulk packaged candy even better.  it arrived quickly and well-wrapped in a plastic bag and bubble envelope.  i will be buying again after about 4.5 more pounds...if my taste buds survive!!!
"Product came early. The candy was just as sour as I remember. If you love sour candy this is the stuff for you, there is nothing else I have found for sour power that matches up to these little tear drops."
"This candy is extremely sour and not for the faint of heart! My partner can only eat one or two at a time, but I love them and can eat handfuls. I have been looking for a candy which is sour enough for my extreme fancy and this is it. I stocked up on these just for myself so I can carry them around like mints."
"I was originally drawn to these bc I am vegan (my two dogs are not).  But I like the idea of at least having vegan treats for them.  My two freak out over these! One of my dogs is generally very timid, but when he hears the crinkle of this bag he get's so excited and his little eyes light up like he's a kid on christmas.  it's so cute.  A little pricey but worth it.  Also the 'fries' are long.  The first time we were running low I thought to get out the scissors and make 1 treat into two or three.  They are still a decent sized when cut.  I bet you could train your dog to wash dishes with these promise of one of these treats."
"I have a dog with severe allergies.  what a pleasure to be able to buy healthy treats...which she loves.  Delivered promptly.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KNASEO"">Beefeaters Sweet Potato Chips, 2 Pound Bag</a>"
"I read ingredients SO carefully. In my local pet store I decided to get my boys something different and bought them this treat. Checked the ingredients and they seemed fine. Brand is ""Beefeaters USA"". After a few weeks my dog was vomiting, had bloody stool, and drinking a lot of water. Five hundred dollars later after xrays and blood panels he came back cancer-free and with nothing blocking his system.<br /><br />Puzzled, I googled some of the brands of treats I was feeding them, and information on the organic dog food I feed them. Beefeaters is made in China AND is on the list of tainted dog treats. Thinking it was only chicken jerky I did not think to check.<br /><br />I learned the hard way. I will now either make their treats or make sure it is safe before buying."
"These treats are perfect for dogs who suffer from grain allergies.  My dogs are a bit picky, but are always willing to eat these treats."
"My dog absolutely LOVES these things. I tried to switch brands and I bought one that was made in USA (bc of what i've heard about made in China products), but he wouldn't touch them. lol.<br /><br />I ended up buying the big ole bag of these. He is a very happy doggie right now. lol. Delivery was quick. Also, I didn't realize how much money I was dishing out for the extra small bag. It pays to buy big."
"I totally agree with abbypomeroy. These are long fries. What I do is I cut these in half and stuff it in a kong toy. He acts like it's christmas every time I give it to him. Eyes light up and he sweep my floors with his tail. For $12/2 lb bag, this is a good buy. I have to have these in stock at all times. He craves for these."
"My babies love these sweet potato treats, but $13 a pound is a little over the top. I thought I was getting the big jar AND the 2 pound bag for $26. I nearly fainted."
Several veterinarians have reported cases where dogs have developed symptoms of kidney failure (Fanconi's syndrome) similar to dogs who have been poisoned by Chinese-made chicken jerky treats.<br /><br />The brands implicated include:<br /><br />  Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks for Dogs<br /><br />  Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good Dog Treats<br /><br />  Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality
"I have two Shih Tzu dogs, Martini and Mailing.<br />This product is on recall, made in China and tainted. I ordered three 2lb bags,my dogs LOVE this treat (would rather have this than any other treat),but became very ill. A friend called to let me know what she thought was going on and sure enough, that was the problem. Took them off of the treat and it took a week or so for them to start feeling better.<br />I hope that is helps others."
My girls just love these sweet potato fries.  They come running when they see the bag and I tell them here's your goodies.
"I have been taking Sonne's Beet Juice tablets for about a year. I tend to be hypoglycemic, which  beet juice is supposed to help with. I do muscle-testing (Applied Kinesiology)to determine if I should take them and the dosage. Almost always, the results are that I take 2 per meal, 3 meals a day. I do other things, too, to handle the hypoglycemia. At this time, I'm barely aware being hypoglycemic, so I just continue to take the beet juice. Seems to be a successful action and my muscle-testing is telling me that my body likes it. I find them delicious, too!"
"This was a steal on sale, under $1/oz. Not quite what I expected, it was on the mushy side. Not the best for presentation. There is a sticker on the back of the box with a picture that depicts a dry-smoked-looking fillet. This has a texture closer to canned. But that's the only reason it gets 4 stars. It's very tasty, and would probably make a great ingredient (and use the fluid in the pouch), although we ate it straight. In fact, I bought another box while it was still on sale.<br /><br />If you do want decent presentation, slide it out of the pouch carefully onto a platter, drain and blot dry, and preslice with a very sharp knife to minimize serving debacles. Still looks pretty impressive."
"We bought this some time ago when it was on a super-sale here and finally got around to eating it recently.<br />Our expiration date was some time in 2013, so we had plenty of time to consume it after the initial purchase date.<br /><br />It's packaged in a vacuum-sealed gold foil/plastic 'envelope' that comes shipped in a very cool and very real wooden box.<br /><br />The taste was good, but not out of this world. Not overly smokey.  The meat was very moist tender.<br />I probably wouldn't buy it again unless it went on sale."
"I bought this food for my 80lb Staffy Terrier. The food was shipped the same day I bought it and I recieved it within 3 days. The food however did not sit well with my dog, he usually does not have sensitivites to food but this food made him sick. I tried to ease him onto the food over a few days and it did not do much to help he was consistently sick until I changed his food"
"I mix this dog food with Prairie Salmon and they love it.  Their coats are slick and shiny, even this time of year when they tend to get shaggy.  I have dobermans."
"I HAVE HAD MY BLACK LAB ON DIAMOND DOG FOOD SINCE SHE WAS A PUPPY.  THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIETIES FOR YOUR DOG STARTING FROM PUPPY FOOD TO MAINTENANCE.  I HAVE MY LAB ON THE MAINTENANCE FORMULA AS SHE'S 11 YEARS OLD, AND SHE LOVES IT IN ADDITION TO MAKING HER COAT SHINY!"
"I got this for a large American Bulldog.  He likes it and it is good quality at a fair price.  It does have corn in it but at least corn is not the first ingredient.  This is good basic dog food, nothing fancy but it's a bargain and it actually smells like it is edible.  The cheaper dog foods smell vile and toxic, this smells like actual food and the dog likes it and is doing well on it."
Our breeder introduced us to Diamond Adult Maintennance Chicken dog food.  She explained to us that we needed to make sure the protien levels in dog food are not too high as it could result in too fast a growth spurt in our 10 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback.  Also swollen knuckles may occur if too much protien is present.<br /><br />We have been very happy with this product and thankfully Amazon has it with Super saver shipping otherwise we would have to switch since no one in Hawaii is selling Diamond.
"This is by far an ""undiscovered"" kibble for many that are buying over-priced kibble.  Was raised on a ranch & my parents bought this @ the feed store many years ago.  Kept using it for my dogs (typically Dobies) and as always they live a longer, healhty life with lots of energy, shiny coats and enjoy the food.  I have actually tried other, higher priced brands & some dogs got the ""runs"", others threw up, etc.  So back to a tried and true brand they love.  Love the subscribe & save aspect as well."
"Yup, got the rebate coupon so I am happy.<br />It is very rare they would miss testing like that and their source is the main one for most of the brands available so what do you do.  Gosh!<br />Sorry to anyone who did not see the recall.  Get info by googling maybe."
"Bag arrived torn, with partial contents missing.  Not sure if shipped in damaged condition, or damaged en route.  Would you buy or eat food shipped in an open container?  I won't (due to possible contamination) ... & won't feed ""suspect"" food to my dogs, either.<br />UPDATE: I'm delighted to report that Amazon.com resolved this issue to my satisfaction!  I am, once again, a fan!"
"I just came on to re-order this item for my dog, and it seems that this vendor has doubled the price! Really?"
"Just purchased 40 lbs. of this product, and less than a week later, found out via another company that this food is recalled, if the product code on your bag states best used between 12/09/12 and 04/07/13 and there is either a 2 or 3 in the ninth position of the product code number and an X in the tenth position, then your food is recalled. . Different brand names are involved for both cats and dogs. Both my dog and cats turned up their noses to this food, now I know why.  SMART......... animals. Supposidly dry food only is involved in this recall. Possible Salmonella problem.<br /><br />See www.diamondpetrecall.com  for more info. on other brands involved."
"Chicken by-product meal, is crap and if you feed your dog this you don't care about your dog.Upgrade to the Lamb and Rice Naturals from the same company, Or Chicken and Rice. They are 4 star rated by DOGFOODADVISORS.COM"
Being able to purchase a 50# bag of dogfood from Amazon is worth it's weight in gold.  Not having to lug it out of the store it great!  The bag was in perfect condition when it got to us.
"LOVE THIS TEA. I DRINK IT ALL YEAR LONG, NOT JUST AT HOLIDAY TIME. LOVE THE FLAVOR. I ORDER ENOUGH TO LAST ALL YEAR AS IT IS  ONLY  AVAILABLE AT THE HOLIDAY TIME. HARD TO FIND TOO IN MY SHOPPING AREA. THAN YOU AMAZON!!!"
"Love the tea, and I was very happy to find a smallish quantity to get me through the holiday season."
"To me this is the ultimate holiday drink - it smells and tastes rich, almost like a golden fluid, and I swear it feels like velvet going down my throat. I love it to the extent I'm willing to have it transported to Norway. I blame on my friend who introduced me to this lovely spiced tea."
"This is the best tasting tea on the market.  I have turned into a Nutcracker Sweet hoarder as it is only a ""Christmastime Tea"".  Nothing like a great book (purchased through Amazon) a comfy chair and a cup of Nutcracker Sweet to make the world a better place.  Love this tea, worth the effort to hunt it down every year.  Treat yourself, you deserve a great cup of tea!"
"This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so rich and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this ""regular"" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally ""stretch"" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream...."
"I love this tea.  Drink it all year long, not just at holiday time.  It has a sweet nutty vanilla taste and a touch of cinnamon.  Order it by the 6 pack at a good price from Amazon."
"I know my tittle may have made it sound too rich; but, IMOHO, it is just right...DELECTABLE! For those of you who can NOT have sugar, or gluten, I've put the nutritional info below.

"We love this coffee! Nice smooth taste. Just a hint of butter. Very good. If you like toffee, and coffee, you'll love this."
"I bought this for my husband who is a huge toffee/butterscotch fan, but so far I have used most of them myself. The coffee itself is delicious - a rich, medium roast, but the added flavoring makes it a nice treat. You can taste subtle notes of chocolate; however, the primary flavor is a similar to butterscotch. Not necessarily a first thing in the morning kind of coffee, but definitely great as a late morning or afternoon treat."
My son had this coffee at a business and recommended it to me.  It is wonderful with a slightly sweet aftertaste and buttery finish.  Very good any time of the day.
Product was delivered as promised and on-time. Butter Toffee is my wife's favorite and she said they are wonderful. We ordered the Vanilla as well.
"I love Gloria Jeans Butter Toffee K-cups. This is a mild to medium brew with sweet undertones. It is not too strong, not too sweet...just right. I would recommend this coffee to anyone who wants a good medium brewed coffee without that is slightly sweet with no aftertaste."
The flavor of this coffee is rich and creamy. It really does taste like someone melted a piece of toffee in my cup. It naturally very sweet like something they would put whip cream on at Starbucks. I use this as an everyday coffee because I have a large sweet tooth and sometimes a dessert coffee. It also fills my house with the smell of toffee. It is a great way to wake up in the morning.
"Coffee preferences are very personal.  Before Keurig, I recall a lot of debate in a small office, at the salon, etc.  I decided to try the Butter Toffee because of all the great reviews and because I like Butter Toffee-flavored candies.  It smells great but, it tastes a little bitter to me.  My cleaning lady, on the other hand, LOVES it.  She suggested I try it with a little milk or coffee creamer the way she takes it.  I usually drink mine black but, I decided to try it HER way.  A little milk does mellow the taste, making it more like the butter toffee it purports to be."
"I try. Every time I order K-Cups, i try not to order Butter Toffee. ""Kristin, try some variety!"" i say to myself, as I peruse hundreds of K-Cup varieties. Inevitably, though, a case of Butter Toffee ends up in my cart every time.  The flavor is rich, with a smooth aftertaste- and it tastes good black or with cream or flavored coffee creamer. Highly recommended!!"
bought this as a gift to myself! Never saw this flavor before and though i'd give it a try.  Very happy!  really great taste! Sweet and flavorful!
"This flavor has quickly become one of my favorites out of the 10 or so I have tried ever since getting my Keurig 6 months ago.  Not bitter, not too sweet, but the flavor of butter toffee definitely comes thru for me - will definitely re-purchase."
"I'm not big on Gloria Jean coffee but this one it like having dessert in the morning, or whenever you drink it. Personally, I love it when I add Vanilla Soy Milk ... Real Yummy! Try it, I believe you'll enjoy this coffee."
"The soup itself is very good tasting, and I would not hesitate to order it again EXCEPT this is not the first time (including other products) I've received some very dented cans.  What's up with that Amazon?!<br /><br />The first two cans of this soup I've used so far were both more than a little dented, and the second one could really be considered dangerously so since it was very difficult to find a way to get it open (almost gave up on it).<br /><br />Get with it Amazon!  You've got some good products to offer, but it seems a shame that people really might decide it's not worth it to re-order if you keep sending the overabundance of sometimes even dangerously defective dented cans!"
I'm glad it's organic but it's not very thick.  If it had a little more potatoe I would like it alot more.
"I'm surprised this isn't a 5-star...yet! I was quite impressed with this as a canned soup. That fact that it's organic is even better. I love this soup!<br />A side note: I think it's sad someone marks down a product due to their dissatisfaction with Amazon. It's the product we're giving the stars to. By all means, add the comments about Amazon's quality control, but don't deduct stars for the product."
"Ordered the Wolfgang ""Organic Old Fashioned Potato Soup"".  Recieved the ""Hardy Vegetable Soup"".  Now I have to go through the process of exchanging the soup.  Oh well, that's the way it goes.<br />This is very good soup, but I really wanted the potato soup."
"I haven't been able to find (in my area) any stores that carry potato soup that doesn't have some sort of meat product in the ingredients, and that actually taste good.  Wolfgang Puck has an awesome taste compare to others I have had in the past that are can soups.  Whole Foods stop carrying this particular product, so I was glad to see it on Amazon.  First time I had order food from Amazon, and I can see this is not going to be the last time.)"
This potato soup remined me of the potato soup my mother used to make us while she was still alive.  I grew up on this and it is delicious.
"Wonderful, thick, hearty potato soup. This soup is very tasty and filling, with vegetables and large chunks of potatoes.<br /><br />While the sodium is 850mg per serving, the soup is not salty tasting like many other soups that I've eaten.<br /><br />I ordered 24 cans. They arrived in perfect condition. One of the cans did have a bit thinner mixture than the others, but the taste was still great."
I ran across Kookaburra Australian licorice in a candy store on the South Jersey shore a few years ago and have been eating it ever since.  It leaves other kinds of black licorice in the dust.<br /><br />Try it.  It is so totally worth it.
"I honestly don't think there is another dressing out there as healthy AND tasty as this one - I have been buying it for several years now and can truly say that I am addicted to the amazing taste. SOOOO good!!! No sacrificing taste for healthy ingredients here! I cracked up at the other reviewers' comments about drinking whatever was left after finishing off the salad since I thought I was the only one. And how can you go wrong with these ingredients: Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Bragg Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, purified water, organic honey, organic garlic, Bragg Liquid Aminos, organic onion, organic black pepper, natural xanthan gum. The only item on the list I am not crazy about it Xanthan Gum due to its frequent association with corn, a universally mold-contaminated crop, and some controversial reports (not all Xanthan Gum is made from corn, but as a fermented additive I would not be excited if I learned that Bragg's uses the corn version). Fortunately it is the last (meaning least amount used) ingredient on the list. But overall, I LOVE this product and even with the one possble weak link, still think it it WAAAY better than anything else out there (other than making your own, which I used to do before I fell in love with this ;-)."
"Today I purchased this product at my local health food store (which, BTW, is not any bargain hunter's dream).  When I tried the dressing, I enjoyed the taste, as well as its nutritive qualities.  Consequently, I came to Amazon hoping to not only find it, but at a more competitive price.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  My local store's normal price is $4.99.  Howver, a (regular monthly) 10% off everything sale was happening today. Factor in local sales tax of 5%.  Considering all of that, my final price was still under five dollars.  Compare this to the current Amazon price of $8.99.  Of course I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Earlier comments about a high shipping price for this item seem to no longer apply, because the product is now shipped free with any $25 order--a policy I always look for!  If Amazon could arrange a more competitive price for this item (perhaps by selling it in six-packs???), then I'd consider purchasing this excellent dressing from Amazon.  Please reconfigure your pricing here, Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE 10.26.10<br />Amazon, since I last wrote, you've reduced the per/bottle price to $5.49.  I'm glad to see you're apparently responsive to feedback!<br />This new price is no steal, but at least it's somewhat comparable to other retailers.  (Yet, I look to Amazon for super bargains, and not so much for ""regular"" prices.)<br />For example, above I referenced a local health food store whose every day price for this product is $4.99/bottle.  For the month of October, however, that same store has this product on sale for $3.99/bottle.  I figure there's sufficient profit margin to permit a month-long temporary mark down like that.<br />Hence, I repeat: Amazon, consider selling this awesome dressing in 4-packs or 6-packs (or any combination which drops the per/bottle price below $5.49).  In view of your staggering sales volumn, it seems kinda likely that you could arrange a price that beats the every day price of my local health store.<br /><br />To anyone who hasn't tried this yet, sample it!  It's a good risk because you'll likely find it to be very flavorful.  It's healthful, also.  I enjoy it so much that I tend to pour it on all kinds of foods now, in addition to salad.  (If you try it, you'll see what I mean.)"
"I haven't written a review in a long time, but I had to review this. This stuff is GREAT!!!! I am normally a sweet dressing person, I actually bought this for my husband who loves oil and vinegar. He thought this was great so I decided to try it. Wow was I surprised!!!!! This dressing is very tasty, perfect blend of flavors! I too drink what is left after my salad is gone...it is that good!"
"i read a negative comment on this dressing and had to counter--best vinaigrette on the market! NO SODIUM! yay! all natural ingredients, i REALLY love the taste of salt, so i find that sometimes, i put a dab or two of the bragg aminos when preparing salad. dont put it in the fridge because it will solidify lol, i learned the hard way, but hey, its habit. hard to find locally. so im forced to order online, cant take another day with inferior vinaigrettes... :-("
"Am i nuts or is this price on Amazon way too high, particularly with shipping...<br /><br />Awesome dressing, my wife loves this stuff and then drinks the dressing from the bottom of her bowl.  but shop around for price."
"I have never liked a vinegar and oil type dressing before. And to have it made from organic, good for you ingredients is just a huge bonus. It is really helping me with weight loss. I look forward to my two salads a day!"
This dressing is so good and good for you! My children ages 3 and 5 also love it. I also use this on veggie sandwiches instead of mayo.
"Was so anxious to try this product, wanted to find a super healthy dressing, thought this was it, BOY was I wrong, this is the worst dressing ever, YUCK :("
Tasted horrible . It made me want to puke. Totally riuned my salad. What a waste.I cant believe I wasted my money on this and none of my friends that tried it liked it either.
"My son looooves this stuff, but at $6 for a few ounces of snacks, we won't be getting it again.  Well, maybe on his birthday."
"I gave this to my Dad who had just returned from a trip to Turkey, along with a Turkish cookbook.  He's enjoyed both as reminders of his amazing trip."
"Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say ""man I can sure go for some raman"", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars."
"Love this deal...my wholesale club no longer carries honey roasted peanuts and this is a much better price than any of the other stores. They were packed well, received very quickly and very fresh."
"Good quality product.  What is missing is the honey roasted flavor.  They are not as dry as dry roasted, but they don't have the hint of sweetness one would expected of a honey roasted product."
With Planters you know exactly what you are getting and these are no exception. Good flavor..and trust me..they will be gone sooner than you expect...highly addictive.
"Enjoy the size of jars..works well for parties.  The peanuts are alittle less ""honeyed"" than I expected..taste good.  Nice treat for the lunch bag!"
"Boy, are these great!  They are especially nice if you have children since they're very easy to chew and they don't rip the inside of your mouth.  They have a wonderful butter taste and quite frankly, ever since I've tried these, I don't buy anything else!  Highly recommend!"
"From the moment I tasted these delicious, fat-free pretzels, the excellent butter flavor spoiled me for all other pretzels. The snaps are bite size, and only 5 calories per pretzel. I like them with or without dips, and I often eat them instead of crackers with soup. They also have plenty of snap when you are craving a crunchy snack.<br /><br />Warning: The butter flavor snaps are a bit pricey compared to regular snap pretzels. You pay a premium for the extra seasoning."
"very disappointed, received product with expired sell by date - now I have 12 bags of stale pretzels"
"This product is simply outstanding. I purchased it as I have been informed by my physician<br />to reduce my intake of salt. My experience with Seasonello Herbal accomplishes that goal.<br />Soups, stews, salads, meat dishes, and even Popcorn are all enhanced using Seasonello. The salt reduction<br />is cut at least  50% a goal worthy of achieving for those who need to restrict their diet.<br />Give it a try I am convinced that you will not regret this choice.<br /><br />Norman G. Walker"
"When you first open a jar, you think you are in a spa with the herb mix and it smells so good! It also tastes wonderful! I use it on everything from meats to risotto to salads. I suggest that after you use a little bit, to shake it before you use it so that the mix stays mixed as after a while the lighter herbs and pepper can sink to the bottom and the end of the bottle can be a bit heavy on only certain things but to do a little shake simply restores the mix. I have gone through many bottles since my cousin turned me on to this and given many for gifts! It is really wonderful and my go-to jar so it sits on the counter with at least one in reserve (sometimes several as I give them away)."
"Go get a 2 inch thick cut, rib eye, or whatever your favorite cut is, shake on liberally - coat both sides to create a nice crust.<br /><br />I also use it on grilled vegetables like asparagus, peppers, mushrooms, etc."
This salt is terrific!  Just the perfect amounts and types of seasonings to enhance practically anything on the dinner menu.
"I don't know how these things work. Black magic?<br />Just add water, microwave for 45 seconds, and out comes a cookie. No idea how that works, any cookies or brownies I've made need milk, oil, eggs, SOMETHING.<br /><br />Regardless, it works well. Tastes pretty darn good, too. It's more of a cake type of a cookie than a real cookie but it still tastes good which is the main point, right?<br /><br />As a note, don't over microwave these because the plastic will melt and the cookie will burn."
"After seeing these quick, single-portion snacks in the market I decided to order a large package to keep them in the pantry to satisfy those sweet-treat cravings.  The product is disappointing in both it's size and quality.  A slightly more generous portion would help to satisfy the late night snack urge; the quality is okay.  I ultimately decided not to keep these in stock in the pantry - they don't quite hit the mark."
It taste like a warm soft chocolate chip cookie and the extra fudge made it heavenly! I even poured some caramel on just to make it extra decadent! So delicious!!!
"We love Warm Delights. They are individual desserts but we usually split one between us. It makes just enough to eat and since none is left over, no over indulging. Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too."
"The portion was small, did not fill the bowl, and did not taste very good.  Not worth the money in my opinion."
"I received this dessert as part of a free box of groceries sent to me by Amazon to introduce their new grocery store. I had not tried this product before, and wouldn't have picked it up in the store. A quickie microwave dessert didn't sound that appetizing at first.<br /><br />Was I ever surprised! This dessert is indeed a warm delight, and tastes as luscious as any fudgy chocolate chip cookie dessert with drizzled topping that I've ever gotten in a restaurant. It was instant gratification, too, rather than the cumbersome mix-and-bake time of a conventional Betty Crocker mix. Stir it up, nuke it for a few seconds, and eat!<br /><br />I tried this on a day when I was sick and wanted a treat, but was definitely NOT up to cooking. This is definitely a quick, convenient, tasty treat. I plan to buy more for lunches - a quick, freshly baked dessert at work is a wonderful concept. A young person could also mix it up quickly without having to bother mom, since it's complete with bowl.<br /><br />Very economical, easy, tasty way to prepare a quick dessert. Can't wait to try the other flavors."
"I have to say that to me and my family all of the Betty Crocker's Warm Delights are delicious and this one is too. It definitely tastes like a chocolate chip cookie but with a richer flavor.  It's quick, easy to make and tasty.  A great snack for young and old. Delicious! Give it a try."
I thought this would be a lot better than it turned out to be very small portion and it does not look as good as how it is shown in the picture..it was okay not great
"Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog:<br />[...]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Ancient Organics Ghee is my #1 pick.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation is not gourmet cooking. It is optimum health. Therefore, I am concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Ancient Organics as the very best ghee. It is #1. It is the healthiest product as well as the best tasting. The ghee is so good it is almost magical."
"For over 10 years, I have made my own ghee, tried various brands and nothing compares to this uniquely produced and amazingly flavored ghee.  Because they are a smaller creamery, they do charge more and it is so well worth the price.  We did some research and found out that ghee has a huge health benefit of unclogging vessels in the body rather than clogging them like butter can (and other articles and reports such as [...], said it is casein free and yet others said it is lactose free too)...so, that's the logical side for using it-but with this ghee, the TASTE is so incredibly DELICIOUS, that our family can't even consider butter or margarine now.  Ghee stays soft and does not have to be refrigerated. The shipping is reasonable through Amazon, especially so you can try it in the smaller size.  The main point is that it seems that through working with nature's cycles combined  with their loving attention to the welfare of their cows, they have captured the secret to a wonderful tasting and ultimately health sustaining product."
"If you love a rich butter flavor, this is THE Ghee for you. Made from [...] butter, the best dairy on earth, This concentrates the flavor so a little equals huge butter flavor. No refrigeration needed, perfect for frying, grilling, baking, freezing, any time you would use butter but would love to really enjoy the buttery taste, Please try Ancient Organic Ghee! Eggs, Popcorn, Shortbread, Lobster, Tortillas, Baked Potato, Veggies.....What do you like with butter?"
"I am very sensitive and observant to everything I eat and I am a very picky eater. I bought Ghee to practice spirituality better because Ghee is divine.<br /><br />In Bhagavad Gita it says, ""The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.""<br /><br />Control of the taste buds and rising above favoritism of foods and hence emotions and life situations to seek Bliss is easier when using Ghee. Ghee imparts a love-like feeling to each morsel of food you put on the tongue, the inherent taste of the food substance is amplified by the divine feeling of Ghee. But the taste buds do not retain the taste because Ghee renders them unable to do so. So if you are Blissful spiritual seeker and eat a savory meal with Ghee, you are able to hold onto this bliss feeling undisturbed after meal.<br /><br />Ancient organics Ghee scores at the top, in fact it is the only Ghee out of top three in Amazon to have this love-like quality in it. I am thinking its because of the Vedic way in which it is prepared while Mantras are being chanted. Even the bottle label has  Mahamritunjaya mantra and Gayatri Mantra written on it. It has a great smell that reminds you of pure love and the taste is not so strong, feels just right. It is easily assimilated into body and it does not feel like I just ate a spoon full of lard. The other two Ghees ""Purity Farm"" and ""Grassfed Organic"" caused a heavy bloated feeling especially in the heart area like whatever fat I just ate got deposited there instantly. If you are serious about getting Ghee for health only buy Ancient Organics. I went to their site and bought the 32 Oz jar for $47 shipping included and I think using a teaspoon everyday it will last me two months minimum."
"I have been trying the some of the numerous Ghee's that are available on Amazon and Ancient Organics Ghee is by far and away the best flavor, consistently good quality of all the others that I have tried. Most other Ghee's are very strong in flavor almost like the phony butter oil that you use on popcorn. Ancient Organics is not the cheapest, but it is the best. Ghee can be used in anything that requires butter. It does not contain salt. I use it on garlic bread, saut&eacute;ing  vegetables, frying eggs, etc. Since it is clarified butter, you find that you do not need as much when you use it. A little bit goes a long way."
Rich and flavorful - when i first opened my Jar of organic ghee i couldn't' believe how sweet it tasted. turns out the sugars in  the milk caramelize when heated during the manufacturing process. So it smells great and tastes great and has all the goodness of Strauss organic milk. Note for people allergic to dairy - Ghee has no milk proteins in it - just the pure fat so many people who are sensitive to dairy can tolerate ghee just fine.<br /><br />I look forward to trying out their flavored ghee products too.
"This is my first time using ghee. It was very good, but I notice that my jar had a lot of air pockets which appeared to have less product. Because of the expense of the product I will try another product."
"I absolutely love this brand of Ghee butter. It is so smooth and healthy and tasty. The lunar method of how Ancient Organics produces this product is very interesting and I believe it adds to the positive healthy energy this butter gives me. Having high cholestrol myself, I feel good about using this healthy butter.It is fantastic on popcorn!"
"Even my mom could never make such awesome Ghee.<br />If you like Ghee you will love this one !!<br />It is pure, delicious and tasty."
"I have had the same jar for 1 1/2 years, and its still good. Just as good as the day I bought it. I love this stuff, so much better (taste and health) than butter. It is light and sweet. Ancient Organics is the best, top-quality!  This company pours love into everything they do and you can tell. This is the best Ghee anywhere! I will only buy Ancient Organics brand Ghee. It seems a little expensive but its worth it plus you only need a little. A jar will last a long time."
"I keep this very handy, enjoy using it,<br />and will definitely get more.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026LNGTS"">Organic Ghee</a><br /><br />I will also get the ""Grass Fed Organic Ghee.""<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032RPLSY"">Grassfed Organic Ghee 7.8 Oz</a>"
"Recently I was trying to find and taste the BEST sardine that is available in the market and came across a list of sardines that a person had tried.  He rated this sardine as the number 1 sardine in his list.<br /><br />After paying a fortune specially on shipping in getting this sardine, I could not wait to taste it.  I met my first obstacle when trying to open it.  It comes with a pull ring and you have to pull the metal cover off the can by pulling the ring.  It was very risky because it was hard to pull it and I almost cut myself.  Some manufacturers of sardine like Seasons had already changed the top part of their sardine can from metal to foil paper (sold in Costco) so that they could be easily opened.<br /><br />Once I opened the can (not completely), I found a few skinless and boneless sardines that were packed separately inside the can.  There were so few of them (like 4 or 5) and they were so tiny and there was simply more olive oil than sardines.  It almost seems like they are swimming inside the can.<br /><br />Well, I took a bit of them.  Not bad but not that great either.  Beside the fact that I can remove them easily (they are so far apart from each other), their tastes are not any different than the much cheaper Seasons sardines I got from Costco.  Only difference is that the Seasons sardines were packed so tightly (you get more sardines though) when I tried to remove them, they all got crushed.<br /><br />I cannot really say this is the best sardine I have ever tried and to pay almost $[...] (after paying shipping) a can for it, I do not believe it is worth the money.  You are better off going to Target or Wal-mart and buy the sardines there.  Costco will be much cheaper also."
"I won't mention any brand names as I don't know the intricacies and implications of what are known as ""food disparagement laws,"" but to say that you could do just as well to buy the tinned fishing bait that sells for $1.19 a can at your local grocery as to buy Angelo Parodi brand is just ludicrous.  Trust me, I have tried dozens of different brands of sardines, and these are just flat-out delicious.  They have a very mild flavor, almost like tuna.  Though your cat will come running when he gets a whiff of these, they are not extremely ""fishy"" like brands of poorer quality.<br /><br />Face it.  If you don't like sardines, you won't like these.  Nor would you like any other brand.  However, if you love sardines and have discriminating tastes, i.e., you know the difference between garbage and a truly fine, gourmet product, then these sardines are the best you are going to find.<br /><br />Still need more convincing?  Go to your preferred search engine and look up ""the great sardine taste-off"" and see which cannery got the honor of best-tasting sardine.  I found them wonderful and delicious, and hope you do too.<br /><br />To make this worth your while by the time you pay shipping, I would order at least 5 cans.  I did.  And I was not sorry.  I've got one can left and I'm leaving it to age in the pantry until the snacking occasion arises when nothing but a truly fine and delicious sardine will fit the bill."
"I am one of those fishermen who like sardines with crackers.  I had read that sardines from the coast of Portugal are among the best, so I gave these a try.  Though pricey, they are good, especially when drained and treated with fresh squeezed lemon and a little salt.  Recommended."
"I tried my first can of these exact sardines (for about half of what it costs here and purchased at a local deli/bakery store) and I found chunks of sardines not exactly ""packed like sardines"".  These sardines got first class tickets apparently, so they had plenty of room.  Nothing wrong with the taste, but I've had as good or better for less where the can was genuinely packed-to-the-gills with fish."
"I read about these sardines on a food site where someone had posted a list of 54 sardine varieties he had sampled and said this one was the best. I decided to give this brand and variety a try. The shipping is high but not if you order a bunch of cans at once, which is what I did (ordered 10, shipping was the same as for 1). I've eaten several cans already and they are indeed delicious. Very nice on a cucumber and sweet pepper salad, using the olive oil for part of the dressing. Next time I will buy 20 cans."
"The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.<br /><br />I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own."
"We like this soup because it is low sodium and uses sea salt. My husband adds more salt, I do not.  I use 1/2-3/4 can of water when preparing and that seems to give it additional flavor."
"This is simply the best frozen chicken tikka masala I've found--far better than Ethnic Gourmet or other competing brands.  I eat this at least once a week.  The creamy sauce is great with rice, the chicken is juicy, and the spicing is just right.  Most Indian restaurants don't even produce as good a chicken tikka masala as this one."
"This tastes even better than the ""Butter Chicken"" you find at Indian restaurants, because it's not as greasy.  Actually, the delicious tomato-cream sauce makes this meal very addictive.  A reasonable portion size also."
"Despite the odd message about the product being changed to little 9oz boxes which include rice, my latest batch is the regular 10oz sauce-n-meat, sans rice, as advertised.<br /><br />It loses 1 star because the chicken doesn't exactly come across as chicken tikka. Anyone that's had this in a restaurant will know it normally has a yummy orange colored covering marinaded a few mm into the meat, whereas this is just a basic roasted/marinaded chicken. It's not horrible by any means, but having had this dish way too many times for good health, both sides of the Atlantic, you may be a little disappointed if that's what you're expecting.<br /><br />You can enhance the sauce by adding more cilantro and a teaspoon of chili-powder.<br /><br />Something that was rather disconcerting with my latest batch was 11 out of 12 boxes were opened! The sauce trays were fine, but you have to wonder why all the packets were open.<br /><br />In summary, these are the best frozen (or jar) Indian dinners I've ever had. Not restaurant standard, but definitely not the bland, over salted slop you'd normally from this kind of product. I think I'll be getting these on a very regular bases. It would be jolly nice if they give the chicken the real tikka treatment.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-04-13:<br /><br />I'm now through 4 orders of this, or maybe it's 5. The product has been pretty consistent taste-wise, but it feels like the later batches had smaller or less chicken than the early ones. Without direct comparisons, it's hard to be precise, but my gut is telling me there has been a reduction of chicken.<br /><br />I still get a few sauce trays that are not completely sealed, but the dry ice in the shipping packaging has kept things nice and solid.<br /><br />My two local restaurants have taken quite a dive in quality over the last year, so much so, I've given up on them. I wish Tandoor Chef had a greater variety of these available sans-rice, and maybe a combo-pack. As much as I love tikka masala, it would be rather nice to have a madras or vindaloo available.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is that my son enjoys the packaging's dry-ice, which we dump in water. A little bonus :D<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-05-29:<br /><br />It turns out I've ordered these 8 times now, so I've bumped it up to 5 stars! The last batch felt like it had a little more meat than the previous two order too.<br /><br />These aren't always available either. So if you're tempted, you'll need to get them when you see them. They could unavailable for a few weeks when you come back."
"These meals are really good - not fine dining but we are, after all, talking about a ""tv dinner"" right? In that context this stuff is really good. However, that said, it's high in fat (greasy) and needs rice to go along with it as it is very soupy.  Still, was a nice change from the usual frozen pizza night and enough that (with rice) one meal served the two of us just fine. Highly recommended for the frozen meal eating crowd. Also, we got a whole bunch of them and they arrived in good condition, completely frozen - so no worries on that front."
"Tandoor Chef Chicken Tikka Masala is the Best Indian Food and Best Frozen Meal I have ever had! It does not taste like any frozen meal I have had, and it tastes as good, if not better than the local Indian Food eatery. I am so amazed that this is a frozen meal and I am so pleased that Tandoor Chef is so affordable. Also, Tandoor Chef does not give me any stomach problems, yet most other frozen food makers of all types do. I am blown away how good this stuff tastes, how much it fills me up, and how affordable (and easy!) it is! The chicken is very tender, very juicy and it tastes like someone just spent hours in my kitchen! There is plenty of sauce included in this meal, which is excellent for my rice, etc. Amazon delivery in dry ice and packaging was perfect. I make some rice, veggies and other stuff I like and pour this meal over it; I can eat this every single day. Thank you, Tandoor Chef - for your amazing meals!"
"Seriously, this Tikka Masala is just as good if not better than any of the Indian restaurants in Seattle (I've tried them all). Sauce is perfectly creamy and spicy, and the chicken tastes great. Really impressed with this."
"Was so happy that Amazon carries this product as have a hard time finding in stock at local Indian grocer. Fast and secure  shipping with dry ice by Amazon. Tandoor Chef makes some of the best! , restaurant quality Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce alone is real tasty and can eat alone with naan. The only improvement I wish was that there was more Chicken Pieces as each box has about 4-5 square boneless chicken pieces with plenty of sauce."
"I received the item within 36 hours of placing the order and saw no problems with the dry ice or the packaging. The package was s snug fit and the food items were in perfect condition. Above all else, the food was good to taste!<br />This is perhaps one of the tastiest and most value-for-money deals on Amazon or anywhere else, for that matter, as far as frozen food is concerned. I am definitely planning to get more of these in the future. So, if you are in the mood for some Indian style chicken dish, this is definitely worth a try."
"I'm a big fan of chicken tikka masala, and being far from any restaurants I searched and searched for something I could just reheat and chow down on.  I'd tried the Jyoti and found it tasted much to similar to MREs for my taste.<br />This stuff actually tastes like chicken tikka masala.  It's not perfect, but it's close enough.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with it was the fact that they ship it with dry ice, and when that all evaporated... the boxes got soggy.  Compound this with the fact that the adhesive keeping the plastic covering on the bowl has the strength of watered down elmer's glue... I was in for a nasty mess when I opened the box.  So, out of the 12, I lost about three.<br /><br />I'm sure had I not shipped it all the way out to Iraq, they would have made it frozen and intact.  I'll probably end up buying more of these though."
I highly recommend this product but not from the place I got it<br /><br />I had a sever cases of gastroenteritis after i used the first packet. I disposed of all the remaining packets following that
"Excellent taste, etc...simply delicious.  Highly recommend, but be forewarned, the sauce is addictive.  For the convenience, this is the best."
"I will start by saying I did not by this on Amazon so I cannot speak to this seller.<br /><br />I can say that the product as a whole is very good.  I buy the chicken with rice from my local grocery store and have been very impressed with it.  It is remarkably better than competing brands.<br /><br />I would prefer if the serving was larger, but am not certain I'd buy the box of only chicken without rice.  The reason for that being that I want to throw something in the microwave and make a meal.  I don't want to have to make my own rice or other side.  That being said, it's not like the chicken and rice is a small serving.<br /><br />Perhaps that just speaks to how mch I like the product.  My only ""complaint"" is that I want more of it per box."
"I was a bit unsure about the product from some of the reviews, which mentioned a lower quality rice included version.  Rest assured, this is the original one without rice.  I was astounded and extremely pleased with the shipping speed from this seller.  I ordered mid-day Thursday (and marked ""Super Saver Shipping"" as they instruct for expedited shipping) and received the product on mid-day Friday (21 hours later!) even though Amazon had quoted an expected delivery the following Tuesday.  Signature was not required for delivery, which is good for people without that flexibility.  There was a very small amount of dry ice left in the package, and all contents were cold.  Considering free overnight shipping, the price for this is really low.  Great value for a product that is almost impossible to find/replicate (near restaurant- quality frozen Tikka Masala)."
"This stuff is great.....I was surprised by the strong flavors and the great smell that was coming out of the microwave, I felt like I had just spent hours prepairing this meal!<br /><br />Any who let me get to the point, this price is ridiculous I would never pay this amount of money for frozen food period point blank( It would be cheaper getting your own ingredients and making it your self...which I think I'm going to do) i paid $2.29 for one 7ounce box, therefore I can buy 24 boxes for the same price that your asking for (ridiculous). I think I'll stick to my dollar store in Brooklyn."
"I was sick of everything offered in my local stores so I thought that Amazon might have something new for me to try. Buying over $50 of something I hadn't tried was risky, but it paid off. My whole family loves it! It has just the right amount of spiciness, it is rich but not oily, and the chicken is cooked perfectly. The fact that each box feeds two (or one VERY hungry person) means it is even a great value. Now I'm going to have to go eat some. Yum."
"Love this stuff!  After moving to a new town we were missing our old Curry place.  After a few tries at local restaurants we were unfortunately unable to find a suitable replacement.  So we gave these a shot, and it was as good as some of the other reviews.  I am impressed with how velvety and creamy the sauce is despite being warmed up in a microwave.  The flavor is intense, however given that we're used to ""British"" levels of heat the dish is a bit on the mild side.  However, with a little addition of Garam Masala and  a few chili flakes you can adjust the heat of the dish without messing up the subtle layers of flavor. In addition, quite a money saver given that you get 5-6 meals for about the same price as a night out for curry.<br /><br />Almost forgot, with the extra sauce and some sauteed potatoes you can make a great ""Aloo Tikka Masala""."
"First of all, I'd like to note I did get the item described. There was no rice in my frozen dinners. I read some of the other reviews and was a little concerned, but it turned out okay.<br /><br />Shipping evaluation: I was hesitant to buy this item because frozen foods can be tricky when shipped. It gets very hot here in the summer, 90+ degrees is typical in the months of June through August, and is not unusual in May to get above 90. It had been in the mid nineties when I ordered this, so I made sure to be here when it was due to arrive. It didn't ship right away, but once I got the shipment notification it was here the next day. It ships in an insulated Styrofoam container with dry ice. It was quite frozen when I fetched it off my porch, but I picked it up within minutes of it's arrival. I can't say how it would have stood up on a 95 degree day for more than 7 hours out there, but grabbing it right away kept it nice and cold. I wouldn't worry about that at all during the Fall, Winter and early Spring months. Very nicely packed, and once shipped, very speedy.<br /><br />Meal evaluation: I used to live in the Detroit area and had many options for Indian food both in restaurants and shopping. Of the prepackaged stuff that requires no cooking, this is one of the best. The flavors are right, and the meat is generally good. In this one, the chicken for the most part is nice white pieces of meat. I've only ever had one of these that has a fattier dark piece of meat in it, and I've eaten quite a few over the years. Some people would say it's better than restaurants, I would say it's the best non-restaurant Indian I've eaten. I've had a dish called Butter Chicken that is similar to this tikka. Some of the tikkas I've had were a bit heavier on the spices, and this is actually fairly mild spice-wise. It is definitely enough for two people for dinner, and is not too bad calorie-wise. I've had it both on plain rice and Basmati rice. It really is better on the Basmati rice, as that rice cooks a little dryer and has a more complimentary flavor.<br /><br />Price Evaluation: I've purchased this at several places. Unless you are lucky enough to live near a discount ethnic food place like a Global Foods Market or a Trader Joe's, this price ($4.75 a dinner) is actually pretty good. I've been to Indian grocers that charge more than this, and in the ethnic food isles at the general grocery store it tends to be about 10-20% more than this price. So it's definitely worth it if you don't mind 12 boxes taking up your freezer space."
"Add with some basmati rice and possibly some naan and you've got a quick, killer meal! I order this and constantly found myself craving it for dinner again and again."
"I'm not indian and i don't play one on tv. :-)  But I have to say the brand ""Tandoor Chef"", especially their chicken and lamb dishes, are soooo out of this world as close to what you'll get to actually eating at a real indian restaurant.  I LOVE indian food and have eaten at many indian restaurants and bought many brands of indian ready to eat meals in Indian groceries and Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and my local Safeway supermarket but one day I went into this small Indian grocery store which had just recently opened up in the city and they sold ""Tandoor Chef"" frozen foods which I never tried before so I tried a few of their dishes.<br /><br />I'm used to tame indian frozen foods at Trader Joe's and by Amy's, etc., but when I compared Tandoor Chef's frozen dishes to theirs, they seemed like PALE americanized versions compared to the REAL spiciness, savory sauciness of Tandoor Chef.  Tandoor Chef gives you more than enough chicken or lamb for the relatively small price you're paying, too in comparison to most other frozen indian food versions currently in mainstream markets.  Buy some garlic naan (indian flatbread) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GP405S"">Tandoor Chef Garlic Naan, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> along with it and finish off the sauce by soaking your naan (like dipping bread in clam chowder) in the spicy sauce for a complete meal.  And don't forget you need to cool your fiery palate down with each hot bite with a cool raita made of sour cream (or yogurt) with sliced cucumbers.  I usually also add loose leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and small thin slivered carrot bits to my raita, sort of like a salad. Instead of dessert, finish your meal down while cooling down your palate with the smooth refreshing indian yogurt mango smoothie-like drink while eating your meal with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J1B136"">Rasna Lassi Mix Mango</a>  or  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XHFG70"">Rellure Kesar Mango Pulp, 30-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>  which is a lot more cooling than drinking iced water or other cold drink.<br /><br />Tandoor Chef's dishes are a delight to eat that you shouldn't pass up if you really love indian food or you love spicy food AND you don't have the time/money to go to a real indian restaurant.<br /><br />Their ""Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZKCQL2"">Tandoor Chef Masala Dosa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> is also good, not as main meals but as appetizers or light brunch break snacks."
"I'm a really harsh critic when it comes to frozen indian food as I am Indian and have tasted numerous restaurant, home cooked, and frozen indian dishes for the majority of my life.  I've been to convenience stores, all the trader joes safeways and lucky's as a college student trying to get a good affordable and tasty indian frozen dish and they've all been rubbish so far.  I decided to give this one a try and its the best indian frozen food I've had hands down.  Obviously it can't compare to tikka masala cooked from scratch, but I find it a real pain to cook indian dishes from scratch on a college schedule on a college budget.  Get this! It's worth it."
"Apparently, I didn't have the correct information. As I have learned from Tandoor Chef, the version without rice is still available and I just ordered a 12-pack. So I am revising my original post and upgrading it from 1 to 5 stars. This is a great tasting meal with a fair price.<br /><br />Tandoor Chef - thumbs up!<br /><br />-----<br />Previous review deleted"
"I have tried many different Indian food TV dinners before and hated every single one of them.  For some reason they never tasted authtentic but Tandoor Chef is awesome I've had the Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Naan.  All amazing!"
My favorite of all Indian dishes is Chicken Tikka Masala. This by far has to be the best frozen Chicken Tikka Masala that I have tried. I will certainly get this food item many times over.
They arrived within 2 days in perfect and well protected foam box with dry ice in it.<br />This Tandoor Chicken Tikka Masala is very tasty. I will surely buy them again and again!
"I bought this at my local grocery store that sold $2 more from what Amazon is selling so I decided to do my Chicken Tikka Masala shopping here on Amazon instead.<br />This product is so goooood its better than sex, lol.<br />My friends and I were eating this and we coulnt get over how amazing it tasted, even if you are full you just wanna have more.<br />If you haven't had Indian food before then you MUST try this, I can guarantee you will love it.<br />The spicing is JUST right, not too much salt and not too much pepper!"
"My whole family loves this and has been eating it for years. However, Tandoor Chef has now added rice to it (actually, half rice and half chicken which is not what the box shows you) and still charging the same price! What a rip off. I don't want rice with it, I want to eat it with Naan. And if they are going to reduce the chicken by half, shouldn't the price come down because really, how expensive is rice compared to chicken!? I am now looking at other brands because it is now too expensive to eat this on a regular basis. Shame on you Tandoor Chef.<br /><br />(The picture that is shown at this link, and the product description does not say it has rice. I wonder how accurate it is because I have not been able to find this at any of the stores. I can only hope Tandoor Chef will revert to just the Chicken Tikka Masala with NO rice.)"
"Ok, this isn't amazing restaurant style quality. However, it's pretty darn tasty and exactly what you were hoping to taste (at least think about tasting) as you eye the box nervously. Again, not super amazing taking the place of restaurant/fresh cooked by grandma quality, but that's like expecting a frozen hungry man to beat out fresh KFC (not gonna happen, and that's through no fault of Hungry Man!). So for what it is (as opposed to what it's not), 5 stars. If you happen to get the style with rice, if you mix them together it's fine. Really wish naan was included though."
"I have been a HUGE fan of this product for a long time, but now, in the version at grocer's freezer they cut the portion in HALF and add some cruddy rice and charge the same price!!! I complained to the company and they responded that ""a lot of consumers asked that we add rice"" (yeah... sure they did. They just wanted to improve their profit margin so they cut the portion in half) I can't order a CASE of this stuff, I live in an apt. so I won't be having any more Tandoor Chef :( Greedy so-and-sos!<br /><br />This review is not against AMAZON - no problem with amazon.com but I'm very bummed at Tandoor Chef.<br />(but really, they ship frozen food???)"
I've had chicken tika masala a million times without it ever having nuts in it but this one has cashews in it and since I suffer from nut allergies my body responded with anaphylactic shock causing me to have to go to the hospital.
"When my dog had her teeth professionally cleaned, the vet said we should use Dentastixs to help keep them clean.  When I went to the pet store I was so happy to see there was a natural choice for those of us who are feeding an all natural diet.  My dog loves them and can't wait to get one after every meal.  I am so happy Amazon.com carries them because now I cannot find them in any of the pet stores I shop in."
"My dog has had surgery two years in a row for bladder stones and the only treat she is allowed is the ""natural"" denta stix.  Our local grocery store always carried them but discontinued them.  What was I to do?  Then I thought of Amazon.  Sure enough I was able to order a whole box of them and the icing on the cake was that it was cheaper to do this than buy them individually from the store.  Amazon to the rescue again!"
"This is the most economical way that I have found to buy this product.  They are small, which is good for my dog.  Any treat, bigger than these she feels need to be hidden away for the future. (She's forever worrying if we'll find her ""hidden"" treasures.)  They DO help keep her teeth clean and breath better, (if not minty fresh) She gets 2 - 3 a day.  They are her reward for getting her feet cleaned when she comes in from her walks each day. She knows the drill: leash off, feet wiped down and then Dentastix! Our friends remark at how well trained she is. Truth is that she's smart enough to know how to get her treats from us.  Works every time."
One of the better treats for dogs that is not only a snack they will love but actually cleans their teeth and gums. My pooch was building up serious tarter but once we found Dentastix his teeth and gums made a 99% recovery. I highly recommend this product.
"While I have no personal opinion of these treats, my dog loves them and they really seem to help her ""doggie breath""."
"This is from our dog Sandy-"" Don't get between me and my treat. Mom says it is good for me but I don't care. I just love it."""
Ever since I started giving my 2 lil Maltese males these treats they stopped eating any others. There great treats and they do work at reducing the plaque on their teeth. They get 2-3 of em everyday usually when I'm leaving the house and their very happy. Good product with good results...
"With daily use I have seen an improvement in my dog's dental hygiene. She can be uncooperative when it comes to brushing so Dentastix have come in handy. I enjoy the cleaner teeth, but, as noted in another post, I was concerned about weight gain. Fortunately, I have not seen a problem thus far.<br /><br />These treats also tend to be eaten very quickly due to their soft chewy consistency, also posted about this product. Is this texture critical to the dental cleaning action of the treat or would a longer lasting formula be possible?  This would engage the dog's attention longer and possibly clean better over a longer interval of time.<br /><br />Last, as I echo another post, the treat does little to mitigate halitosis.  Other dental treats claim to be able to do more by including additives, such as enzymatic or flavored ingredients. Do they really work and should Dentastix do the same? On the other hand, brushing never seemed to eliminate the problem for long either.<br /><br />Despite my caveats, Dentastix has improved my dog's oral hygiene significantly and for that I recommend this product."
"I'm sure these are great for other dogs but my dachshunds are garbage disposals and they eat these things in literally less than 30 seconds.  They're too soft; they just bite off chunks and swallow them, which doesn't help their teeth at all. My dad insists on giving them dentastix every day, but their breath is still putrid.  I've heard people complain about the smell but I've never really noticed it.  Anyway it's probably good for dogs that aren't big chewers, but they're not good for my dogs."
"Dogs love them which makes me happy.  I ran out!  I need to order more.  They are getting older and starting to show problems with their teeth, i.e. loose teeth, gingivitis, bad breath, plaque and tartar.  This product seems to help and they certainly enjoy chomping on them and often look for more!  Good stuff!!"
This coffee tastes great in the morning.  It is an excellent value and highly recommended for all decaf coffee lovers. The price is right.
"Alto Grande coffee is served at my layover hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  I always look forward to drinking it while in San Juan.  I have purchased the 5 lb. bag of whole been Super Premium Alto Grande coffee several times and find it is well worth every penny.  If you are a serious coffee lover, this truly is one of the World's best coffees.  It brews a rich yet delicate, smooth and flavorful cup of coffee you'll want to share with your friends and family.  Try it, see why it was once reserved only for The Vatican and royalty."
"This doesn't have the same flavor I remember when I drank these coffees in Hawai'i.  The packaging changed and apparently, so did the formula.  It tastes so-so.  For me, it tastes like a diluted version of the Hawai'i experience. Too bad because this Irish Creme was one of my favorites."
"This is not your average canned tuna at $10.00 a tin, but if you are looking for a gourmet canned tuna experience this is it.  I have seen the same product in Michigan for $17.99 a tin, so $9.99 is quite the bargain.  I made a simple butter lettuce salad, flaked the tuna on top, reserving the olive oil in the tin for the dressing of sea salt, ground pepper, lemon juice and a couple of capers.  It got rave reviews.<br /><br />Ortiz has different grades and Amazon has the best prices, try one of each in a side by side comparison, include a can of the best tuna you can find in your local grocery store then decide for yourself.<br /><br />On a side note, has anyone noticed that Amazon's prices are better that eBay prices?"
"Just came back from Spain and was reading The New Spanish Table by Anya von Bremzen. She had a sidebar where she raved about Ventresca Tuna (of course, what she was eating was specially canned for Chef Juan Mari Arzak, the Spanish heavy hitter.) But after she raved on and on, I decided to see what the hoo-ha was about. So I bought a can. And it made just about every other canned tuna I'd ever tasted seem like cat food. This stuff is the real deal."
"Not a fan of capitol punishment? Well, guess what... you'll be standing in line after you taste this velvet tuna belly fillet from pure spanish waters. Your last meal will never be more enjoyed. Even the pope likes it."
"I love tuna so I ordered this caviar of tunas, but was disappointed. It's OK, but not $16-a-can OK. I would have given some to my cat if I had one. Tonnino's better!"
If you can afford to try this even once - then do it!  But I'll guarantee that you'll be ordering again. It's not just that taste that defines the quality of this tuna but its velvety texture as well.  Not for tuna sandwiches! (how dare you even think that!)
This can has a solid piece of tuna as compared with others. The Cento tuna is in pieces as compared with this. I will definitely get this one again.
"my 27lbs beagle/jack russell dog is very picky with her food, doesn't eat any dog threats. when one of the Pet food express staff offered this to my dog. she loves it right from there. i purchased 2.2 lbs for $40. then, i ordered a bigger size here at amazon. i can see the big difference to my dog's body,breath smell,coat/skin. my dog is a lot leaner now. it's expensive but just for that 2.2lbs i have seen tremendous good outcome."
"Came in a ""refrigerated"" polystyrene box with a mini ice pack, quick delivery.<br />The foie gras was good, this is the same as in a French supermarket."
"I love corn nuts. All in all, for a fast snack, you could do a lot worse. The nacho flavored aren't as ""flavorful"" (read - they don't give you bad breath, lol) as the Ranch, though I love the Ranch as well. These make for a wonderful, crunchy, satisfying and relatively healthy snack on the go."
I love the nacho flavor corn nuts.  Cheesy nutty taste!  And the 1.7oz pk is a perfect snacking size.  Would recommend for corn nut lovers.
"I've used this product for years, but it has become impossible to find in stores in my area.  It is very easy to make and turns out moist.  I like it because it only makes an 8"" size cake and with just 2 of us now, it's perfect!  I also like that it uses the pineapple tidbits and not whole slices."
"A great product. I like this better than making a pineapple upside down cake from scratch... my taste buds... agree............<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMM98A"">Betty Crocker Pineapple Upside Down Cake Mix, 21.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>"
I'm sending many thank yous to Amazon.com for having the supply of cake that couldn't be found in upstate NY.<br /><br />Sandi
"My whole family enjoys these mixes and I can't find them in any local store.....easy and good.  They make an 8"" cake which is great for two people."
"This is blasphemy.  It should be made with brown sugar and butter (topping) not their disgusting topping mix containing partially hydrogenated soybean oil, cottonseed oil and corn starch.  The topping was absolutly DISGUSTING.  Not to mention it makes only a very small cake.  I will NEVER EVER EVER buy another Betty Crocker Pineapple upside-down cake mix again. I would have given negative stars but you can't do that.  So for the incompetent people who can't cook or taste anything, this is probably right up your ally."
"works well as i knew it would since i have used many times, it is just hard to find now days and suspect betty crocker has discontinued, hope you have a lot so i can get more"
I thought it was very easy to make.  I prepared it for a group gathering and everyone liked it.
"This is a good product because it's grain free.  One cat has digestive issues and this seemed to help.  very soft consistency as there are no fillers.  My cats prefer pate to chenky food so perhaps the other Natural Balance in other forms will have more body.  My cats clean their plates.  They each get 1/2 can in the morning along with their dry food.  they usually finish most of it right away, and finish later on."
"Our 18 year old cat is on its last legs, but polishes off a can or two per day of the Chicken & Liver Pate (with the few teeth he still has)."
"I bought it some months ago and my cat loves this product.  Any PetCo has it so you don't even need to order it on line.  It's a little pricy but my cat is full of energy and healthy, in the long run I am saving money too."
"I was buying this kind for years locally; usually in larger jars than this (26 oz), for between four-seventy and five-twenty a pop. I would only buy the smaller jars if they were out of larger ones; the last batch I got was two-fifty a pop (on sale). However, recently this product suddenly disappeared from all stores that used to carry it -- that's why I'm here, looking it up (I don't find the prices here very attractive: they're mostly above what it was locally).<br /><br />Why this butter is good: no evil ingredients. If you take a jar of your typical run-of-the-mill peanut butter and check out the ingredients, you'll see a lot of crap in there, crowned by the biggest nutritional no-no: transfats. This kind here doesn't have any of it: its ingredients are (directly off a jar): peanuts, evaporated cane juice, natural oil blend (palm fruit and flaxseed oils), salt, molasses. As you can see, still it has many additions (cane juice is sugar, I take it), salt, etc. Flaxseed oil is where the ALA (Omega-3 oil) comes from. What palm fruit oil is doing there, I've no idea. Well, as you can see, there are still additions. (Btw, the amount of ALA in a serving of this butter is very low: if you were after ALA, you'd do better by buying flax seeds and grinding them yourself).<br /><br />Now, as far as Omega-3: it's not one kind of fat, it's a family of fats sharing one particular molecular feature: their unsaturated ""moments"" start exactly three molecular links from the end (thus ""omega"", which is the last letter in the Greek alphabet; ""Omega-6"" fats have the unsaturated holes six links from the end, Omega-9, nine links from the end, etc.). Not all Omega-3 fats are equal: what this product has is ALA (extracted from flax), but what you _really_ need is DHA and EPA (who usually come from fish). ALA can be converted to DHA/EPA but the conversion rate is low and affected by many competing metabolical processes in the human body. Iow, consuming ALA isn't really what you need; you need DHA/EPA, so if you're after ""heart-healthy"" Omega-3 polyunsaturated fat acids (PUFA), stick to fish or supplements. Flax/ALA is really of little or no use. I'm saying all of this so that people do not overestimate the importance of this product based on ALA in it. For what it is, realistically, I think it's overpriced.<br /><br />Now, finally, I think the company that makes this thing made a big error allowing the disappearance of this product from stores: we humans are creatures of habit, and like I said, I was buying this product for years w/o thinking why. Making it disappear made me, first, uncomfortable; then it made me go around looking for it; then it made me look for replacements -- and lo and behold, I found a better product! To a Trader Joe's I go and what do I see there? Peanut butter, 16 oz jar, costing one-ninety-nine (yep), whose ingredients section reads as follows: peanuts. That's it! Peanut butter means crushed peanuts -- no palm oil, no useless flax oil, no sugar cane, definitely no transfats -- no nothing, just peanuts. That's the kind I'm going to be buying now, and so should you. This butter here, otoh, is OK but, despite ALA, not the best, and it's overpriced. It is, however, definitely preferable to regular (and cheaper) makes of peanut butter that are full of poisonous substances, so my bottom line is:<br /><br />This is a decent, safe product that you should buy if you can't get the Trader Joe's kind; look for it on sale (don't buy it here, it's overpriced, at least at the time of posting this note). Don't buy into the ALA hype: ALA is all but useless to humans, and its small presence in this butter is of no great value.<br /><br />01/16/2012: Was at ACME yesterday (not the place you'd go for best prices), they carry this thing again now, for three-fifty a jar. Still cheaper than here (a dozen at three-fifty will be forty-two, and again, you don't have to buy a dozen to get this price)."
"I feel like I've landed in heaven with this healthy peanut butter! No yucky ""natural"" bland taste like most all-natural peanut butters and no ""fake sweetener"" taste either. It is so good! I buy most everything on Amazon due to low costs as a ""subscribe and save"" shopper but this is definitely not an item that is cheaper here whatsoever. Catch it at regular price at local supermarkets for around $3.50/16 oz jar or 2 for $5.00 on sale. Try it! You'll be pleasantly surprised at how delicious this healthy peanut butter is!"
"Love the stuff.  Is much smoother than even regular peanutbutter!<br />Tastes great...the jars aren't big enough!<br /><br />I've been losing weight steadily since changing peanut butters.<br />Why?

"I'm not an expert on food ingredients.  I know what's good for me and I REALLY know what I like.  I didn't care much for peanut butter until I talked with a nutritionist for my health and she recommended peanut butter in lieu of higher fat proteins.  I looked at the nutritional information for the popular brands (Skippy, Jif, etc) and this brand is far and away the winner of all that I looked at.  This does not include other types of spreads such as sunflower seed butter, almond butter, etc.<br /><br />This peanut butter is delicious!  It's awesome on celery, bananas and just by itself.  I snatch this up whenever it's on sale.  I just wish it came in a bigger jar."
"bland, and boring... thick crust.<br /><br />My daughter wouldn't eat the fish at all due to the trout's skin which has a slimy consistency.<br /><br />The fish had no flavor and no texture.  The crust is like a big, thick blanket of a pre- processed mashed up casing, not a traditional bread crumb / with cheese topping.  It has no texture and the flavor is lacking."
"Elecare mixes well and we use the unflavored version for our 12 week old son. He has a milk allergy and acid reflux and has adjusted to this formula well. We weaned him from Nutramigen to this a 1/3 at a time.Our gastro Dr. recommended adding non-alcohol vanilla(we use Frontier brand that we bought at a local health food store) available on Amazon.com organic natural foods section, to give it a little flavor(as by itself doesn't taste so good),so I add about 1/2-3/4tsp for each mixed 16 oz. seems to do the trick."
"I just want to say how thankful my husband and I are for Elecare. With every other formula we tried my daughter on she had every symptom from diahrrea,gas,colic,reflux,projectile vomiting(at least once a day). We went from milk based formulas to lactose free and from lactose free to the amino acid formula. The very first day on elecare we noticed a tremendous difference! Pretty much all the problems with the other formulas disappeared after one bottle! It was like we had a new baby all together. The only downfall to the formula i have seen is that because it is so broken down, it is much thinner than typical formulas however we thicken it a little with xantham gum and she has no problems keeping it down now. Good formula if your baby has digestion problems!!"
"My toddler who was 13 months at the time of me ordering this weighed 14 lbs, she was small and frail, but tall... After Ive used this the past few months, shes gained healthy weight and she looks healthy and vibrant.  it also cleared up her eczema as well as her dark circles under her eyes.  Shes now 15 months and 21 lbs!  Shes went from 5-10 percentile up to 50 percentile!! I love this product and it was referred to me by my family doctor.  We are using it every day now.  Please try it if you feel your toddler is not gaining weight or absorbing nutrition correctly.  Blessings"
"This product is needed for my son, he can not have anyother formula!! For the price of this product it is definitely worth it."
"We had to use this formula b/c my son ended up with serious GI issues, and this was the only thing he tolerated. He was (is) sensitive to milk, soy, and wheat - this breaks those proteins down to a digestible/tolerable  form for him. We did have issues with the Vanilla flavored one, which appeared in the form of spitting up more, and was confirmed when he had other foods with vanilla in them.  If your kids has any food sensitivities, could be anything, not just the common ones! Also, our doctor gave us samples to see if it would work, after having tried about 4 other formulas."
"I don't know if this is your mother's sage, but it's acceptable. Not the highest quality, lots of stem cuts. Might be of more use in making smudge sticks then seasoning."
"It looks like sage.  It smells like sage.  It even tastes like sage.<br /><br />It comes packaged in a non-resealable foil-like bag, so make sure you have an airtight container large enough to store it.<br /><br />I make my own sausage, and this sage makes chicken-apple sausage taste great."
i use this to make my own pork breakfast sausage and flavor soups and stews. will continue to buy Frontier products
"You can never have too much fresh, delicious sage.  Great consistency.  Green.  Not seedy or stemmy.  Use it for spiritual purposes or give some to your friends!  This was a really good purchase."
I ordered this 16oz sack of sage from Amazon and recieved it in 2 days. This is EXCELLENT SAGE. I use a lot of sage in making Homemade Sausage and buying it in bulk(16oz) amounts is GREAT. The consisitancy of the rubbed sage was GREAT. I definately will be buying this product again !!!
"I guess there might be other natural peanut butters for sale in expensive health-food stores, but I haven't tried them.  However, in the regular super-markets, the only peanut butter I'll buy is SKIPPY NATURAL!  It is the best tasting, and won't clog your arteries.  For those who think it is un-healthy because they remove some peanut oil and replace it with natural palm oil, I disagree.  Peanut oil separates and has to be stirred up every time, or you have to refrigerate it, and then it doesn't spread well.  Palm oil has saturated fat, but it is the healthy kind, produced by the palm tree, not chemically altered partially hydrogenated oil like in regular p.b.  Palm oil is high in oleic acid, like olive oil, among many other things, which are good for you.  Sure, plain peanuts and salt makes a pretty healthy p.b., but it is inconvenient and my family doesn't like it, and I don't care for it much myself.  If we can eat a peanut butter that tastes great, keeps well in the cabinet, spreads easily, and is better for us than most, and maybe just about as good for us as any other, what do you think we're going to do?"
"I've had all flavors of Skippy and one jar of every other brand I could find, including the old fashioned ones that separate, and this one was the best for my needs.<br /><br />It tastes as good or better than regular skippy.  The taste is very much like Skippy's regular product.<br /><br />On the topic of texture, it is like a more spreadable version of Skippy or JIF.  If regular peanut butter was thick enough to tear bread if you spread it too quickly, this one is not.  It goes on smooth, as if it was whipped.<br /><br />This peanut butter doesn't stick to the mouth as much.  There is still some of that beloved sticking action, but only half that of normal PB.  The mouth-feel of this peanut butter is differemt than any I've had, so you may like it or dislike it.  Personally, I think it's a lot better.<br /><br />A response to some criticism I've read about this peanut butter that made no sense to me, for the sake of explaining why these criticisms should make no sense to you as well:<br /><br />Is this product dishonest for saying ""All Natural"" without containing only peanut oil?  No.<br />The bad reviews this received focused on how it has palm oil, and those reviewers seem to think that means it is a dishonest product, since it says ""All natural"".  I could go on a rant about how crude oil is natural and turpentine is organic, but it would make more sense to explain that ""All Natural"" peanut butter doesn't have to be the type that separates.  The stuff that separates is typically ""Old Fashioned"" or ""Home Made"" peanut butter.  If your Peanut butter is separating and it says ""All Natural"" you need to be aware that they are following only one possible ""All Natural"" formulation for peanut butter and that the kid that you are looking for is more reliably found with an ""Old Fashioned"" written somewhere on the jar.<br /><br />Another thing I've heard is that it contains sugar and salt, and that any ""All Natural"" product shouldn't have those.  To that I ask, ""Do you know what the definition of 'Peanut butter' is?"".  Peanut butter is not a spread made of peanut flour and oil, and never has been.  Since day one it was flavored with oil and/or salt.  Being put off by the salt and sugar content is like being upset that lemon-aid contains sugar or water instead of lemons alone.  If you are in the market for a diabetic friendly peanut butter, this is not for you,  Stay away.  If you are looking for something low in salt, because of your high blood pressure, stay away from this product.  It is only as low in salt as the average ""Peanut Butter"" in the same isle of the store.  If you are trying to eat healthily and want to avoid sugar or salt, find one that doesn't have those ingredients, but don't blame Skippy for making a bad product when the definition of peanut butter nearly always calls for sugar and salt, historically.<br /><br />Is peanut oil more healthy than palm oil peanut butter?  Depends on your beliefs.<br />I like coconut oil, and coconut oil comes from the coconut palm.  Palm oil isn't exactly canola, but it has one great property that you aren't going to get in peanut oil.  It leaves the peanut butter thick and creamy, without the separation.  There are almost no people who believe saturated trans fat is healthier for you than palm oil, so from that perspective this is a huge gain in healthiness over regular Skippy that I've been eating all these years as my favorite peanut butter.  Peanut oil might be healthier than palm, to some people, but it is solely omega-6, so if that someone is in the US, they are probably consuming too much omega-6 already.  If you're looking for an oil soup with some peanut plaster at the bottom, definitely buy ""Old Fashioned"" peanut butter, but for people like me, who value texture, this product is the ultimate blend of healthy and enjoyable.  You can't have everything ideal in life, and if you could there wouldn't be any peanut oil in this product at all... it would be omega-3 based algal oil.  No oil is perfect and I like my peanut butter creamy and without needing a long mixing process that ends in a product that is different on the bottom of the jar than the top."
"My kids hated the natural peanut butters that I used to buy and I hated to use the ones that had hydrogenated oils in them. Kudos to Skippy for developing this. This stuff spreads like the other ones, tastes like the other ones and costs about the same (if you can find it). And it doesn't separate. My kids love it and so do I."
"The name of this product is a bit misleading. Most people assume that if peanut butter is labeled ""natural"" that the only ingredients are peanuts (though some manufacturers add a little salt to their natural peanut butter, too). Skippy, however, also adds sugar and extracts the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. I don't believe most people would think that something made from peanuts would ""naturally"" contain palm oil. So while Skippy is technically correct in labeling this ""natural"" since it does not contain any artificial ingredients, I think they're consciously taking advantage of the fact that most people would think ""natural"" peanut butter just contains peanuts and its byproducts."
"When my health care provider asked me to eat concentrated amounts of protein as between meal snacks,  what could I choose?  That was my dilemma.<br /><br />When looking for snacks I needed something that was easy to carry around with me and rather low in carbohydrates.  I kept finding snack bars and snack cups that were mostly sugars and carbs.  Those are nice for energy snacks, but not for long term slow release that comes from protein.<br /><br />Then I found Skippy Natural Peanut Butter.  To begin it has only 6 grams pf carbohydrates per serving compared with 15 grams for other brands.  Next it does have 7 grams of protein.  So with Skippy I get my protein (most PB has about 7 g), with far fewer carbs.<br /><br />Next I compared the other ingredients.  Skippy Natural contains peanuts, a little palm oil, a pinch of salt, and a bit of sugar.  Regular brands toss in corn syrup, fully hydrogenated vegetable oils, digryceriges, molasses, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, copper sulfate, and pyridokinne hydrochloride.  Skippy Natural is the clear choice on the basis of ingredients.<br /><br />Skippy Natural tastes good and spreads smooth.  I recommend Skippy Natural."
"this is a very smooth peanut butter that doesn't separate in the jar. I also doesn't have soy added to it like most pb's, which is good cuz' I'm allergic to soy."
"The taste is good, it is shelf stable and it does not separate, but the name is somewhat misleading.<br />Most natural peanut butters contain one ingredient- peanuts. Some brands also add a touch of salt as a flavor enhancer. This product contains peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt. The palm oil is where I am disappointed. Skippy removes a portion of the peanut oil and replaces it with palm oil. The peanut oil can be sold for a substantial profit, so it is removed during processing and replaced with very inexpensive palm oil."
"This peanut butter tastes good, doesn't have lots of preservatives, and mostly doesn't need to be stirred.  It's a little higher in sugar than necessary, but overall it's pretty healthy as peanut butter goes.  If you want ground peanuts with nothing added, this is NOT the peanut butter for you."
This is a fantastic product for those wanting a healthier version of peanut butter.  We have tried several natural and all agree this is the best of the bunch.
"All of the hype about this product says it does not need to be stirred; it defiantly does, especially if it has been stored in a warm warehouse or house.<br /><br />Stir it !! ... or you won't like the stuff left at the bottom 1/3 !!<br /><br />It does taste wonderful !!"
"Our family loves this peanut butter.  It's made with only four natural ingredients - peanuts, salt, sugar and palm oil.  There's no high fructose corn syrup or things that I can't pronounce.  I think it's much better for us than regular peanut butter."
"I bought this p'nut butter because it is hydrogenated oil-free and because I can't find my previous favorite, Laura Scudders Natural (the one in which the oil separates and only contains peanuts and salt).  This Skippy is OK but not as flavorful as several reviews I read had claimed.  However, right after I placed my order, I noticed that the price skyrocketed by almost triple, so I won't buy it again unless the price comes back down and I can't find my Laura Scudders in the meantime."
Had been buying Smuckers but all that mixing was no wearing on me.  Plus this also come in the crunchy variety.  YES! If it were not for the added sugar it would get 5 stars.
"I really like this peanut butter and it would be 5 star, but had to dock one for its claim that it is ""no need to stir""..  I've always had to stir as there is always a good layer of oil on top.  It's easy enough to stir up and isn't a real hassle, but it's a very misleading claim right on the jar.  Otherwise GREAT and I will continue to purchase."
"This product has palm oil in it, and as far as ""vegetable"" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but its a saturated fat and its NOT healthy.  It also has added sugar.  Smuckers brand might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt."
"Yea, this tastes good, but for those of us who are very picky about the ingredients, and want to avoid Palm oil, try Trader Joe's natural peanut butter(TJ's is a cool store with a lot of their own brand of cool food & stuff); it tastes great is priced great, and has no palm oil, only peanuts and salt. You only have to stir it once. My family loves it and I need buy no other brand."
"Peanut Butter snob here. I always thought the original Skippy was far too sugary, but this stuff is awesome and much healthier than any alternative. There is a bit of liquid at the top of the spread when you first open the top, but it takes 5 seconds to stir it in and you'll never know it was there. Too bad Amazon stopped the S&S on this one."
We really like this peanut butter. The taste is great as my kids do not eat the completely natural peanut butter with only peanuts and salt. I don't care for it much either. This is a nice in-between that I feel is pretty healthy. We get this auto-shipped by Amazon for convenience and price. We go through a lot of PBJs for 3 kids' school lunches and I eat quite a few of them too!
"I am always torn between buying the yummier peanut butter with the icky trans fat and the healthier peanut butter that doesn't taste nearly as good. Well, actually, I'm not torn, I've just been buying the  icky tasting organic, need to be stirred type peanut butter. I saw the Skippy Natural in the store and quickly scanned the ingredients. No hydrogenated oils... sweet! The ingredients are roasted peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt. I do realize that peanut butter is healthier without the oil, sugar and salt, but I also know that it's nearly impossible to have the best of both worlds, so it's a trade off. With Skippy Natural I get healthier peanut butter and a fabulous taste! Plus, when I compare it to the nutrition facts in Adams Natural Peanut Butter here's what I get:<br /><br />  --------Adam's  -  Skippy Natural  Serving size 2tbsp in both<br />Calories  -  200  -  190<br />Total Fat  -  16 grams  -  16 grams<br />Sat Fat  -  2.5 grams  -  3.5 grams<br />Sodium  -  105 mg  -  150 mg<br />Total Carbs  -  6g  -  6g<br />Protein  -  7g  -  7g<br /><br />So, we're not looking at the much of a difference at all. I will take the better tasting peanut butter in this instance. If the nutrition was severely compromised then I would make a different choice, but not in this case! Now every time I see someone at the store reaching for the gross, hydrogenated peanut butter I want to show them this and compare the ingredients for them and explain that it tastes just as good as what they're planning on getting. I politely mind my own business and move along. I would be awesome if they marketed this stuff better though.  Grab a jar and a spoon and try the creamiest, yummiest peanut butter without the unnecessary trans fat.<br />Nutrition from [...] and the back of my Skippy jar"
"In a nutshell, this peanut butter is short on ingredients and requires no stirring.  They remove excess peanut oil and replace it with palm oil which helps the butter stay creaming and eliminates the oil floating on top.  A lot of PB was made this way until palm oil fell under the 'all saturated fats will leap from the jar and kill you' mentality.  Palm oil is (like peanut oil) full of saturated fats, but the types of saturated fats in it are largely shown to be at least somewhat beneficial and are certainly no worse for you than peanut oils.  Do some research and then buy this peanut butter, it has excellent taste and texture and the no-stir nature makes it a lot more kid friendly for them to open and use."
"Good quality great price now I have six jars to tide me over. Yes, I am guilty of just eating it off of a spoon for my snack."
"Very Healthy peanut butter compared to others...Skippy Peanut Butter, Natural Creamy, 15-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)....This taste great and avoids bad fats...I had bought some sunflower seed butter as an alternative only to see it contained Hydrogenated oils...BOO! Hiss!"
"I like the Natural Creamy because it has less of the ""other stuff"", but isn't crazy oily on the top (there is a small layer of oil but doesn't need stirring). Really tasty too! When doing the subscribe and save this was a pretty good deal."
I bought them because they were on sale.  But they turned out great and taste great in peanut butter balls too.  yum
"I ordered this peanut butter pack for a holiday food drive that we were having at my church. This pack included 6 large size jars of peanut butter. The price was perfect. If I had purchased these jars individually at the grocery store, I would have been paying about $5 to $6 a jar."
"Skippy Natural peanut butter is awesome. It is well worth your time to get this product, not only is it delicious but it is a healthier alternative to traditional peanut butter that has a ton of additives. Try it, you will love it!"
"Smooth creamy and delish!!!  What more can you ask. Kids and parents both enjoy this PB. Give it a try, you might be surprised!!"
"I absolutely love the Skippy natural peanut butter. It is every bit as delicious and the same yummy peanut butter we love, but I love seeing the few simple ingredients in the jar. Nothing that I can't read! :) My hubby love Super-Chunk, I love Creamy. We both love the Natural addition to Skippy's product line."
"This peanut butter is just what I wanted.  It tastes excellent, is healthy for you and just what I want for a quick snack.  I tend to eat it with apples, alone or in protein shakes.  It also comes at a great price so I see myself ordering more down the line."
This is a great tasting all natural peanut butter that needs no refrigeration or storing.  There is added palm oil but no hydrogenated oils (bad guys).
I was pleasantly surprised by the creamy texture and excellent flavor of Skippy Naturals.  Most healthier peanut butter products have an unpleasant separation of peanuts and oil. Yet I didn't see that with this brand.  This is a product even my picky 9 year old daughter enjoys.  I highly recommend it.
"Well, if you read the one-star reviews, you already know this has got other things besides peanuts in it... which I could care less about.  This tastes fabulous to me, the price is right, and for as often as i eat peanut butter, which is only a couple days weekly, I'm not too worried about the little bit of sugar and oil they added."
"I've been buying the Skippy Natural Peanut Butter for a few years, but once I found it on Amazon, I was a happy camper. Generally the best price anywhere and I love getting it in a larger package so I don't have to replace it quite as often. We use a lot of peanut butter around here!"
This is all we have been eating since trying it.  Not too sure how 'Natural' it is but we like the taste
"Skippy natural is the only way I can get my fiance to not eat regular peanut butter which has hydrogenated oils.  Skippy natural has palm oil which is bottom of the barrel oil, so it's still not as good for him as completely natural, need-to-be-stirred peanut butter.  But I'll take it as an alternative.  Flavor is good.  This is the creamy version for him.  I prefer the super chunk which really does taste great."
"I get these for my dogs, and for the price they are great.<br /><br />My dogs love peanut butter so i give it to them as a snack and also i use it to bake them dog snacks. I did taste it, it tastes like peanut butter...<br />But i really like the fact that you do not need to stir it, its always the same consistency and that's a major plus for me"
"I was a bit skeptical at first because my kids love peanut butter but are very picky about it.  Skippy Natural passed the test easily.  They love it!  Will continue with the autoship as it will be gone before the next shipment.  Good job, Skippy and thanks Amazon for the easy purchase"
I really wanted a peanut butter that was better for our family.  This DEFINITELY hits the spot!  And I love that there is no stirring like a lot of natural peanut butters.  It is absolutely delicious!!!
"I recently bought a 6 pack of Skippy Natural Peanut Butter and my family loves it.  My husband took a jar to work to use with snacks and my son has been working on a jar too.  It has a creamy, light consistency, not oily like other brands.  Tastes a bit sweet, but my boys love that fact.  Worth the money.  I did notice that local stores started carrying this product this month too.  So, no more shipping..."
"Product is great, so was the packaging and price.<br /><br />Separately, I placed a 1:1 order under Subscribe and Save: S&S was cancelled after this was received since I don't order online frequently. The one order of six jars was received and that's all I paid for. Amazon keeps sending me reminders that I have another order to be paid and my account will be locked until it's resolved. I sent them a screen shot of My Account/Orders showing nothing else was requested. Either they have a glitch in the order process or something else is going on. I'll see what comes of the request sent to them to remove the unauthorized/disputed item(s) and restore my account."
"We're fans of the ""brown lid,"" natural-style, peanut butters... and Skippy doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The peanut flavor is strong, there's no oil separation (so no stirring is necessary) and the texture is very creamy / smooth.  As far as differences between this and the ""natural"" offerings of other brands, as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can't tell a difference... so we don't mind changing it up with whatever is on sale.<br /><br />That said, as long as Amazon continues to carry this 6-pack at a reasonable price with their S&S program, I anticipate that we'll continue to enjoy it."
I'm very happy with the deal I got on Skippy Peanut butter.  We go thru peanut butter very quickly so I am hoping the 6 that I ordered on sale and delivered to my doorstep! will keep us going for awhile.
"Purchased the items while perusing [...] and decided to take a chance on what looked like a good product from a known company.  I was hesitant to buy any peanut butter with ""Natural"" in the name because of past experience, but decided to try it.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of probably the finest peanut butter i have ever tasted.  My childeren and wife agreed with me.  They all like to snack on it from the jar.<br />I was also pleasantly surprised that there was not any oils sitting at the top of the product.<br />We will definitely be purchasing more of this and soon."
"Skippy Natural is good, but I prefer Teddie Natural because it tastes more like natural, freshly ground, peanut butter. I bought the Skippy because it was a good price and it's a bit easier because you don't need to stir it when you first open it. The oil in Teddie Natural separates and floats on top, but once mixed and refrigerated it stays mixed pretty well. I also like the Skippy because it doesn't require refrigeration, so I can keep it in my desk at work for a quick snack."
Product came in a timely fashion.  Good creamy taste.  And I love that it is Natural.  But Jiff still tastes the best.
"Wonderful sale of Natural Peanut Butter.Very smooth and good quality. And I used my swag bucks coupon to get another $5 off<br />this purchase.  I originally was purchasing regular skippy but since it was gone, I thought I'd give Natural Skippy a try.<br />Loved it. We've already gone though 2 jars! Highly recommend it and it came right to my door! fast service!"
"I usually get Smucker's Natural PB but this is so much better.  No oil separation, no need for stirring.  Its just amazing."
"Love this brand of peanut butter and the kids love it. Great price on Amazon, love the fast shipping, what more is there to say!"
"Tastes like PB... I guess I'm not as refined as others but it tastes like PB, I'd say it's good.<br />However, the ""no stirring needed"" is a bit deceptive. It still has oil in it (I think it's natural in peanuts), and if you let it sit awhile, some of it does come to the top."
"I love to take PB and J for lunch at work so I wanted to get a bulk peanut butter.  I like the natural peanut butters, but most have a big layer of oil at the top that you have to stir into the jar and that gets old fast (and messy).  The Skippy natural is much better.  Some jars have no oil on top, others a thin layer that stirs in quickly.  The PB is smooth and spreads easily.  It tastes great, as one would expect with the simple ingredients.<br /><br />If you like the basic natural peanut butter, it doesn't get much better than this."
I was very pleased with items. Such an awesome deal for a wonderful product. Amazon shipped item extremely fast...was here in two days!. Will definitely buy more from Amazon.
"I try to buy more natural products. Both my husband and I love peanut butter, and it is a good healthy source of protein. However, the ""all natural"" products are messy because you have to stir them. And if you store it in the refrigerator to keep it from separating, it gets too hard. This product is a good compromise - it does have a trace of less-than-healthy fat but much less than ""regular"" PB, and best of all, no stirring!"
"made the switch from another brand to this peanut better after buying this on a sale here at amazon. Overall it is very tasty on peanut butter and jelly, peanut butter bread, peanut butter on ritz, peanut butter on chocolate and whatever else we use it for. Very happy and we will be buying this again."
"I like this peanut butter... it is tasty and creamy, contains no trans fats, and I didn't have to stir it which can be messy. It does contain palm oil (non-hydrogenated) and sugar though, but it didn't taste like it had sugar in it so it must be a very small amount. Anyway, some may not want those ""unnecessary"" ingredients... but overall I like it and think it is worthy of 4 out of 5 stars."
"I like the taste of this, and also like not having to stir this peanut butter, unlike other natural PB's. Good at home and to keep in the office for a snack."
"I have to love all the reviews and comments to those reviews debating the meaning of the word ""natural,"" and whether or not this qualifies as a ""natural"" product. Folks, it doesn't matter if it's natural or not, it's not even peanut butter. Peanut butter is ground-up peanuts, with or without salt. This is a ""peanut butter spread"" -- just like it says **right on the front of the container** -- and contains sugar and palm oil.<br /><br />That being said, this is probably one of the least offensive-tasting peanut butter spreads on the market. There's a decent peanut flavor, although the sugar makes it too sweet for me. But my dog likes it, so it's what we buy for her. I'll stick with the REAL (a.k.a old fashioned) stuff; I've found Trader Joe's to have some of the best out there. Seemingly unlike most people, I actually have the two minutes of time it takes to stir a jar of peanut butter (not spread!)."
"How long have I been confounded by the polarization of peanut butter spreads!<br /><br />For most of my life, I have had to settle for either highly processed conventional conveyor belt variety peanut butter or the dreaded settler variety of old fashioned peanut butter where the oil seperates from the nutmeat leaving a crusty and dry hunk of unspreadable peanut matter.<br /><br />No longer! This spread has it all. Great taste, spreadibity and, can you believe this, better for you! It was high time, and the great minds at Skippy have made this possible.<br /><br />Mankind, rejoice!"
"I have very picky eaters in my house and this peanut butter is really great tasting and healthier too!  After learning about transfats and really fealing guilty giving my kids PB&J sandwiches in their lunch with not so healthy peanut butter, I decided to try this one and really love it.  Thanks Skippy!  You did it right."
"This is a very smooth, peanuty peanut butter. It goes well with jam and bread for a delicious PB&J.<br />The Natural in the product title attracted me.<br />Salt and palm oil are part of the ingredients. I have made peanut butter and like the natural taste. This Skippy product delivers that taste!<br />There is just a hint of oil when opening the bottle... no stirring required. Just smooth, thick peanut butter on your knife with easy spreading.<br />Not an organic peanut butter... this is a very tasty peanut butter with a step toward the healthier side of products. My new peanut butter of choice is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E4S8GO"">Skippy Peanut Butter, Natural Creamy, 15-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Update... my last shipment of peanut butter... all the jars had lots of oil on the top, very hard to get mixed into the jar... first time I've had this problem so I'm downgrading them from 5 star to 3 star... the product has to be consistent!<br /><br />I'll order them and update one more time... if they're still oily... I'll move on to another brand."
"This is my favorite natural peanut butter.  I know it isn't as ""natural"" as Smuckers, but it's the best of both worlds to me.  I don't think you can beat the price through the Subscribe and Save and I love never having to wait for a sale at the store or try to find a coupon.  Great deal!"
"Even though this isn't truly natural in the sense that other natural peanut butters are (containing only 100% peanuts), it is still healthier than your average grocery store peanut butter.  But, the best part of Skippy Natural is the taste: I can't ever go back to the typical JIF-style peanut butter."
"The peanut butter tastes slightly better than the Kroger brand, but cost much more.  The word ""Natural"" is misleading since, as another reviewer pointed out, palm oil is added.  I will not by this product again and will avoid all Jiffy peanut butter in the future.<br /><br />Update--03/05/2012:  I now definately believe that the use of the word ""Natural"" was meant to mislead the consumer into believing that this product contained something better than ""un-natural"" peanut butter.  Apparently, this is the new buzz word that companies use to get us to buy something which is better for us healthwise, but there are no FDA standards to the word ""Natural"" which many products now claim."
"Oops scuse me -- got peanut butter stuck on the roof of my mouth. Skippy - I LOOVE you!!!<br /><br />I've been consuming Skippy ever since I was a little tiny child who just BARELY knew how to slap peanut butter on a slice of bread and then slap jelly and another slice of bread over it and then head for school (Mom NEVER made our lunches). Truth be told, I once even slapped some sardines under the jelly -- I never did that again.<br /><br />I have seen MANY competitors come and go and even -- gasp!! -- tried some of those products, but always came back to the familiar taste and texture and comfort of Skippy -- whether Chunky or Smooth -- I LOOVE Skippy."

Bought this under a promotion and subscription for $9.32 for 6 jars.  A pretty good discount over retail.  The next shipment and all future shipments were supposed to be $11.32.  The next subscription shipment ended up being $17.56 so I canceled it.  This price made it over what I would have paid retail at my local store.  If you are going to offer a good deal honor it.  The product was good.  It is the pricing charged by Amazon.com that I have a problem with.
"I'm used to Peter Pan Crunchy and Jif/Skippy Extra Chunky, so I guess my general feelings for creamy are a bit low to start with, but this stuff is downright terrible. It says no need to stir, but every jar I've opened has a few mm of oil floating on top, which kills the texture and taste of this PB. I tend just to drain that and whatever sticks, I just stir in. Chunky/crunchy is naturally healthier and less oily and is so good you can eat it straight up. This stuff just feels gross on my tongue. Maybe good for those who like PB&J and don't like the PB to overpower the J or whatever, but I never buy jelly/jam, so I dunno why I even bought this."
We love Skippy and this was such a good deal!!  I couldn't get any better even if I matched sale prices to coupons.
I bought these peanut butter canisters for a food pantry I support in Texas that does fantastic work. Support your local food pantry! People in the US are hungry!
"Finally a peanut butter that dosent have corn syrup or hydrogenated vegetable oils in it. It spreads easy, tastes great and is decently priced. I tried the Jiff version and didnt like it at all."
"You can't get much better than Skippy Natural peanut butter, especially at this price.  Amazon Subscribe & Save is almost the best thing since sliced bread and Skippy Natural is practically the best thing to put ON sliced bread!  I paid half of what it costs in the store by ordering through Amazon and got enough peanut butter to last about 4 months!  Plus, this stuff contains nothing but peanuts, sugar, and palm oil, no damn high-fructose corn syrup.  (No, it's not the same as table sugar.)<br /><br />I will certainly order more of this awesome peanut butter again and I will do it through Amazon Subscribe & Save.  You just can't beat this stuff!<br /><br />Out."
"Very good value for natural peanut butter.  Especially since you don't have to stir Skippy.  Does have a little added sugar, but not much compared to Smucker's natural peanut butter."
This peanut butter is natural and tastes great.  I eat it on Ritz crackers mainly.  It is creamy as it says on the jar and so good.  I will have some today now that I am talking about it.  Haha.  Great delivery time too.
"Skippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter is really yummy stuff!  Some people may have a fit because it's debatable whether this is truly a natural product, however I think that roasted peanuts, sugar, palm oil, and salt is pretty good in terms of ingredients.  It doesn't require stirring, nor refrigeration, and tastes great with waffles and jam.  The jars are kinda small (15 oz only), but considering it's a six pack I don't have to drive to the store to purchase another jar because the kids sucked the stuff down, it's a great deal.  Yum Yum Yum recommended!"
"if you have ever had good pure natural peanut butter, this isn't it. It may be more natural than the regular blend, but it is still commercial peanut butter and has added oils for stabilizer. I was ok, but i wouldn't get it again."
"I know that the label is a bit misleading - for a purist - it isn't close enough to 'Natural' - but, sometimes compromise is in order and this is one time when we will compromise a bit - just because you don't have to stir it and because the consistency is closer to the peanut butter we got used to using and the price is right. This product tastes great and the consistency is just like regular peanut butter. Nothing worse than to get a bite of peanut butter than is so dry and gunky that it sticks to the roof of your mouth or so runny that it won't stay on the bread. At least it is NOT hydrogenated. I am hoping that the palm oil won't kill us. We don't live on peanut butter, so are hoping we will be ok with this product.<br />The price on Amazon.com isn't bad - but, we just can't manage six jars at a time. But, maybe get someone to share the purchase? That would be a good option.<br />I give this product a THUMBS UP rating of FIVE STARS!!"
This is a delicious peanut butter and so easy to spread on a cracker without breaking the cracker.  Only negative we have is that there is occasionally an air space in the jar so don't really get the full jar but have only found this once out of 6 jars.  Love the peanut butter.
"Well, shame on me. I saw the ""Natural"" on the label, assumed that it was just ground peanuts (not reading carefully enough), and wound up with 6 jars of regular old american peanut butter that's loaded with sugar. Of course it tastes good, is mixed well and stays mixed, and lasts long on the shelf, but you pay for those things."
"My whole family LOVES this peanut butter. I searched everywhere for a peanut butter that is creamy without the oil separation... AND I didn't want any hydrogenated oils OR high fructose corn syrup... this magic bottle of yummy is the PERFECT because it does not contain any of the earlier ingredients, the texture is smooth and the flavor is the best!! I won't use anything else!!"
"This product arrived very quickly and for a great price.  My family was looking for a healthier alternative to regular peanut butter, and this seems to fit the bill.  It is much, much smoother than the Jif or Peter Pan peanut butter we normally eat, and tastes great.  I have also used it in a couple of recipes (cake, bread, peanut butter cups, and cookies) and it seems to perform and taste just as good as using traditional peanut butter.  If you are looking for a more ""natural"" peanut butter, I would recommend this product as a worthy replacement."
"Product was delivered very fast, in fact, I think I got it the next day."
Compare the ingredients.. This stuff is no better for you than the original Skippy. They both have the same ingredients (check for yourself) except the one thing they changed was replacing that nasty partially hydrogenated oil with palm oil which is no better for you and will still clog your arteries. If you're truly looking for a natural peanut butter look for one without any oils added to it period. I myself really like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter with Honey. It tastes great. Stirring it can be a pain but it is so worth it if it's better for our health.
"As a rule, you should always check the fine print of anything you buy and not the BIG BOLD LABEL that says ALL NATURAL or FAT FREE or NO ADDED SUGAR. The marketing strategy was not for those who are looking to buy the creamy, easy to spread peanut butter nor for those who wants no partially hydrogenated oils in their PB. But it is for those who wants ""All Natural"" those who thinks they are just buying all peanut, all healthy, no saturated fats PB.<br />Others are saying they dont care whats in it as long as it's creamy and tasty and their kids love it but this review is not about the taste. We already know that Skippy products are tasty and creamy and yes my kids loves PB for breakfast. Im sorely reviewing about product labelling. All Im saying is theres nothing special about it. They could have just said, its PB without PHO. But again, it's all about strategy and consumers like us really needs to educate ourselves."
"Check the ingredients:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Palm Oil, Salt.<br /><br />Go for the Costco brand, or Laura Scudder.  Their ingredients:  Peanuts"
"I am used to the old fashioned kinds with just peanuts and salt as ingredients. I thought I would try Skippy Natural Creamy peanut butter spread simply because a recipe called for it. I tried some before using it and this stuff tastes like oil and wax. If you like fake flavors than you might like this. Otherwise, stick with the real stuff that you have to stir, it's so worth it!"
"WARNING: This is NOT natural peanut butter.  There is ADDED Sugar, which is HORRIBLE for anybody following a sensible diet!"
"For all of you espresso fans!!! You must try this blend.<br /><br />It's smooth and has a fabulous taste, and the price is nice.<br /><br />Cafe Kimbo Espresso forever!!!"
"Rich flavor easy on the pallet. Tried other espresso,this one is very decent.<br />Not to bland not to rich. Low acid bold taste."
"They had this for sale once in Lone Tree, CO at Safeway. I gave it a try and it was absolutely the best. Imported from Italy. They stopped selling it, I guess it was about $16/container at that place, and I haven't been able to find it anywhere since. Found it here, just got a bunch of cans :P<br /><br />I would never buy anything else. The smell is what gets me every time. So smooth!"
"Short review. This is the coffee the Neapolitans, who live in Napoli, drink. Enough said. Simply the best!"
This is truly delicious coffee and it has the side benefit of making the whole house smell like you're baking!
"Cameron's is a great tasting coffee and a great value for the price.  This particular favorite--along with the toasted pecan--is my favorite.  I'm a picky coffee drinker, and I'm impressed by the quality of this coffee.  The smell is intoxicating and the flavor is unmatched.  I often buy several of these 32-ounce bags and keep them in the freezer.  They stay fresh for several months.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't grind it until you're about to use it and toss in a French Press for best results."
"This coffee, with its hint of chocolate, is delightful to drink.  I signed up for the 3 month subscription plan but will be purchasing more frequently.  For someone who really tastes their coffee (I drink it black and straight) can say that I am truly enjoying this."
This is one of the best flavored coffees I've ever had.  The smell is incredible and the taste is just wonderful.  It's a big bag for the price too which is great.  I highly recommend trying it because you won't regret it!
"I make coffee for myself and my significant other nearly every weekday morning using a Krups grinder and a Bodum press.<br /><br />Normally we buy coffee in small quantities from bulk bins at the local Safeway, Whole Foods, and Sunflower Market (the later of which roasts their own) and the only other time I've tried whole bags like this was from Starbucks which was a truly unpleasant experience to have to use up.<br /><br />But this coffee is delightful!  It's well packed with a dehumidification button so it was very fresh.  Standard dark bag with closure otherwise so you can keep it that way for a while.  It's some of the oiliest beans I've seen (which means very rich/strong coffee if you use the same amount).  It grinds well (although does tend to ""powder"" more, creating more sediment that slips through the metal filter on the Bodum).<br /><br />Not very bitter at all and you can definitely taste the caramel and chocolate, especially if you slurp it.  Gives it a great natural sweetness (which yeah, I do supplement with Stevia) even though it is a stronger coffee.  Seems to be medium acid, medium roast.  The smell is not as chocolaty as some of the grocery store chocolate varieties, but it's still pleasant and the taste is superior to the grocery store in my mind, even if the chocolate/caramel are supporting players to the coffee flavor (as they should be) instead of trying to overwhelm it like, say, the chocolate macadamia variety sold by Safeway.<br /><br />Great smell, pleasant to drink, good after taste and hits the tongue well.  No real complaints, save that 2 lbs will take me several months to use.  I'd definitely be tempted to order from this company again and it'd be nice to try more of their flavors.  Love the freshness and oiliness of the beans.  Great job!"
"Very artificial tasting.  Can't particularly taste chocolate or caramel, and definitely no coffee taste.  Not sure what this tastes like, but it's not good.  Also a little sour."
"I have had many different kinds of coffee. I have also become excited about many different coffees I have purchased because they smelled like they would taste like chocolate, caramel, vanilla, etc. They NEVER have! So, when we found this at our local Big Lots (I know! Score!) I wasn't expecting much. Oh my gosh! I was pleasantly surprised! BEST TASTING coffee, period! It actually tasted like chocolate and caramel and my house smelled AMAZING for hours after I brewed just one cup! Excited to see that Amazon carries it and that almost all the reviewers think it is as great as I think it is. I will be purchasing this through Amazon now, as I don't think I will find it elsewhere in our small town."
We love this coffee.  It has a lot of flavor.  If you like flavored coffee this is as good as it gets.  Beans are very fresh every time we get them.  Price is great too.  I use to buy coffee at Costco but this is just as cheap and tastes a whole lot better!
"I usually don't like caramel candy as it is too sweet, but I was pursuaded to try this flavor - and love it!  The flavors of caramel and brownies are beautifully blended with the coffee flavor and not a bit too sweet.  I have recently ordered more of this flavor and will continue to do so.  Cameron's Coffees are very smooth and creamy."
"I don't add anything except a small amount of half & half to my coffee, so I expect most of the taste to come from the bean and it's flavorings.<br /><br />This coffee is excellent, it has enough chocolate and sweetness to sooth without becoming overwhelming or sugary.<br /><br />I'm normally an AM coffee drinker, but I now often make a 4-cup pot of this instead of a soft drink in the afternoon.<br /><br />The price is amazing. If you don't go through it very fast, freezing it does NOT hurt. There are anecdotal claims that it does, but they come from the same people that say you have to use your coffee up within several days after the beans have been roasted!  Blind taste tests indicate freezing in a sealed bag doesn't damage whole beans, but make sure you've let it thaw in its sealed container so it doesn't absorb unwanted flavors from the air.<br /><br />I use three or four different beans as the mood strikes me. So, I put half a pound of this at a time in an old small coffee can and keep the rest frozen, sealed well-enough in it's original package."
"I think the best part of having this coffee may be grinding it up!  It smells so good.  The taste is very pleasant and doesn't give me heartburn (as some other coffees do).  The chocolate taste is not overwhelming, and according to the company's website (which I checked before buying it) they do not add any sugars to the coffee.  I find myself adding less sweetener to this coffee because I like the chocolate taste.  I can imagine (although I have not yet tried it) that this might also be good in a few baking recipes that call for coffee.  I will be a repeat purchaser of this coffee, which I have not yet found in any store."
"Chocolate caramel brownie coffee not only sounds yummy it lives up to its promise. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is rich. The chocolate and caramel combo is perfect for that first cup in the morning, an afternoom pick me up, or an after dinner treat. I am a big fan of the chocolate coffees and this is one of the great ones. We bought the whole bean variety and will purchase again."
Cameron's Chocolate Caramel Brownie Coffee is by far the tastiest of Any other coffee I have had.  Best for breakfast or in front of a cozy fire.  The flavor is delicious.
"My background in coffee has range ... I can drink the strongest Starbucks coffee or the weaker store bought varieties ... but one thing is for sure, I like my coffee.<br /><br />When I ordered this coffee, I gathered from the current reviews that it was going to be very flavorful and aromatic. This was indeed the case ... it smells and tastes like its namesake. But as with most flavored coffees, it may bore you after awhile (especially since you get a huge amount ... 32 ounces!).<br /><br />I've found that mixing three parts of your more straightforward coffee with one part Cameron's Chocolate Caramel Brownie coffee adds a hint of that amazing flavor without overwhelming your taste buds. Try your own mixture to find that perfect match!"
"Beats dunks, starbucks, and even the little no name places I have been to locally.  I usually don't write reviews but HOLY CRAP this coffee is delicious!  Perfect flavor and absolutely intoxicating aroma.  Don't even hesitate buying this!  GET IT NOW!  The sooner you buy it, the sooner it ships, and the sooner you can be sipping the most delicious brew ever created!  If you don't order this coffee your life will never be complete!<br /><br />I gave a cup of this to my girlfriend and it was immediately followed by incredible sex.  I don't know if that will happen for you, but it made my experience even better!"
"I love my morning coffee, and enjoy trying many different types. Once I found this bag though, I quit trying new things. I get one bag a month now. My entire house smells wonderful of baking when I grind the coffee beans. I drink my coffee black, and love the nice smooth taste. Not bitter or very strong. Would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys flavored coffee."
Better than I could have imagined.  I can close my eyes and feel like I just ate a brownie covered in caramel.
"Tried other cameron's coffee, this is not up to par with the others.<br />Dont have enough lust and flavor, it turns out quite light even with french press."
I was really looking forward to this coffee but I was  very disappointed.  I will not reorder.<br /><br />I received Cameron's TOASTED SOUTHERN PECAN COFFEE as a gift at Christmas and was totally delighted with it and have already reordered it.
"I usually find flavored coffees to have a bitter aftertaste that reminds me of pecan or walnut skins. If you don't have a similar opinion of flavored coffees in general than I doubt this particular one will bother you either. I make coffee in a ratio of 1: 5, chocolate flavored to regular( 8 O'clock 100% Columbian) so it's not like this bitterness is the result of an entire pot of flavored coffee. Chocolate caramel flavor should be smooth and full. When I opened the coffee the beans had a distinctly greasy look and feel. I bought this because of a 'Quick Picks' offer. I have been ordering Coffee Master's Dark Chocolate Decadence via Subscribe and Save and will return to this. I do not find this to be bitter. [...]<br />Update: The bitterness and greasiness must have been the result of some volatile oil. After the container was open for a while both dissipated."
This coffee is not only bad tasting its .....well you cant really tell what you are drinking.....smells delicious......gotta admit that......but the taste is just awful......STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.....WORST COFFEE I Ever Had.
I loved these.  It is so hard to find lime-flavored candy of any sort -- I am so glad to found them.  I will definitely order again.
"In 1989, during my first trip to China, I was sightseeing on Lamma Island, near Hong Kong.  I spent the entire day there and was rather amazed to not see another Westerner.  It was October and the weather was excellent.<br /><br />Browsing the local markets I spotted tins of tea in one small shop.  I was relatively young at the time--only 39--and being rather uncultured I did not know anything about tea.  Purely guessing I selected two tins each of Lichee Black and Jasmine to take back home with me.<br /><br />When I returned home I put the tins in the cabinet and subsequently forgot them.  Years passed and the tins were packed away during various job-related relocations.  My wife then developed a love for fine tea and was therefor given my tins.<br /><br />One afternoon soon after she asked me about the origin of the tins.  I had to think for a while to remember when/where I had originally purchased it.  Much to my surprise, I realized those tins were now 20 years old.  Curious as to their condition I opened one of the tins of Lichee Black.  The aroma was very clean and inviting.  I therefore made myself a cup.  The flavor of that cup of 20 year-old Lichee Black tea was the finest, most genteel I had ever had.<br /><br />In the subsequent 2-3 years, we've grown to appreciate many varieties of tea.  I continue to hoard my half-pound tin of Lichee Black tea and even after repeatedly opening the canister, the tea continues to stay fresh and aromatic, and incredibly smooth.<br /><br />Having just returned this week from my 5th trip to China (Shanghai and Nanchang, this time) I went to good old Amazon to see if my Lichee Black is still commercially available.  I am amazed and very pleased to see that it is.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this variety of tea, whether you are a connoisseur or a novice."
"I have one large mug of lychee tea every morning and I really like this brand.  The aroma is delicate and not overpowering in the morning.  This company's tea is the nicest I have found.  The leaves are also nice and large, not little dust mites!!!  I have been drinking this flavor for several years and truly enjoy it.  Much nicer than other brands I have also tasted/tested :)  Hope you enjoy it as well."
"I have been drinking this brand of lichee tea for over 30 years, whenever I could find it (thank goodness for the internet). The quality has never faltered. As other reviewers say, the lichee in the tea is not overpowering--more of a delicate roselike aroma than a fruity taste. The tea itself is not too tannic, and it re-heats well."
"Couple of years ago a friend of mine gave me some lichee tea that he brought from China. That tea tasted absolutely wonderful, so when I ran out of it I decided to get it from Amazon. Unfortunately I couldn't find the exact same tea, but I figured that lichee tea from china shouldn't be that different from one another, so I ordered Golden Sail brand Lichee Black Tea. Well... what can I say? the difference is huge. This tea is by no means the real thing. It is a decent black tea and I'll drink it, but it's more on the bland side, it has nothing of the wonderful aroma and sweetness of the lichee tea that I had before."
"New to Lichee Black Tea, I was very pleased to discover it is all that others say it is.<br /><br />The aroma of the leaves are very calming and pleasant. The taste of the brew is based on the time of seeping but I have not had a bitter cup yet. I am extremely pleased with this tea and recommend it anyone."
I love this black tea.  I use it with a flavored tea so I am getting all the good stuff from the black tea but I make it tast better with my flavored loose teas.
"I bought this tea as a Christmas gift for my mother. I also got another one tin for myself. Both of us really enjoyed this tea. It has a nice flavor. It can easily be brewed twice.<br />Also something I thought was odd is that the tin has two lids. When you open one lid, there is a smaller opening on the inside with another lid in it. I had never seen this before, but I'm sure it makes it very air tight."
"My daughter and I visited a Japanese tea house and they served lychee iced tea which neither of us had had before. We loved it. (At first it seemed strange--it IS unusual--but it grew on us very quickly.) If you're into trying novel teas, try this!<br /><br />I decided we needed to have some of our own and bought this brand. At first, upon opening, I thought wow, it's really heavily perfumed, and thought maybe we wouldn't like it, but it brews a perfect pot of subtly sweet/flowery tea (I don't use a lot of the leaves and I brew for three minutes, served with milk). Haven't made it iced, yet, but I will.<br /><br />I like that they double seal the container. While everybody else is cutting costs and packaging as cheaply as possible, this is a very nice bonus and will keep the tea flavorful for a long time, I think.<br /><br />I use this for our ""special"" tea, don't drink it every day, because I don't want to become so used to it that it becomes ordinary.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tea!"
This is the smoothest black tea I've come across.  It's delicious and has a great aroma.  The lichee is faint and does not overpower the tea.  Great stuff. Glad to be able to find it online!
I read other reviews on this tea and they are right!  It is a very nice tea and is very fresh.  The people who put this together has it packaged so the antioxidants and flavors are not lost.  It has outer packaging and inner packaging.
"You have got to be kidding! $5 a bottle? Even in the supermarket these are usually $1.25 each, often under $1. I hope you sell none."
At this price and you expect to sell these?... You have to be kidding!  This has got to be a joke?
"When something is in high demand, this is not the way to repay the consumer.  $100 for 20 bottle of water, that is ridiculous.  You people need to get a grip."
"I grew up drinking Community Coffee Dark Roast -- its a southern tradition.  As an adult, I have tried many of the blends of Community and other brands and now know why my family always drank Community.  This blend is my absolute favorite.  Its very rich, smooth, and full of flavor.  Not too dark and not too light.  Its what I drink almost everyday and the one I serve to my family and friends."
"This is one of my favorite coffees.  I like the flavor, as it's smooth and doesn't have the rough edges of many commercial blends."
"I just received my order for this coffee. I have ordered community coffee alot of times but for some reason on this particular order 2 of the 3 packages were not sealed on the bottom and the coffee had spilled out into outer package . I was very disappointed , since I paid for 3 packages and can only use 1 !"
"I am a huge fan of Community Coffee.  The company often runs specials, they are very responsive to their customers and their product is good.<br /><br />I've tried most of their flavors now and this one is a very good one.  I buy this any time i find it on sale.<br /><br />I've written the company asking for samplers and they sent all kinds.  It was great.  I also love their decaf and 1/2 caf products too.<br /><br />They will email you when there are large storms (like the hurricanes) to let you know there may be a delay in shipping.  Makes sense.<br /><br />I believe all the beans are roasted here in the US.<br /><br />Huge fan of Community Coffee.<br /><br />But, I also realize that not everyone will agree.  What i like, you may not and vice verse.<br /><br />My recommendation... buy 1 bag (it's now sold in local stores where i live) and if you like it, then come back to Amazon for more as the prices here are often the best, unless the company is running a special."
Full disclosure I enjoy all kinds of Coffee and don't really consider myself a coffee connoisseur but know what I like.<br /><br />My favorite everyday coffee is probably Dunkin Donuts and followed by Archer Farms which was a surprise to me since it's carried at target.<br /><br />I will try any coffee and this was on sale several months ago and decided to give it a try. This coffee is very smooth and I didn't really need much cream which is a good sign. I like a medium to dark blends so this one falls a little more on the lighter side but wasn't weak. I would recommend this if you like medium blends of good coffee.
This is one smooth coffee. I actually sampled it at Tulane's Homecoming game few years ago. They were out of cream and sugar so I hesistanly tried it black. To my surprise it went down smoothly! Try it black and you'll be in for a nice surprise.
"Large, sweet and soft. I just hope they don't get sold out when I am ready to buy more."
The package I recieved was among the best dried figs I have ever eaten.  I will definately buy these again.
"good quality ,just as described, and it did add a unique falvour to my baked recipes, i like the whole seeds rather than grounded version to have a better and fresh flavour"
"This is a real nice beer. Excuse me, Ale. And what an ale it is! Real rich, hoppy flavor and full bodied. Nice aroma. Don't confuse this with the pale imitations that are sold on most supermarket shelves. Sierra Nevada Topedo Extra IPA is bold! Just look at the alcohol content. It's 7.2 % and that's really up there. Please be careful about drinking this stuff and driving. When you say ""But Ocifer, I've only had two Sierra Nevada Topedos."" you may be legally drunk. Torpedoed, so to speak. But sitting at home with the TV on, it's a real nice brew!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"My daughters ages 6 and 8 love this oatmeal. It starts as little eggs and then when the hot water hits them the egg coating starts to melt and inside is a gummy sort of dinosaur. This oatmeal for some reason is hard to find in the stores so when I found it on amazon I was super excited. However, like a previous reviewer said, when we recieved the shipment, some of the boxes were open and some of the boxes had beeen taped shut with clear tape. I will still keep my suscription but amazon please look into this issue."
"I was so happy to discover the dinosaurs!  My local stores are no longer carrying them, and they are my grandchildren's favorites!!!"
I had a hard time finding this product in stores and just happen to go on Amazon and see if they might have it and they did.  My daughter loves the little candy eggs that turn into dinasaurs in the oatmeal.  It fun to eat and good for you too.
"I have a 22-month old son who loves everything dinosaur.  Including this cereal.  The dino eggs are actually pretty cool... they're basically little pellets of sugar that dissolve when you stir in the hot water.  The outer sugar shell dissolves and what is left behind are these little colorful dino shapes.  There are probably about a dozen or so green, red and orange ""friends"" in each packet.<br /><br />Be aware, though, that you are paying a premium for these little dino eggs.  Each of these boxes only contains 8 packets as opposed to regular Quaker oatmeal that comes 10 packets to a box."
"My grankids LOVE this cereal.  I cannot find it in local stores?  I have told the managers to stock it, so maybe it will start showing up.  It is a great way to get them to eat oatmeal."
We use this cereal at work for our children's menu. It is very hard to find retail. Finding it on Amazon.com was a nice surprise.
"Let me start the review by saying that I have not purchased this from Amazon, so I don't know of any packaging issues that may happen.  However, my review is of the oatmeal itself, not of the seller.<br />I grew up eating this oatmeal, and it is the absolute best.  It's hard to decide whether to leave the dinosaurs in their eggs or take them out of the oatmeal beforehand; I usually take the eggs out, make the oatmeal, and eat the eggs separately (This may not be the best idea, because the sugary ""egg"" around the dinosaur is a large part of what sweetens the oatmeal).  The oatmeal itself is delicious, and tastes very authentic.  The dinosaur eggs were a great incentive when I was younger to eat a healthy breakfast, and they make the entire meal exceptionally better.  Perhaps it's because I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to the dinosaur egg oatmeal, but I absolutely adore these and will buy them as long as I can!"
"I love this oatmeal, I especially like the flavour, which you can't get in the UK, unless you make up your own...I also find this kids' version much less artificial than the adults', but in terms of ingredients, I might have got them the wrong way round on that count! Good size portion and keeps me going until lunchtime. Love it!<br /><br />The dinosaurs are only an added benefit, as far as I'm concerned...!"
"On visits to Grandma when my grandson was 3, he loved to stir the eggs in the bowl and watch the dinosaurs emerge in his ""dinosaur oatmeal"".  He's 15 now, living in another state, and loved eating my last 2 packets when visiting last Thanksgiving. It's difficult to find in NY supermarkets, but I'm prepared for this Thanksgiving visit with an entire case from Amazon."
"This has been a firm favorite at breakfast time in our house for many years. When you can pick it up at this low price for a 4 pack, it seems to taste even better."
My Children really enjoy the dinosaur oatmeal and I was not able to find it in our local store.... I bought several boxes while on vacation in Florida and when we got home I searched the amazon wed site and found it :) I will be ordering more in the future... was very pleased with product and sevice I received. Thanks
"They haven't sold this awesome stuff in my area since I was 10 years old. Finding it here for so cheap, I just had to get some! It sure brings back nostalgic memories for me. New time tryers may not enjoy it, as it is just simple brown sugar oatmeal with cheap candy pieces. But hey, I loved it as a kid, I love it now, and I am sure kids today may love it as well!"
"I remember eating this when I was seven, I loved it and was so excited to be able to eat it again."
My grandmother use to make this for me when I was little.I love it so much.I have been searching for 11 years for this oatmeal.I am 17 and I adore it.It's my favorite thing from my childhood.
"My kids love this ! Whoever invented this oatmeal was a genius. The eggs do look like eggs when you open the package. After microwaving or adding hot water, you stir and the eggs ""hatch"" You get a variety of different dinosaurs in different colors. I would love to read an interview of the team that invented it. This oatmeal is really cute."
"As the 43rd President of the United States, I often found it difficult to incorporate both oatmeal and dinosaurs into my daily routine.  One afternoon, after a busy afternoon at Chuck E Cheese, Laura dragged me to the supermarket to get groceries.  I'd normally sit in the car with my DS, but decided to venture forth this time.  I stumbled across these bad boys and my life hasn't been the same.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Brown sugar<br />Dinosaurs<br />Ninjas are pretty cool too (not included)<br /><br />Cons:<br />No ninjas"
"I got this 4 pack for $8.10 after a coupon code and I have to say, it's a bit bland, although the dino eggs are kinda cool. Two of the boxes were opening and the other two are part of the pack at the botton side that I didn't open yet but I have no idea why all the boxes are prematurely opening. Something is causing the individual boxes to be open prematurely. Were the bulk packs dropped at some point bursting the seals? There is very little sealing the boxes closed. Just two glue points on either end.<br /><br />My order was bought on the 13th of February and the ""Best if used before date"" is Jun 14 2012. Just called theQuaker and the rep said these have a shelf life of about 18 months and approximated these were just two months old, so good job Amazon. Quaker rep was kind and sent out some coupons and suggested that the boxes should be sealed and under no condition be opened and to make a report with Amazon. Only two of the boxes holding the 8 envelopes were opened. The other two boxes remained closed, no spillage of the actual oatmeal occurred."
"My daughter loves this oatmeal and I was so excited to find it on amazon.  Unfortunately, when the package came today, all four boxes were opened.  Some of the oatmeal was spilled in the box.  I have never had a shipping problem with Amazon until now.  Very disappointed."
"Ingredients<br />Whole Grain Rolled Oats (With Oat Bran), Sugar, Dinosaur Egg Shaped Pieces (Sugar, Dextrose, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean and/or Cottonseed Oil, Maltodextrin, Confectioner's Glaze, Magnesium Stearate, Soy Lecithin (An Emulsifier), Modified Corn Starch, Red 40 Lake, Yellow 6 Lake, Yellow 5 Lake, Artificial Color, Blue 1 Lake , Bleached Beeswax.

"I am deeply disappointed that Quaker would add ""dinosaur eggs"" candy with partially hydrogenated oils to kids oatmeal.  Very shameful.  Save yourself big dollars and buy bulk organic oatmeal from any supermarket and add your own brown sugar or maple syrup.  Better for you and much, much cheaper."
"I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the old addage is true:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, has a low almond content, and is flavored with a hint of citrus that masks any almond flavor whatsoever.  I may as well have been eating lemon-scented glue sticks.<br /><br />Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety.  Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later.  They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.<br /><br />I will never buy cheap marzipan again, and I have thrown out the bulk marzipan that I purchased from this company."
"I bought this candy as an early Valentine's/Birthday present for my husband.  I realized when it arrived that 2lbs? Yeah, that's a LOT of marzipan.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, it is DELICIOUS! We opened the box up right away and dove right in. The candy was finely ground, without a grainy texture we've found in some other candy.  It was nicely sweet and intensely almond flavored.  Even my picky two-year-old tried a piece and asked for a second.<br /><br />To prolong our enjoyment of the candy, we froze two of the trays and are quickly working our way through the third."
"I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little ""flats"" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough."
"I ordered these last Christmas to wrap up and give to my parents as a gift. The box I received was fresh and in good condition. The marzipan themselves were delicious, and there were enough for the whole family to share. I think these little gems will become a regular addition to our holiday celebration."
"My grandmother used to send packages every year when I was a child and since her passing I have ordered on line for several years now. These were the best price I have been able to find .I ordered 2 boxes and couldn't wait till xmas to open one of them. They are nice and soft,not just the best price, also the freshest I have found and you get twice the number of fruits for the price. I will order from them many years to come."
"This product was a great deal for the price. Ideal to split up and use as gifts for the marzipan lovers in your life (if you can restrain yourself from eating it all yourself).  The candy is colorfully decorated as pieces of fruit and was very fresh.  I would definitely purchase this product again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CINE8A"">Bulk Marzipan 2lbs. 72 pcs.</a>"
"I ordered this box of marzipan mainly for use as edible cake decorations for holiday desserts at the museum at which I work. These little candies are nicely sized and colored, and the almond flavor is pleasant and not too sweet. Good value for the money and delivered exceptionally quickly; I probably will be ordering from this company again, both for my own use and the museum's."
"This candy is wonderful, and I will be re-ordering soon. I would encourage at the very least that if you have not ever had Marzipan this is a great time to try it. If you have had it  in the past, jump in and enjoy it again."
My mother loves Marzipan and I try to get it for her every Christmas. The couple of stores that have it locally are always over priced and the quality isn't that good. I've ordered online previously but it wasn't great quality. This Marzipan is really high quality at a great price and fast shipping to boot! Highly recommended! :)
"I don't consider myself a food snob by any means, but this isn't the best.<br /><br />The good stuff is a pure almond-sugar paste. This has a slight almond-lemony flavor that's loaded with corn syrup, definitely isn't the real deal. I would imagine if you grew up with this, you may have a nostalgic connection to it; you may like it if you like very sugary-tasting sweets.<br /><br />Personally I'll keep looking. I thought when I found it at T.J. Maxx it was a good deal but it was disappointing. Also, the fruits look dimensional through the box lid, but really they're cut in half. I'd love to be able to find someplace in the U.S. that offers the real fruit-shaped marzipan instead of these expensive substitutes. Bummer."
This Chokecherry tea is simply tasty ..........  I think that pretty much says it all .. tasty.
"These are a great, truly mini version of Breton crackers. A little over 1 1/4 inch in size they are the typical Breton cracker with a subtle vegetable seasoning added. They are deliciously light and tasty while not being salty like so many crackers are.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise they boast 80 calories per serving of 15 crackers. 30 of those being ""Fat Calories"" but with none of that being trans fat.<br /><br />Allergy-wise they contain wheat, soy and milk but are made in a peanut free facility.<br /><br />Made in Canada these are truly great snacking crackers. If you like these I would also heartily recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFAK46"">Dare Vinta Crackers, Original, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> which are also perfect alone or with cheese."
"I was initially nervous about this purchase.  24 cans at such a low price?  However, the beans are good quality. I would buy from Roland again.  My only complaint about canned goods from Amazons is that they usually arrive rather dented.  Wish they'd do more about their packaging."
"Before even opening, I'm trusting its the same product I've know from years back.<br /><br />But the size was a huge disappointment for the money - couldn't find size in the description - and, after the fact, a quick search found this same product available at nearly a third the price from a few other outlets.  Personally, I think it's outrageous but don't have the time to do anything about it.  Funny, though, how it's sold in Amazon's ""Super Saver Center.""  Hah!<br /><br />One star, based on value."
This is a wonderful product. The coffee as well as the aroma are enticing and satisfying.<br /><br />The challenge I've encountered is obtaining it at a reasonable price. It's often offered at a premium vis-a-vis comparable items. Hopefully that will change as supply meets what must deservedly be rising demand.
I cannot drive at this time so getting my groceries on Amazon is so convenient for me.  Amazon is amazing - there are very few things you can't get on Amazon!!  This is the 2nd time I have ordered this soup and I am addicted to it!  Amazon is THE BEST!  So is the product!
"We have enjoyed Millstone Coffee for years and until receiving our Keurig for Christmas, only drank Millstone Hazelnut Creme. (See my review for that coffee).<br />But now, we have discovered another joy by Millstone. Breakfast Blend is a light roast coffee which is what we enjoy drinking. It is a great cup of coffee to wake up with. It is not bitter and does not leave a bad taste.<br />Like Hazelnut Creme, I only wish it was easier to purchase. I wish Amazon would routinely carry this coffee with Prime."
This K cup breakfast blend is one of the best I have tried for that first morning cup.  The flavor is full body and does not kick back like some brands that are too strong and give acid reflux.  This coffee is really smooth and nice without that over bold taste kickback.  Every cup had been very consistant and dependable. If you like morning blends you will be thrilled with this one.
I was surprise at the smooth light coffee flavor.  Good cup for later at night when you want a cup of coffee without staying up too late...
"The coffee is actually very nice, but the price is way too high. I just bought a box for 7.99 for the 12 pack which means 3 packs would be @ $24.00. this is no deal"
I can get 3 boxes of this at my local grocery store for under $18.00 ($5.89 a box) don't know why it is so expensive here.
The is blend we tried and my hubby and I love it.  Are second favorite is Cappacino.  I would recommend
I do not like my coffee bitter but I also don't like it to be tasteless either. I have tried so many different brands of coffee for my Keurig and this is my favorite. It's not bitter and has a nice smooth coffee flavor. Just an all around good cup of coffee.
"Price it on here and then price it at Wal-Mart.  You'll get it cheaper at Wal-Mart for the 36 count.  I found that out the hard way as I ordered them from here in Afghanistan for my wife in the states thinking that it would be nice for here to have a ""stash"" of K-cups around the house.  Not everything on Amazon is cheaper..."
"I'm a morning coffee drinker and don't usually drink the 'strong' stuff, so this was just what I needed to get may day started: not too strong and not too weak."
"This Breakfast Blend coffee is very mellow and satisfying! It makes a nice companion to, or just a little change up from my favorite Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast blend! It also comes at a decent price per cup!"
I've tried about 30 varieties and this is one of my everyday cups. This actually tastes like Folgers which I also like but this is cheaper. I think in fact they make this? I use the 10oz setting on my Keurig and this is just right for me. For those who like a strong cup then they might want the smaller setting. I have had a few guests ask me what kind of coffee this was as they really liked it. Must be a low acid blend as it never upsets my stomach even after 5 cups. Very smooth taste. I'm not a coffee connoisseur but after tasting so many different K-cups I can tell you this one is one of the best.
"I love this coffee in my Keurig all throughout the day. It has the perfect taste for our family, it really hits the spot. I've ordered well over a hundred cups of this blend and hope to continue to do so for many years to come."
"This is a delicious light roast blend of coffee and in my opinion is the closest I can get to a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee.  I have consumed well over 100 of these K-cups and the flavor of eack K-cup is consistently the same.  Additionally, the price of this item is just about the same as or better than you would find in any retail store where I live."
"This coffee is the greatest.  It is full flavored, yet it is not bitter.  It is just smooth and full of just the right flavor for a great cup of coffee."
This coffee is the smoothest one I have tried.  It is gentle on my stomach.  And it tastes good.  I will certainly buy more.
We LOVE Millstone coffee and were thrilled to find it in Kcups! This is our favorite blend!!  If only it were on special more often ....
I am glad I found this product at Amazon.com.  The coffee is delicious and so was the price!!  I get tired of paying $1.00 a cup or more for some of those other expensive brands!  Thank you Amazon!  Keep up the good work!
This is a very smooth coffee that doesn't upset my stomach as most coffees do.  Have become a millstone breakfast blend for life fan.  Best coffee I have ever had in my keurig!!!!
"This is one of my favorites to use with my Keurig. Since I'm not a fan of bold and bitter coffees, I love that Millstone is smooth and balanced. It has lots of body. But I thought the price was good--I live in Atlanta and can't seem to find a box under 10.99."
"This is great coffee.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I seem to love a light roast that feels ""thick"", and doesn't have a bitter aftertaste.  Millstone is the best I have found.  It's smooth and doesn't feel watery.  What I don't understand is how it can sell for over a dollar a cup.  That's twice the price at a local store, and there are so many kcups at this price on this site.  Are there that many fools and lazy folks out there to keep this ripoff going?  Local stores sell for 55 cents a cup before tax and coupons.  Maybe this fits people in remote locations, but it sure is expensive.  They must make more off you folks than if they sold more cups at a lower price."
"Don't buy Millstone in the K-cups! We've used Millstone coffee beans for years. In my opinion, it's the best you can buy. I thought the Millstone K-cups for my Keurig would be just as good. They aren't. Maybe the coffee that I got was old - it tastes old - but whatever happened between Millstone and my coffee maker ruined the coffee. I bought two boxes of this at a ""special price"" and am stuck with it since you can't return food products to Amazon. This is the worst cup of coffee I've ever had from a Keurig. It doesn't even smell good. Stick with Tully's or Green Mountain."
"This Millstone Breakfast Blend falls into the medium-light roast category; however, I wouldn't go larger than a 10oz cup for this categorization.  The blend is what I'd consider a typical Breakfast Blend - good as a compliment to your meal.  The taste isn't bad, but it also doesn't have an outstanding flavor.  It doesn't have a bad flavor either, although there are slight hints of bitterness (not a gut tearing bitter, just a whisper of bitter, which a splash of cream/milk would override).<br /><br />For a medium coffee, I'd rank <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZB2"">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> slightly higher on the preference grid.  However, given coffee prices and Amazon specials, if price were an issue, I'd be happy with any of these three choices."
does the info mean 3 boxes with 12 in each for total of 36 or does it mean you only get 12 total??  why no free shipping on it when it's over 25.00?
"I just bought six dozen Millstone Breakfast Blend Light Roast K Cups and am having a problem. Water does not come out of the cups I have tried. The machine works fine with other cups however with the new cups out of the batch I just bought water does not come out of them.  Best if used by Feb 11, 2013  2138725  PL054  14:48  is on the back of the box.  Since AMAZON will not accept food products for refund or replacement.  I guess I am out $43.92 with no recourse.<br /><br />UPDATE I contacted Keurig, they sent me credit for the defective K cups.  It seems Keurig buys coffee from coffee companies and they put it into K cups. Any problem with getting the coffee out of the K cups is Keurigs job to solve."
"I ordered this on February 18th and have yet to receive despite 'in stock' status. I dont see any link to contact with regard to the order, so I thought I'd write a review. Perhpaps I'll see them by summer!"
"Well, I can't really critique it, I placed an order back in February when it was a special on Deal of the Day and have yet to receive it. My order keeps saying Not Yet Shipped. It is clearly in stock so I don't understand why they don't ship it."
"My kids and I LOVE this drink!  It is relatively healthy and my 11 yr. old chooses it over a soft drink, which I think is great!  Will say this though - VERY disappointed with the shipping! I ordered 3 cases that came in 2 separate boxes. Opened the smaller box first and didn't open the 2nd one until today.  A bottle in each of the 2 cases had somehow leaked.  One bottle was completely empty in the first case, the other was about 1/3 empty (but won't use it because of this!).  Was a big mess too!  Needs to be packaged better - no packing peanuts or bubble wrap, just the 2 cases stacked on top of each other!!  Wish there was a way to let them know too!  Anyway, love the product, just hope it arrives better next shipment!"
My whole family loves this flavor. My husband adds it to his tea. It should be available in stores. It is better than everything else out there.
"Black Rasberry flavored ICE is my favorite drink by far.  It has no calories, a great taste and I love the carbonation.  I rarely drink anything else and my husband laughs about this - what would I do if I had no black rasberry ICE in the house?  The answer to that question is that I'm never without it!  I'm not fond of the other flavors and recommend that you try the black rasberry first and if you like it (and I bet you will) stick with this flavor."
Ok I have tried alot of 0 calorie drinks before.<br />This has to be one of the best.<br />Hard to believe it has 0 calories and no carbs.<br /><br />Even though I got free shipping on this...I have found it cheaper at Walmart.<br /><br />Love the product!
Sparkling Ice Red Raspberry is like crack. I can't get enough of it. It is cheaper to buy this product from Amazon rather than from a grocery store. Amazon rocks!
I love this drink for many reasons.  One of them is because there is no aspartame in them!!  No calories! And it tastes great!
"I've been drinking Sparkling Ice Black Raspberry for several months and LOVE it.  I used to drink diet sodas, maybe 2 big gulps a day, but my dr. warned me about putting all those chemicals in my body.  I tried other drinks, sparkling water, flavored water etc.  When I read the label on Sparkling Ice I was delighted - no calories and it has antioxidents in it too.  I hope they keep making this stuff forever!"
"Not too long ago I discovered the ""Sparkling Ice"" Lemon-Lime drink and enjoyed it very much. Next, I tried the Black Raspberry flavor. I like it even better. Mmmm, good. It's ever-so-slightly carbonated with a nice fresh flavor. Goes down easily. One surprise is that it somewhat sweet. Sweet. Hmmmm. I looked over the ingredients at the suggestion of a reader and there's no sugar but it evidently has an artificial sweeteners in sucralose, perhaps it's also getting it's sweetness from the blackberry juice concentrate. Which brings up an interesting point . The drink is called black raspberry, but raspberry is not listed in the ingredients. Blackberry is listed. No matter, really, the main thing is that it's a quite good fruit-flavored drink essentially free of calories and  I enjoy the very low sweetness.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"I tried the black raspberry flavor along with the orange mango and pomegranite berry. Although I also like the orange mango, this one blows the others away. It has a nice fruity flavor that reminds me of raspberry jello, and with added carbonation I feel like I'm drinking a soda, without the calories. Highly recommend!"
"My husband luvvvs this flavor; I like it, but find it a little too sweet. Then one day my mad-scientist mate poured leftovers from three different flavors together, and the tartness of the Pink Grapefruit and Orange Mango offset the (for me) slightly cloying taste of the Raspberry.  I'd still rank it, along with my preferred flavors, much higher than any other soda, diet or otherwise, out there."
What a refreshing tasting beverage...Unlike anything I have tasted before....The juice and carbonation mix great together...
"Don't get this even on your hands, it's ridiculous.<br />No reason to use coloring that is this harmful to clothes and floors and rugs."
GLAD THIS APPEARED ON THE MARKET.  FANTASTIC TASTE NOT OVERLY SWEET BUT ENOUGH TO SATISFY<br />THE SWEET ATTACK. GLAD THAT THE FIZZZ WAS ADDED.  IT TOPS OFF THE GREAT TASTE.  GLAD AMAZON IS<br />OFFERING THIS PRODUCT.
I really liek the raspberry flavor and it is really great on a hot day.  It quenches your thirst and has that refreshing taste that I like and enjoy.
VERY REFRESHING WITH NO LINGERING AFTER TASTE AND HEALTHY FOR YOU AND INVIGERATING AND LIKE SPARKLING SENSATION AND BETTER SERVED COLD
"VERY TASTY! Totally Delicious! Subscription of this flavor or other ICE beverages is easy and convenient; delivered to your door to be put directly into the refrigerator.  Best of all, buy the subscription plan, it is less expensive than ANY store even if it is on sale.  This flavor is delicious and my favorite, but other flavors are equally as good."
"I am a physician and a patient with diabetes first recommended this product to me.  I have had at least 6 of their flavors and have enjoyed them all, especially Black Raspberry, Pomegranate Berry (no longer available from Amazon), and Harvest Peach.  So much flavor and so few calories.  A great product."
"This is my favorite flavor.  I tried others, but this one is the best.  It is not only healthy, but has no caffeine, no sodium, no sugar, etc.  but you feel like you are drinking a soda.  I order it by the case from Amazon, as it is least expensive and arrives right to my door and I don't have to carry it out to the car."
"This is my favorite zero calorie drink! Of all the Sparkling Ice flavors, this one is the best. It doesn't taste diety or weird. And, I LOVE it because it has some fizz to it, and best of all there's no aspartame!"
"LOVE this stuff! I just recently tried this flavor. It is by far the best of any that I have tried. It tastes like soda, not like water. My kids love it too. The lemonade, grapefruit and orange mango are also good....but this one is amazing! The only one I haven't cared for is the coconut pineapple."
I have been purchasing this drink from my local supermarket for almost 1 year.  I have tried all of the flavors offered but black raspberry tastes the best.  Amazon's price is better than the local store and it is delivered to my door.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P02EGU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
What I like the best about this product is that it does not contain caffeine yet still has that great fizz to it.  A great and refreshing drink on a hot day!
I have tried both the Black raspberry and the Orange/mango and loved them both. I didn't care much for the pineapple/coconut or the Strawberry one. But the Black raspberry and Orange are both a great addition if you want something other then regular water but don't want pop.
"who knew zero calories can be this good? overall, I am impressed but it's just not always at the ""right"" price."
"This stuff MAY be habit forming for you, too! I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this flavor (and most others, too -- but this one is my favorite!) and sure hope it's in stock more...I've been without this one for MONTHS!<br /><br />Don't know what it is about this flavor that makes me crave it the way I do, but it's awesome! You've been warned ;)"
"This product is my new favorite drink. I buy so much of it, and it's heavy to carry. I thought it would be easier to get this way. The flavor is sweet and sparkly. There is no aftertaste. GREAT!"
"I have to say, this drink is probably my 2nd favorite of the Sparkling Ice line-up (the first being the Coconut-Pineapple) and it is very delicious.  As a away to quit drinking soda, I've been looking into healthier alternatives, and the Sparkling Ice brand is one of the brands I've found to try out.  And I've enjoyed almost all of them.<br /><br />Black Raspberry tastes exactly like black raspberries.  It's a little bit sweet, and has that tangy raspberry in the sun flavor.  And the aftertaste is just the same as the original taste so you don't have to worry about a shock of sour or other weird flavor.  It also has carbonation so you get that pleasant fizzy feeling on your tongue while drinking that makes soda so popular.  One bottle is pretty large too, 17 ounces, and I've found that it will get me through most of the morning at work, although it stops being cold after awhile, but hey, it even tastes decent warm.<br /><br />The ingredients are pretty good too.  With the exception of the sweetener being sucralose, which I'm not crazy about, they have green tea extracts, actual raspberry flavors, and spring water listed.  And the list is short compared to a lot of drinks out there.  It may not be the healthiest, but it's not as bad as soda either.  And it's still 0 calories, which for a flavored drink is pretty good.  They also put in a few vitamins to the mix, such as B3 and a some other B vitamins so you can pretend you're drinking something healthy as a result of that as well.<br /><br />I will keep buying these drinks as a soda replacement.  They're reasonably priced and taste good and make the no-caffeine transition easier.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
Love this stuff. What nice alternative to soda and/or plain water; with the bonus of no calories. Haven't tried a flavor that I don't like.
I really enjoy drinking these. They help me get past my craving for a soda. They have a great flavor.
I really like the black raspberry alot - I personally like to mix it 50-50 with fruit juice (almost any flavor). Our favorite ICE though is the lemon-lime. I'm going to take it out on the boat this summer as I think it will probably make a pretty good margarita!  always thinkin'...
"I was introduced to this beverage by a family member. Being a person who has to watch their sugar intake, I was delighted to discover this beverage and even more excited to find in on Amazon. It has a light refreshing taste and it does not taste overly sweet like other diet drinks. The beverage also has a lighter carbonation then soda pop.  Additionally, this beverage  contains vitamins and Green Tea. There are several flavors available, but my personal favorite is the Black Raspberry. I just ordered another case of the Black Raspberry and a case of the Pineapple. I cannot wait to try the Pineapple."
My husband teases me when we see these on sale at the grocery store.  I LOVE this flavor so much more than any of the others I've tried.  It has just the right amount of carbonation for that soda fix and the flavor is fantastic.  I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon and the subscribe and save price - much better than I could ever find in the grocery store.
"My husband and I have tried this product and we love it. However, we bought it at Costco in a variety pack. I didn't care as much for the other flavors and wanted only raspberry. When I found it here on Amazon I was excited :D BUT when I tried ordering it, it turns out this is the ONLY flavor that does NOT ship to Hawaii. Hence, the three stars. Love the product, hate the stupid shipping >.&lt;"
I found this on my local store grocery shelf but it is much cheaper on amazon.  I really like this stuff - not your regular sparkling water.
"OH my gosh is this stuff good.  But open it slowly and carefully, or the top 1/5 of your bottle of red colored black raspberry will fiz out all over you!  (even when it hasn't been shaken or stirred!)"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P02EGU"">Sparkling ICE Sparkling Ice Black Raspberry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>  I found Sparkling Ice by chance when a friend offered me one.  It was so refreshing, with just the right amount of fizz and the perfect amount of calories: ZERO.  My local grocer could not keep it on the shelves because of its popularity, so I went to Amazon and found that I could have my Sparkling Ice delivered to my doorstep every month and at a cost that was cheaper than what the grocer charged.  Win - Win!  Sparkling Ice is offered in many flavors which are just as tasty but I got hooked on the Black Raspberry.  Try it and you'll be hooked too."
I like product and couldn't find it in stores anymore so was glad to<br />find it here and I enjoy it very much
This is the best tasting of all the sparkling ICE waters.  It also takes care of my soda desires.  I stopped drinking so much soda to lose some weight and this helps with that.  I also like the idea that there are no calories.
"sparkling ice is awesome,thanks to amazon i can have it when i want because it not available everywhere,,,thx<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P02EGU"">Sparkling ICE Sparkling Ice Black Raspberry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>"
I tried this product on a whim.  It tastes great.  No Calories.  Includes vitamins and anti-oxidents.  Does not get much better than this.
I just received my black raspberry sparkling flavored water today and I love it!!!!  It has just the right amount of sweetness and it tastes very good.  I have tried many flavored waters and this is now one of my favorites. If you like the taste of black raspberry then you won't be disappointed.
"I used to be a big fan of the Sparkling Ice drinks.  They taste pretty good, made me feel good and were all natural - or so I thought.  Although their target audience seems to be healthy, active adults, which is why it's a naturally flavored vitamin drink, they use artificial colors in all their drinks.  To me, that's the big flaw.  I've decided to stop drinking Sparkling Ice and start drinking other naturally flavored vita-waters that are also naturally colored.  I hope that Sparkling Ice will someday make its drink ""all natural"" so that I can start drinking it again."
"Sparkling ICE Black Raspberry Mountain Spring Water would be great if they stayed with the natural ingredients but they add Red Dye #40, Potassium Benzoate (a chemical preservative) and Sucralose (which  makes it super sweet and leaves a funny taste in your mouth). I NEVER would have purchased this item if I had known what they actually put in it. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I won't ever purchase another Sparkling Ice product."
Packing is a fail.  2 bottles out of my 12 were busted cracks along the bottom of the two broken.  I'm not sure if they just got roughed up and broke or if they froze somehow.  Nothing frozen on delivery.  They don't appear cut though.  Looks like there is no way to recover the loss no return options.  The drinks that did not break taste great and all.  But without me seeing away to get credit or anything other than taking a loss this wont be worth trying again.<br /><br />The package was the 12 bottles shrink wrapped then tied in an industrial type garbage bag and then placed in a box that was a good deal larger than the bottles with no packing material.  The bag worked for stopping the liquid from leaking into the box.  Out of the four beverages I ordered from amazon this was the only one with broken containers and the only one packaged in this fashion.  Its as if it was packed to fail but also packed well enough to contain the liquid from ruining the rest of the package and containing the surprise for me!
"When opened box, one of the shrink wrap packages was already opened, looked like cut with knife, and one of the bottles was cut and water is everywhere, sticky sticky sticky.  We have ordered this before without issue, but now washing all the bottles and have empty one, so less than ordered.  Can't return, so guess out, see if Amazon will do something here....Won't hold breath."
I love the orange/mango and the lemon/lime flavors.  They are very refreshing.  This flavor tastes like a bad lollipop. Don't recommend it to anyone else unless you like the taste of candy in your drinks.
"I grew up in Indiana eating black raspberries.  They are my favorite fruit in the whole universe!  I moved down to the Atlanta, GA area two years ago, and no one here seems to have any idea what a black raspberry is.  My daughter came home very excited and couldn't wait to tell me what she had found -- TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Black Raspberry drink!  We were both so excited we could harly stand it.<br /><br />We bought some and couldn't wait to drink it...  MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  This is NOT black raspberry -- it's a mixture of red raspberry and black berries.  That was a dirty trick!  :(<br /><br />So sad.<br /><br />Yes, the drink is very yummy, but it tastes NOTHING like black raspberries."
"I found this drink to be somewhat refreshing. As one reviewer remarked, however, this does not provide a true black raspberry flavoring. I'd say that it more closely resembles a blackberry, boysenberry, or black currant flavor. In any case, it's fairly quenching. If it weren't so sickly sweet, I probably could've given it four stars."
"This beverage is ok.  The stats are good, but the flavor is really off on my palate.  It does not taste anything like berries to me, it tastes like apple juice?!  I hate apple juice.  The color leaves crazy stains so sip carefully.  I like the orange mango flavor from the store, I had an issue with taste from an amazon order but they made it right.  Taste one from store before ordering a ton of them here!"
"This flavor is a little too sweet for me.  I prefer something a bit more on the tart side.  My biggest complaint is no matter how chillled the bottle is and how little you move it, the stuff comes squirting up out of the bottle when you open it.  So beware."
I had some of these sent to my travel destination as I couldn't buy them in that state. I typically buy the 1 liter bottles in the store.  The 17 ounce bottles feel flimsy and just don't feel right when you are drinking them as they are skinny.  So I don't have a problem with the actual water as it is still good just the bad packaging on the single serving size. They need to sell 20 ounce just like everyone else.
"The taste is good but this water and this brand's other flavors all stain incredibly badly. I have now spilled on three shirts at work, all from a single pack bought at Costco. No other flavored water I have ever tried have had this incredibly annoying ""feature""."
These chocolate bars taste great!  We also received them in perfect condition (chilled box) all the way in West Africa.
"This is the typical tobiko you have at any Sushi restaurant. It was fresh and delicious. I used it on homemade sushi, eggs and salads. I loved it!"
"Why, oh why, oh WHY?! Don't we have such great tasting crisp like these in the USA!!! Walkers produce AMAZING crisps! 'Lays' can't stand up to the deliciousness that is Walkers. Please Walkers, start importing these into America! At least teach your parent company PepsiCo how to make great snacks so they can in turn teach the Americans how to make a great crisps!"
"walkers crisps are so very good, bacon is my particular favorite. they are not at all greasy like some of our American name brand chips. the bacon flavor is just great. highly recommend these."
"Starbucks call it French Roast, I call it a very fine Cup of American Coffee. smooth, the beans are a bit oily, which give it a strong taste of roast, feeling the smoky taste but without any distinguished taste!<br />I usually drink it in the morning, or early afternoon. I realized it doesn't stain my white mug as the other coffees do.<br /><br />once you start drinking it, you might never stop! very addictive, but great!<br />I love it<br /><br />Take the empty bag to a local Starbucks for a free tall brewed coffee!"
"Along with Seattle's Best brand, the preeminent French roast coffee sold in the US, imho. The 20 ounce bags are about the same price or a little less than the grocery price ... and then there's the free shipping too. Can't go wrong with this offering. The local Fred Meyer sold this item (and the organic SB alternative) for $5 less per bag a few weeks ago, but I can't get them anymore locally, so Amazon it is.<br /><br />These larger bags are great for travel -- I take along a French press coffee pot and anywhere I can get boiled water I can have a nice cup of fresh and steamy French Roast, no electricity needed. French roasted coffee is dark, rich, fragrant, and robust -- all with less acidity than most other coffees, and it is good for your liver too, but most of all, ""yum""."
This is our favorite coffee! It is very rich and it is so convenient that it is already ground. I love mine halved with skim milk but my husband likes it black. We go through about a bag every 1.5 weeks. Beware though!  Visitors often find this coffee way too strong.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the price is so high here. My local supermarket and W****** carry this for half the price posted here. I would love if Amazon had a subscribe and save option with more reasonable prices.
"What can I say. This is the real stuff. Dark, full flavored and strong. If you don't like coffee this is not for you."
"Starbucks French Roast is one of my favorite for its bold and distinctive flavor. It is a dark roast and works best if you desire bold or strong coffee. I have tried many other ""french roast"" blends but can taste the huge difference in this one that leaves others lacking. As much as I love it, it is impossibly expensive coffee. I used to buy it from Amazon and Amazon itself used to carry the 2 20-ounce bags for under half of what it is now selling for. The closest thing I have found is a Starbucks roasted sold from Costco in their own brand. That is a solidly good coffee and great price if you can buy it in the store. I wish Amazon would again carry this coffee for the price I was used to. It was great."
"Love this rich brew by Starbucks, and you can't beat the Amazon prices...so much more economical than relying on the the chain grocery store in my neighborhood!"
My wife and I like a coffee that has a bold taste. This is my favorite coffee.<br />I wish Starbucks had this coffee in a decafinated coffee.
"Good decent coffee..not the best. You can get it for 19 dollars at Costco. Same amount, same coffee."
I was so glad to find this on Amazon! I had purchased several cans through Whole Foods and they discontinued it but I wanted nothing else. It is delicious paprika.
"When I first tried Fazer chocolate, a friend from Finland sent it to me.  I was skeptic about it being the ""best in the world"", but after trying it, every other chocolate out there is a poor subsitute! Fazer chocolate is the best out there period.  Once you try it, you probably won't want to eat any other chocolate, it will only be fazer."
"Karl Fazer ""Blue"" is quite simply the world's finest milk chocolate bar. It is rich, creamy (not cocoa-y and artificial tasting like most American-made chocolate bars) and what a chocolate bar should be. Even though it's milk chocolate it complements a nice pinot noir and holds up well. Fabulous."
"I just have to agree with everyone else that Fazer chocolate is simply the best in the world. And talk about being skeptical about it. The first one I had was from my sister  and it had ginger bread, cherries and almonds in it. And I thought ""What's with gingerbread and cherries in chocolate?""  I thought it was going to be sickening. I could however understand the almond part. Anyway, after a few skeptical bites I was sunk. I now find it hard to be satisfied with any other chocolate in the world, except Fazer. And to this day I am amazed by that since I used to love all chocolate. In a way, I wish I wouldn't have ever had it, since all other chocolate seems lacking now. I was finally able to try the dark chocolate and it's just as delicious as the milk chocolate. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
Incredible. I lived in Finland for a few years and this is the think I miss the most. I wish it wasn't so expensive in the states! The US needs better chocolate.
"Beware - you will love this chocolate.  Not for someone on a diet, because you will not want to stop eating it and before you know it will have polished off the entire almost 1/2 pound ""bar"" of the best plain milk chocolate in the world.  Let it warm in your mouth to soften ... and ... enjoy the bliss."
These are heavenly!  They are one of the best chocolate bars in the world!  My husband is Finnish and we always bring these home with us! I hope you sell them for a long time to come!!!<br /><br />Julie Jortikka
"Fazer chocolate is excellent chocolate...but hard to find. So, I was thrilled to find these bars on Amazon. However, when I received the chocolate, it seemed like it had been sitting on the shelf for a while, and the expiration date was only 6 weeks away from when I received my order, which was frustrating."
"I bought this to put into korean ramen noodles for some texture. I looked around and it really is hard to find this product for a reasonable price. Even the price on amazon seems high. The picture does not do much justice for how much you actually get. One packet lasted me atleast 3-4 months.<br />Lotus Root stops diarrhea, clears Heat and improves appetite. Lotus roots contains iron, vitamins B & C. The rich fibre content of lotus roots stimulates peristalsis and relieves constipation."
"I agree that the price seems high, but the quality is good.  I really missed the fresh lotus that I could buy in the supermarkets in Souther China where I stayed for a couple years, so I searched for the dried ones.  My husband and I cooked about a half a package and ate it for one meal.  So personally I think the packs are small.  But worth the money if you love lotus root!"
This product is a great value for a hard to find item. The quality is good. Follow the directions for an excellent addition to soups and salads.Thank you.
"I happen to love Lotus Root; stir fried, boiled, or baked.  The Eden Lotus Root, dried, is a completely different story.  I can honestly say that I was so excited to open the package tonight that I overlooked how small the packages were for the cost.  That is until I opened and took a bite.  HORRIBLE is too kind of a description.  Save your money!  Now, I will go on to say that Eden usually has great products and I am a huge fan of many of the offerings but if you see these, just say NO!"
"To my surprise, Folgers Black Silk is bold and flavorful.  I'll definitely buy this product again. It's also just as good if you make it from grounds."
The purchase of our Keurig coffee maker included samples of various coffees.  This Black Silk was our favorite. My husband and I both prefer stronger coffee.
"One of my guilty pleasures has become a little less guilty . . . Post has added a source of fiber to bring the suggested serving up to 4 grams.  Yeah!  Malt-o-Meal and I believe Kellogg's brand is still down around 1 gram of fiber per serving.  It's still pretty sugary, though, but as a late night dessert it beats ice cream!  Have always loved this cereal."
"I have enjoyed this cereal for years. Unlike many 'fun' cereals it has a lot to offer both in nutrition and fiber content. I often treat myself to a cup, which is 4 grams of fiber."
"Who doesn't love chocolate? Who doesn't love chocolate milk? :) And when the two comes together in a tasty breakfast cereal, what's not to love?<br /><br />Breakfast IS the most important meal of the day so you better eat right.<br /><br />One thing though... I don't know why anybody would want to buy this online. It's comes out to 5.42/box (free shipping). I paid $3.49+tax at a local store."
Don't know why this is here as I never purchased this item.
"I use a tablespoons or two of tamarind paste in Indian and Thai dishes - it adds a distinctive sour flavor to Asian dishes. Tamicon brand tamarind paste is concentrated and keeps for up to 6 months in the fridge after openingm making it a good bargain here on Amazon.<br /><br />It's very sour, so don't eat it out of the container.  It's meant to be added to other foods."
"I needed tamarind to make a copycat version of the Cheesecake Factory avacado dipping sauce.  This wasn't the exact product called for, however it was great.  I couldn't tell the difference between my version and the original.  Anyone who needs Tamarind flavoring should use this product without hesitation!"
"I've been eating tamarind and tamarind paste since I was 3 years old, I ordered this product and was really excited to taste it. My tamarind paste came in the mail today, and once I put it in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. Honestly this is the worst tamarind paste I had ever tasted in my life :("
I use this in my cafe and it is a great price. The flavor is terrific and it is easy to use in my recipes.
I love to cook good food and often lack the time to go to specialty stores.  I needed tamarind paste and the dearth at my local spots led me here.  This product arrived quickly and worked perfectly in the recipes I wanted it for.  Large quantity for a very reasonable price.
"These are great crackers, but you can buy them at Whole Foods cheaper than at these online prices.  Last week I paid $3.79 per packet in the shop, do the math.  I thought it might be cheaper to buy them in bulk, but it's more expensive!  The crackers rate a 5, the price here not so much!"
"These crackers are great with cheese, with soup or with salad. They are a substantial cracker that will hold the press of your knife to spread butter or soft cheese.  I am never without these and the black sesame variety of this brand as they are also gluten free. My guests rave about the nutty flavor and want to know where I get these crackers."
This Tazo tea is a most refreshing  and relaxing drink.  I drink it hot or cold and enjoy it three or four times per day.  It is probably my favorite of all the flavors of Tazo.
This is my favorite tea!!  Sometimes it is not so easy to find out in the market place - but thank you......  I found it here.
"For years I have loved the ""Reeses Pieces sundae"" that is served at the Friendly's restaurants. However, the price of that sundae has risen sharply through the years. I've always wanted to make this sundae at home, but finding the peanut butter topping that Friendly's used has been the issue. I finally located this peanut butter sauce which is excellent. I am on my third jar of the sauce, and actually purchased two jars this time. Just remember to thoroughly stir the sauce before using, as the oil migrates to the top of the jar and the sauce thickens on the bottom. And enjoy!!!"
"I have bought this stuff before, and it's the same every time. It has the viscosity of motor oil, yet tastes like the best peanut butter you've ever had. I don't know of any other product locally that offers this (although I bought from amazon, the company is in my state), so it's even that more pleasing to know and have.<br /><br />Best thing to indulge it to grab a graham cracker and dip it in!"
We use to purchase Garlic Expressions Vinaigrette at our local grocery store but for some reason they are no longer carrying it.  It is the only salad dressing my family will use!  we love the clean taste and use it on everything!
"This is made with canola oil and so the saturated fat is very low. Add it to Hellman's Canola Oil mayonnaise (also very very low in saturated fat); start mixing it and taste until you get just the right caesar salad dressing taste you want, with the right viscosity. It's still going to be very low in saturated fat and definitely lower in calories than standard caesar. It's tasty...."
"Muy recomendado para comer una deliciosa ensalada, realmente me gusta mucho &eacute;ste producto. El sabor al ajo es el justo ni mucho ni poco."
"This is the best and most versatile commercially made dressing/marinade I have ever used.  Perhaps the secret is the cider vinegar; whatever it is, it pairs perfectly with any green or vegetable salad.  (It's dynamite on a Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, onion, and feta cheese).  A little goes a long way, which keeps the calorie count lighter, too.  I have used it as a chicken marinade--scrumptious."
"A great combination of good taste and good nutrition. I offered these to my family members, and the disappeared quickly.  All of them liked the taste, and the vitamin C came in handy during this cold and allergy time of year. When I first looked at the package sent to me, I though it was an energy bar.  I figured I would have to divide it up to try it on more than one in my household.  But I was delighted to learn that it contained individually wrapped candy like pieces.<br /><br />Recommended."
"When I first popped the candy into my mouth, I seem to be able to taste honey, even before the liquid honey center flows out. Looking at the ingredients; there are sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin b6, b12 and C. It does not list the percentage of sugar versus corn syrup versus honey. The distinguishable factor is the liquid honey center. But how much of that is pure honey I do not know and can only ponder.  To me, it is just another candy."
"I've liked Honees for a long time, but rarely see them in gas stations or grocery stores.<br /><br />These 'energy' Honees supposedly have B/C vitamins in them to give you an energy boost. I'm not sure I noticed a real boost in my pep when I had these, but I'd still buy them anyway if I saw them in the store. Why?<br /><br />Because I like honey, and Honees have actual honey in them. They're both richer and mellower than almost any other candies you'll see at the grocery store or gas station. I find the flavor soothing and more enjoyable.  With their honey content, you could also treat them as cough drops.<br /><br />If you're looking for an interesting and unusually flavored candy, check these out! You can get energy/vitamins from them too, but I wouldn't buy them on that alone since you should be getting your B and C vitamins from fruits and vegetables already anyway."
"I'm not sure how ""good"" these really are for you, but when you need a little something sweet they are just fine. The honey flavor seems very authentic. My wife enjoyed them so much that she got most of the pack Amazon had sent us to evaluate under the Vine program.<br /><br />Just remember, these are still basically candy and should be enjoyed as such!"
"I received a sample of this candy through the vine program. I chose it because it had the word ""Energy"" in the title, and there are some times when I feel like I could use a boost. Those times are not frequent, mind you, but it's nice to have something on hand when you want it. The first night I tried this candy was on Halloween, as I escorted my children through the surrounding neighborhoods with some other parents. I popped on of these in my mouth, as did another parent I had offered it to. We both thought the taste was good (if you like honey, you'll like these, for sure, as that's all you can taste), but neither of us felt any sort of energy boost as we spent a few hours walking around. My wife tried one the next day (thought it was a bit too sweet) and said she felt a slight energy boost. I had another one the next day and offered one to a co-worker, who accepted. As before, neither of us felt any noticeable bump in out energy levels. Maybe the energy boost is psychosomatic? You WANT to feel it, so some people decide they DO feel it? I don't know. For me, it just boiled down to this being a good-tasting candy that had slightly more dietary value than most candies. Would I buy it in the store? Probably not."
"I like the taste of these honey drops. They are just sweet enough, and make my throat feel good, after a day of teaching.  But I really do not feel any noticeable difference in my energy or alertness level, after using them. So enjoy them for what they are, but take the product name with a grain of salt."
"I've used honey cough drops in the past and was pleased with how soothing they were and these too were pleasant to use.  One of the main differences is these contain some key vitamins, plus after using it for a while, the honey will burst out of the shell and surprise you with a coating of honey.  This fun part could entice kids to use these too and get the benefits of the vitamins and honey, which can be very helpful to soothe a sore throat on the go.  Individually wrapped, these are handy throw in your bag and found that the wrapping is sufficiently easy to unwrap, especially since other similar products can be hard to unwrap without getting fingers sticky."
"These do taste pretty good (I really like the honey taste of them!), but they DID NOT give me any added energy.<br />So if you're looking for an energy increasing product, you might want to look elsewhere."
"I have been on something of honey jag this year.  It seems to find it's way into everything around me from baked goods to bath products.  Honey is better for you than the vast majority what it there.  (I discovered, just a day or 2 ago, when perusing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> that it is not quite what I had believed to be (being composed primarily of glucose & sucrose: sugar).  It is, however, natural and at this point in time that means a lot!  Honees have been around a long long time and are still being made with natural ingredients.  Most of the product is honey and sugar (not high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavoring).  The Honees ""energy bar"" is basically the same as Honees candies but with the addition of vitamin B10, B12 and Vitamin C.  I have another honey candy on subscription now, in large part because I like them ;) but stocked up before my kids went back to school and started bringing home the usual colds and flus.  They made a great cough drop, are very soothing, and mildly antibiotic.  So, the addition of B & C vitamins was a good idea.  It gives this an extra boost for fighting off coughs, sore throats.  Unfortunately there is not enough information in the description or on the package to know how much in the way of vitamins it supplies (relative to the US RDA).  I would not treat this as a vitamin, or vitamin substitute, and have no idea where the ""energy"" comes from, other than the sugar (though that is the #1 source of energy for both plants and animals ;)  )<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars only because having comapared them, I still prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4JEXS"">Cedrinca Miele Honey Candies, 5.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>  Both of these candies are basically honey wrapped in a sugar shell.  The Cederinca has proportionately more honey, less sugar, which has much to do with my preference.  If you have a sore throat, cold, etc. the Honees might have a slight edge because of the vitamins, but that said, I suspect there  is not much (and they are not making any claims as a nutritional substitute, which is nice to see).  In fact, just days after these arrived, my son came home with a sore throat, so they are being put to use (though I did manage to nab a few for myself).<br /><br />Wholesome natural candies with a little extra,  recommended as a (comparatively) healthy treat or for dry or sore throat, cough... (note I am recommending them, not the manufacturer.  I do not want to mislead people).  On the whole these are better tasting and better for you than the average candy, or cough drop (but I am still going to keep my subscription to Cenrinca).  Which you prefer depends on your relative preference for honey or sugar.  The Honess have a thicker sugar shell, the Cedrinca have more honey."
"When i got these, I basically looked at the picture and thought it was granola bar.  Turns out this is a jolly rancher sized and textured candy with the only difference being a soft/chewy center filled with honey.  Very sweet, to the point of making me want to drink.  Otherwise pretty good.<br /><br />I do not at all believe it boosted my energy, however.  Let's face it, it's supplemented with easily attainable water soluble vitamins that are excreted when in excess, which means that if you eat like a normal person and/or take a vitamin pill, this will do nothing for you but give you a boost of sugar and for a little while, at that."
"I don't know about the energy claims, but for as sweet and easy on the palate as these drops are, I will continue to enjoy them.  The center is liquid and when you get to it, it doesn't just ""dissolve"" but kind of coats your mouth and throat.  The first time I tried one, I thought they would make a great throat lozenge. The upshot is that they don't taste at all medicinal, either.  For the Vitamin B content they contain, I was expecting these to have some bitter aftertaste, or at least be less tasty. Liquid B vitamins are ATROCIOUS, but these were quite pleasant. I give them 4 out of 5 stars only because they claim to give a boost of energy, which I have not noticed. If you're getting these based on that claim, you may be disappointed. Having said that, I take B vitamin complex, B6, and B12 every day, so I may have a higher threshold for the ""energy"" those vitamins typically provide.  Overall, an enjoyable little drop!"
"The Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey flavored drops are really just another candy. The touted vitamins B6, B12 & C are in such small amounts that it takes three 20 calorie candies to get 100% of the recommended daily requirement.<br /><br />The candies are reasonably flavorful and the liquid honey center is interesting though reached too soon. They're not overly sweet and the honey flavor a nice change of pace. The ingredients are: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Honey and the Vitamins. There appear to be no preservatives or artificial flavor enhancements. Each package contains (9) drops and weighs 1.58 ounces. These candies are manufactured in Italy.<br /><br />One word of warning; After being in your mouth for a while these become incredibly sticky. If you wear dentures or have bad teeth caution should be exercised while consuming.<br /><br />I felt no energy boost from the B6 & B12 vitamins even after eating several of these candies. The addition of B6, B12 and C appear to just be a hook to draw in the health conscious. In the end, this is just another candy product and nothing more."
"For all practical purposes this is a hard candy filled with some honey. The first 3 listed ingredients are Sugar, Corn Syrup and Honey. How much ""energy"" that would provide at 20 calories per lozenge is arguable. It does however taste fine -  a distinct (as to be expected) honey flavor!"
"Because my job involves talking all day, and I am constantly surrounded by allergins, I go through cough drops like mad. The way I see it, if you are going to consume something, you might as well enjoy it. Ambrosoli-HoneeEnergy Plus more than fills the bill. I found it to be very soothing, but also had a strong honey flavor that I absolutely LOVED!<br /><br />The very best review I can offer for this product: I am about to order it again, and will be back for more."
"When I looked at this product, I was anticipating a candy equivalent to Red Bull. I did not find myself getting an energy boost from these, certainly nothing compared to a Coke. However, for 20 calories, this is a tasty way to up your vitamin  B and C levels, which helps both with mood and with immunity.<br /><br />If you're looking for an energy boost, these candies probably aren't it. But if you're looking for a candy treat that does more than rotting your teeth, having one of these a couple times a day is a tasty option."
"I like honey, preferably in small doses, and Ambrosoli Honees' Energy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops fits the bill.  After allowing one of these drops to dissolve in my mouth for just a few minutes, I was given a small punch of pure honey from the center of the drop.  The taste was very good and just sweet enough to satisfy.  Being real honey, just know that if any of the outer candy coating is still in your mouth, the honey will adhere it to whatever tooth happens to be closest!<br /><br />These drops claim to give you a bit of energy as well, but I found myself wanting in the ""energy"" department.  Each drop contains about a third of the daily recommended amounts of Vitamins C, B6, and B12, which means you would have to consume three of these drops in order to get the full ""energy"" effect.  With only nine pieces per pack, though, you're really only getting three ""energy"" servings as compared to the nine servings listed on the package.<br /><br />If you enjoy the taste of honey and like a little touch of it every now and then, these Amrosoli Honees Energy Plus drops are perfect.  If you want a boost of energy, however, you might want to chase your honey drops with a Monster, Red Bull, or Rockstar.<br /><br />Recommended only for taste."
"I love energy gels, chews, powders, etc. I sometimes take them even when I don't need to, just because I like them that much.  Being an ""endurance athlete"", I have conditioned myself to not run, ride or swim w/o some sort of fast acting carb source and fluids along for the trip.  I popped one of these before my lunch run last week and took off.  I was pleasantly surprised to feel a nice steady energy level for the entire 40 minutes.<br /><br />The good:<br />Quick uptake of simple starches (read SUGAR) for energy.<br />The liquid honey center tastes like....honey.<br /><br />The bad:<br />It's mostly sugar.  I expected to crash from it at some point, but ironically, never did.<br />The liquid honey center tastes like....honey.  Yes, I put that as good and bad.  It was cool at first, then made me want to vom.  Too sweet for my tastes.<br />After you've had it in your mouth for awhile you crunch it up into a sticky, unchewable, knifelike projection that you end up spitting out anyway for fear of stabbing your tongue or choking on it during bouts of heavy breathing."
"These were very good tasting and packed with honey!  Be good to have when you have a cold or a sore throat--plus, they are filled with vitamins.<br /><br />Nice alternative to cough drops!"
"I love the taste of these candies. They have a hard outer shell that tastes like a butter toffee and a liquid honey center. I wanted to try one in the afternoon when I was really dragging at the end of a work day (4:30 - 5:00 is when my energy seems to be at its lowest). While I really enjoyed eating the lozenge, I didn't notice any burst or spark of energy. Nothing compared to a cup of coffee or tea. I did only eat one and not three consecutively, so maybe if I had eaten more I would have felt the charge. My grandchildren all loved them and hey, there's nothing wrong with candy that contains some vitamins. I didn't have a sore throat, but I bet they would be soothing because of the honey and vitamins. I would order these again; not for the energy aspect but the delightful taste."
"Ambrosoli-Honees EnergyPlus honey-filled drops. A honey-flavored hard candy  rectangles on the outside, with a small honey filled center. Overall, they taste good - a honey candy. My 8 year old son has taken a true liking to these candies and I've gotten to like them too.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin B6, vitamin b12, and vitamin C. Each caffeine-free drop is 5 carbs, 0 fiber, 5 sugars, and 20 calories. Serving size is 1, but 3 drops are needed to get the 100% DV of vitamins B6, B12, and C.<br /><br />EnergyPlus tastes good - there's no doubt to that. They have good ingredients like honey and vitamins, but also contain not -so-good ingredients like sugar and corn syrup. These drops are likely good for on-the-go activities or to soothe a mildly sore throat."
"The packages as shown contain 9 individually wrapped drops that look like cough drops. The list of ingredients includes sugar, corn syrup, honey, trace amounts of vitamin A and vitamins B6-0.66mg, B12-2mg, and C-20mg each at what is claimed to be 33% of the recommended daily dosage; three drops providing then the listed minimum requirement. The drops contain no protein, no sodium, no fat, and no fiber<br /><br />The amounts of vitamins C and B6 are so minimal as to be hardly worth mentioning; the amount of B12 is phenomenal if their information is correct. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg daily and the label claims 2mg or 2,000 mcg per drop or 6mg or 6,000 mcg with three drops. I suspect there's a typo there and it should read 2mcg, not 2mg since B12 is usually measured in mcg.<br /><br />In summary the drops are small and convenient, but expensive. If the B12 value is correct it has huge quantities of that B vitamin; other than that the cost is hard to justify."
"The packaging for this says it is an ""Energy"" + ""Vitamin"" drop, and according to the ingredients, that is correct.  However, after eating my entire package (over two days) I can't say that I have experienced any sudden bursts of energy; but I can say that the drops worked very well for me as a cough drop.  First, the flavor of the hard ""shell"" tastes exactly like natural honey, not the ""honey flavor/menthol"" flavor of some honey drops.  After allowing the drop to melt in your mouth there is a center of thick, pure, tasty honey inside.  These drops taste great, and they calmed my scratchy, allergy induced, cough faster (and with a better taste) than the usual ""medicine tasting"" cough drops). 3 drops contain 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamins C, B6, and B12, so hopefully with continued use I will see an increase in energy due to the B vitamins."
This is a healthy treat from Italy that comes with benefits:  They taste great and they are high in B vitamins and Vitamin C.  For a little boost or a little treat these just can't be beat.<br /><br />Try them and you'll be hooked.
"I thought these would be a soft, chewy type of product, but it is a hard candy in texture. It tastes very good, the honey is very predominate. The fact that it has some energy boosting vitamins is a very nice touch, and doesn't distract from the pleasant taste at all.<br /><br />I would have a couple of these a day when I was getting a little slow. These and a few diet cokes can keep me going throughout the day or help in some of those late night gaming sessions as well.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in these, but them now!"
"not sure how much energy it really gives you. I know that natural honey is recommended in many home remedies...both topical and for internal purposes. I use honey as a sweetner and I no longer buy sugar.<br /><br />I like these drops...it held me over until dinner when I had 2 of them after lunch. But, I didn't feel any extra burst of energy.<br /><br />Inspite of that...I will still purchase again."
I don't know if it is right saying a sweet candy can be a 'engery' booster. I think this is more of a candy with a feel good label on it. As long as you don't question the labeling you might feel less guilty eating this candy.<br /><br />Happy Shopping!
"These candies were good. I'm not saying they weren't sweet. But they didn't give me any energy that I noticed. I enjoyed them, but can't say I'd go out of my way to buy any on my own, and it certainly wouldn't occur to me to recommend them to a friend. Relatively mediocre."
"When I was a little girl at sleepover camp, my great-aunt would send me hard candies. My favorite were the honey flavored ones that had a center of soft honey.<br /><br />These Honey candies are very similar--hard with a soft splash of honey in the middle. I could not tell any increase in my energy after eating an Ambrosoli Honee Energy Plus candy, but they are delicious. I would not recommend them for people with dentures or bad teeth as the hard sticky bits can make your mouth a bit sore.<br /><br />But for a girl looking for that honey flavor again, these are spectacular!"
"In a world full of energy drinks, red bull and others, plus coffee and other stimulants to wake you up this product seems like it would have a market...however....<br />I tried it and had others try it as well.... so here are the good things and the bad things:<br /><br />The good:<br />- These are more like lozenges so if you are sick or feeling under the weather they might help.<br />- I like the fact that it has vitamins.<br />- Not much more....<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Bad taste...i am not a big honey flavor kind of person but even other people disliked  the flavor.<br />- No energy boost<br />- Even with vitamins I would prefer to take a supplement instead of these.<br />- Did not like and did not do what was expected....sad but true but hard to compete with all the hardcore ""energy"" products out in the market."
"I loved the taste of this product. When you first put it in your mouth, you get the taste of solid honey. When you reach the center, you get a drop of real, liquid honey. Whether it boosted my energy or not, I can't say, but it sure tastes great."
"Ok, I have to admit I was a little intrigued by the concept of this candy.  Well sorta candy, I'm not sure what you would classify this product as.  It claimed to give you energy and it was made of honey, that's actually pretty neat and healthy sounding.  That being said, there were a few things that just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The drop is basically a hard candy coating wrapped around liquid honey, or what I'm assuming is the honey in the product.  This honey has a very sweet medicinal taste to it and the outside coating is exactly like a hard candy.  Right down to the stick on your teeth and be impossible to get off aspect.  The inside did taste better than the outside coating and had a lot richer flavor to it.  But alas, that sensation didn't last very long as there wasn't very much in there.<br /><br />I didn't experience any uplift in energy at all from this product.  But I did find it good as a sort of cough drop.  It definitely eased my coughing back when I had a cold.  This product also dissolved pretty well into hot tea to help soothe the throat that way too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the ingredients lift.  Corn syrup was featured pretty prominently with honey coming in listed after that.  So there wasn't as much honey as there could have been in this product.  But it also had some vitamins thrown in and the ingredient list wasn't that large.  So it came out ok all in all.<br /><br />I don't see myself getting this product too much unless I'm sick.  Its ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011"
"This product had a pleasant, not too sweet natural taste. Although I enjoyed the flavor, I cannot speak to its energy boosting properties. I really did not get a large pick-me-up."
"Perhaps I did not read the description fully, but I expected some sort of energy bar when I ordered these, and was somewhat off-put to receive lozenges. Confusion aside, while these purported 'energy plus' hard candies don't appreciably uplift any lethargy - at least not for me - they are tasty little drops which release a sweet shot of honey when dissolving. Calories are 20 per piece; most ingredients hold negligible nutritious content, although Vitamins C, B6 and B12 each provide 33% DV.<br /><br />Nice to have in purse or backpack for a hungry moment or oral fix."
"I like the regular Honees and keep them around for cough drops. These are similar; hard honey flavored candies with a liquid honey center, these also have a hint of lemon.  Not much, just enough to make them taste slightly different from the originals.<br /><br />Because I have celiac disease, I contacted the company by email to find out the status of this new product, and, like their other Honees varieties, they said one is gluten free too.<br /><br />I was not impressed with their ability to provide energy.  I noticed no energy boost even after consuming three.<br /><br />They claim to contain vitamins, which is great, but they don't really contain that much.  For the price difference, I would prefer to stick with the original flavor and get my vitamins elsewhere."
"This fresh honey energy candy is quite good tasting. That's exactly what it tases like, - fresh honey.<br />I like the fact that each drop contains 1/3rd the daily value of vitamins B6, B12, and vitamin C.<br />The benefit of 'brain food' is something you don't normally get in a candy.<br /><br />There are 9 peices in each packet, one box contains 24 packets.<br />That's 216 peices at the current price of $27.69 = 12.81 cents each drop.<br />That figure seems quite a reasonable amount for a candy that's for the most part healthy.<br /><br />After using one pack of 9 peices I can't say I noticed any energy 'boost',<br />but this product is certainly worth using in place of junk candy,<br />which will leave you with a very noticeable energy 'low'.<br /><br />This candy deserves 5 stars for it's taste and healthful properties.<br />In other words, 5 stars for NOT CONTAINING --<br />Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Omg, and Sodium.<br /><br />The one point I wonder about is, this candy is made in, and imported from Italy.<br />For those who use honey regularly you likely already know that,<br />studies have shown that honey harvested the closest to where you live is more suited to nourish your body.<br /><br />Having said that, I still feel it's a great little snack, and a pretty good cough drop too!"
"Why does Ambrosoli-HoneesEnergy have ""added"" Vitamins with the first DOMINANT ingredients being SUGAR and CORN SYRUP?<br /><br />With the natural antioxidants, enzymes, vitamins, and energizers provided by bees through [[B003SO9QZA: RAW]] honey, it is questionable why this processed food was heated with contains added stuff.<br /><br />In fact, the package arrived sticky with the liquid honey dripping out of each plastic-wrapped candy, which made each piece icky to open.  Nonetheless, after reading the ingredients - with honey being the third after sugar and corn syrup, we decided to recycle this treat with our friendly outdoor insects in the yard."
"These Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey candies were two thirds of a disappointment.<br /><br />The product as described on the packaging and as described on Amazon makes three claims, and only one of them met my expectations.<br /><br />1. One claim is that it will in some way make you more energetic.  The fact ""ENERGY PLUS"" is by far the hugest lettering on the package, almost to the exclusion of everything else, is one example.  The manufacturer's use of the phrase ""Instant Honey Energy,"" whatever that means, is another example.<br /><br />2. Another claim is that the product contains three particular vitamins.<br /><br />3. And a third, implied, claim is that these candies are pleasurable to eat.<br /><br />Let's examine those three claims in reverse order.<br /><br />3. These candies are pleasurable to eat, at least compared to, say, a multi-vitamin.  They are sweet, of course, and there is a distinct flavor of honey on the outside as well as in the more liquid center.<br /><br />You should be aware that after enjoying three or even one of these candies your teeth will be covered in a sticky, tacky, gummy substance, which will be even more of a problem if you have dentures or a partial plate.<br /><br />2. The product does contain three vitamins as claimed, those being B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), B12 (cobalamin) and C (ascorbic acid).<br /><br />I ran a sample of one of these candies through a 1996-vintage mass spectrometer I have in my basement, and all three of the named vitamins are present as advertised.  But you probably wouldn't want to use these candies as a substitute for a simple multi-vitamin.  The generic Wal-Mart knockoff of Centrum Silver, for example, offers significantly more of these three vitamins than one of these candies, although it doesn't taste nearly as good.  Note that the packaging says you get 100% (presumably of the Recommended Daily Allowance, or RDA) of these three vitamins only if you consume three of them.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />-------- 1 Multi-vitamin --- 1 candy --- 3 candies<br />=====================================<br />B6 -------------- 3 mg ---- 2/3 mg ------- 2 mg<br />B12 -----------25 mcg ----- 2 mcg ------ 6 mcg<br />C ------------- 60 mg ----- 20 mg ------- 60 mg<br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />More important, of course, is that a multi-vitamin supplies maybe thirty other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Which is not to say you should substitute a multi-vitamin or any number of these candies for a healthful diet, which will contain all the Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 you need.<br /><br />Anyway, the point is that the fact three of these candies supply 100% of the RDA of three particular vitamins should be of no consequence in your decision whether to buy the product.<br /><br />1. I don't understand the various versions of the first claim, which is that the product somehow supplies special energy to your body.<br /><br />Remember ""ENERGY PLUS"" and ""Instant Honey Energy""?<br /><br />First, and this is purely subjective, I never noticed any increase in my energy even after consuming as many as five of these candies at once, so you can imagine how little an increase in energy I noticed after only one.<br /><br />Second, trying to be more objective, it isn't clear to me which ingredients of this product are even supposed to increase my energy.  The three most prominent ingredients are sugar (which is, well, sugar) and corn syrup (which is sugar) and honey (which is sugar).  To the extent the sugar in these candies increases energy, so does any other product containing the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />Third, if all you want is a jolt of energy, drink a cup of coffee or some other substance containing caffeine.  Caffeine indisputably makes most humans noticeably more ""energetic"" till it wears off, as do certain other not-necessarily-legal substances, not that I would know from personal, subjective experience, mind you, it's just what I've read and stuff.<br /><br />For the questionable advertising, trying to trick us into buying a product we might not buy if we knew all the truth, I subtract two stars.  If you're looking for an instant burst of energy or a vitamin supplement, this is a poor choice.<br /><br />If you're looking for a honey-flavored candy, this ain't bad at all as long as you remember to brush your teeth afterwards."
"Does this item have honey? - Yes, and lots of it! If you love honey, you will love this product.  It's good to just melt in the mouth till you get to the honey core.<br /><br />Does this item contain B & C vitamins? - Yes, but not as much as you would think.  You have to swallow three drops (yes, count them... three drops) just to get 100% of your daily value of the B & C Vitamins. So yes, technically the vitamins are there, just not in the quantities that you would be led to believe by the front of the package.<br /><br />Finally, Does this item give you energy? - No not really, not at all! At only 20 calories per drop and most of that from sugar, corn syrup and honey it gives you about as much energy as a regular hard mint candy. The vitamins are dosed in negligible amounts to really make any kind of difference. I ate six drops at once and no energy boost at all.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want a honey-candy product this is for you.  If you are looking for an energy boost, keep looking because this product just doesn't pack all the goods that it promises in the title."
"Many people feel a ""boost"" from vitamin B - hence the energy boost claim. I felt no extra energy, but they are a good craving kicker.  I kept a pack in the car and was driving around - was in a hurry, skipped breakfast. Had a few of these and they took the edge off.  The description calls this a ""bar"" - it's not a bar - it's a pack of a dozen or so individually wrapped pieces. Each piece tastes like and resembles a hard candy shell with a gooey honey filling. Tastes like honey - I like sweet, and these are very sweet.<br /><br />I can see these for a carb-fix while on the trail or even skiing, as an alternative to a granola bar for example. For taste and as a treat - perfect. For energy? Not so much."
"When a product has honey or vitamins in the title or description, people automatically think healthy.  These are not healthy at all and do not provide any extra energy.  They are full of high fructose corn syrup. It is easier and healthier to eat a spoonful of raw honey or take vitamins in pill form. Will not be buying or recommending to anyone."
"I got one small energy bar instead of a whole box,I just don't understand what's 'pack of 24' mean?<br />But I should say the flavor is okay."
"These are individually wrapped hard candies with a gooey (not exactly liquid, but soft) center. They're about the size of a Jolly Rancher. The outside tastes pretty much exactly like honey. The inside also tastes like honey, but with a softer texture. If you're the impatient sort that likes to chew your soft-centered hard candies, get ready to enjoy a very, very sticky coating of honey on your teeth for a while.<br /><br />I didn't notice much energy. I mean, they're pretty small candies, so the sugar involved is not enough to offer much of a perk, and the vitamins didn't do anything noticeable for me, but I already take supplements. Still, if you're looking for a sweet little pick-me-up while working, this might help. Note that the candies don't have any caffeine, like I often expect from something claiming to give ""energy."" :)"
"Ingredients list:<br />Sugar, Corn syrup, Honey, vit b6, vit B12, vit C.<br />1 piece = 20 cals.<br /><br />Packaging:  Easy to open and pop a treat in your mouth.  The hard candy shell keeps things neat and is easy to pop out of the wrapper.<br />Taste:  Pretty good, the outer shell is a like a sweet hard candy, then when you get to the middle, the honey flavor really comes out.<br />Claims:  The energy boost you get is probably just a boost of sugar, rapid up and down.  The vits you can get from a well balanced meal or a real supplement<br />Overall:  Just think of this as honey candy, ignore the the fluffy stuff."
"I have found that these are a great way to eat something before a morning workout. I'll eat one or two before I run and fortunately they do not upset my stomach. The outside is a hard, candy-like shell and on the inside is honey. I wouldn't recommend as a primary source of energy for workouts longer than say an hour because it wouldn't be enough to sustain you, but in the morning when you need ""something"" this seems to do the trick for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that if I were to take these on a bike ride, they would be too difficult to open while riding, not to mention the fact that the shell is hard and I prefer a soft shell when I'm eating while exercising."
"I enjoyed the Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel energy thingies (could they please come up with a longer name?), but I probably wouldn't buy them.  While they do contain vitamins, I'd prefer to just take a vitamin.  I didn't feel particularly energized either, although again they're reasonably enjoyable.<br /><br />They're not great and not bad.  If you like honey, you might like these.  I can't really see a great demand for these, but I'm sure someone will love them.  I prefer the non-carmel version to the carmel Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin things."
"Pretty tasty, not really mediciney or gross at all, plus a nice kick of multivitamins. Dissolved a couple in hot tea and that wasn't bad either. Not quite Ricola with echinacea, but not bad! Individual wrappers were a little hard to get off."
"The wrapper says, ""Energy Plus Honey Filled Drops""......do they actually give the recipient 'Energy Plus'?  I don't have a clue! What I do know is that they tasted good and when I received the package I had a sore throat and by the time I had finished the package it felt much better, which might have been a result of the honey and the sweet, soothing taste of the product.<br /><br />I think it is a bit expensive to gobble down like candy such as I did and it would be much more practical to carry it in a car or handbag for an occasional pick-me-up, but however you choose to eat it, it tastes great!<br /><br />I loved the hard shell and then the liquid center!"
"Conceptually, this is a great idea and is likely spawned from the popularity of gummy vitamins. I really liked the flavor of the candy. The honey center was amazing.<br />My big beef with this product is twofold: 1) Where's the energy boost? 2) Where's the vitamin goodness?<br /><br />These candies don't contain any substance known to boost your energy in the dose included in the candy. This seems misleading to me. Nor does the claim of vitamins really stack up. It takes ~2.5 candies to get your daily vitamin requirements, and that's just for B and C vitamins. What about all the other vitamins you may need? Well you're on your own. On top of this, this candy is loaded in corn syrup...yuck!<br /><br />I can't completely dislike this product, because they are delicious. I'd just recommend you treat them like the candy they are."
"These things are virtually tasteless; sorta sugar with a slight honey aftertaste. Nothing I'd choose to snack on. So far as energy goes, I felt absolutely nothing, even after taking two of them (I subsequently threw the rest of them out). The ingredients are sugar, corn syrup, honey, vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin C, in that order, so I doubt they can be horribly good for you either. Granted you could take three per day and get your recommended allowance of the three vitamins (for 60 calories), but why would you want to? Definitely not something I'd ever buy again."
"This product is marketed not as a candy but as a vitamin and energy booster. In reality it is a honey candy; it's first two ingredients are sugar and corn syrup. Three drops equal 100% of daily requirement of B6, B12, and C (at 20 calories each). And I suppose the B vitamins are what warrants the energy boost ( I noticed no such effect).<br /><br />As it is honey, the packaging was pretty sticky and a couple drops had to be discarded because I could not peel the plastic wrapper off the drop.<br /><br />The take home message is that  if you like honey then this is good candy for you. If you are looking for vitamins and energy, look elsewhere."
"These Honey Flavored Hard Pieces tasted okay if you like honey. Actually, I used them when I had a sore throat and thought the honey filled center soothed my throat for a time. But, as far as giving any energy goes, I noticed no difference in my energy level anytime I took one. In fact once I ate two in a row, and still no difference. I think they should repackage them for sore throats :)"
"I was looking for a fun way to get the B vitamins so decided to try these out. Glad I did, they're delicious! All natural ingredients and real honey! Highly recamend to anyone who likes the taste of real honey."
"I tried these and they taste great. They are a honey flavored hard candy that claims to have B vitamins for a boost of energy. I never felt a boost of energy, but I had to restrain myself from eating a whole pack at a time for fear that I might overdose on B vitamins. I have never gotten B12 shots, but I have friends who swear by them. These candies did not give me anything like the boost they claim to get from the shots. I think that I preferred the honey candies over the caramel slightly, but both are good."
"I'm not sure that anyone is getting any nutritional benefit from these, but they taste fine. The honey center seems to be pure honey, which is nice--kind of like sticking your finger in a honey jar. The outer part of the candy gets very chewy once it starts to melt, so if you have delicate dental work (or braces) don't chew one of these--seriously, you'll regret it. But taste wise, they're just fine. Of course, if I had them on my desk, I'd go through a box in a matter of hours, so that's probably not a great idea for me! Funny, but I remember a candy like this, with a honey center, back in the 1970s, I just can't remember what they were called."
I don't know what the word 'energy' is supposed to refer to unless its the sugar. But as far as hard candy goes these are very good. I am a very big honey fan and so enjoyed these. But they aren't going to replace the Five Hour Energy in your desk drawer quite yet.
A great and delicious thing to have around the house when you need either a pick-me-up or have a scratchy throat.  It's all honey with liquid honey in the center.  Loved it and will buy.  Strong recommendation!
"The list of ingredients goes like this:<br />1. Sugar.<br />2. Corn Syrup<br />3. Honey<br /><br />Needless to say, it's all this candy is, and it has way more sugar and corn syrup than it does honey - to keep the cost down obivously.<br /><br />I am giving it 2 stars, because despite all the sugar it doesn't taste terrible and they tried to include vitamins and didn't use high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I wouldn't give these to a kid though, might as well chew on a cube of sugar."
"If you've had the regular ""Honees"" candy before, you will definitely enjoy these. They taste the same but are infused with vitamins C, B12 and B6. If you've never had these before, these candies have a honey flavored sugar shell on the outside and are liquid-honey filled on the inside. If you love the taste of pure honey, you'll probably really enjoy these candies.  I've loved the taste of honey since I could remember, so I really love these candies. I even use honey as a sweetener in my coffee, so I may be a bit biased in this review, lol.  Anyways, there are 9 pieces of candy in each bar, and there are 24 bars in the box. They also have other different flavors such as Caramel, but I prefer this one because it tastes just like the original (which is strictly honey flavored). There's not much bad stuff to say about this except that it may increase the likelihood of getting cavities... it tends to stick to your teeth once you bite into the honey center. By the way, this product is imported from Italy, so it is pretty hard to find in stores.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes very delicious<br />-Each candy provides 33% of your daily needs for Vitamins C, B12, B6.  Eat 3 for nearly 100% :)<br />-Made in Italy.... which automatically makes it cool in my book ;)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-May be habit-forming and addictive, lol!"
"Talk about all natural. Basically this is a drop or splash of honey covered by a thin candy coating. The candy coating melts in your mouth and then comes a rush of honey. I really cannot say that it gave me energy but it sure tasted good and each drop has 33% of your recommended intake of vitamin C, B6 and B12. The product is made in Italy."
"Most health-conscious adults know the importance of the combination of B-Complex Vitamins with C; yet, we also realize that our B6, B12, and C are water soluble vitamins-- meaning that whatever is not metabolized in our systems is lost in our unused fluids, whether it be by urination or perspiration. Some compensate for this loss through time-release vitamins, but there is a concern from some that certain time-release vitamins are not as natural as other forms, not as effective, or not as easily assimilated.<br /><br />Ambrosoli-Honees honey-filled Energy Plus drop provides a tasty and effective alternative to time-release, as well as a natural alternative to the acrid potency of recent caffeine energy drinks.<br /><br />The hard candy exterior is delicious and not so hard that you cannot easily chew one or two up and get to the even more delicious honey center. I weigh well over 225 lbs. so I didn't seem to have the kind of energy surge from only one drop; but two or three drops at my weight allowed me to notice a bit of alertness and energy when my energy levels would have otherwise dropped off. That put me up to about 60 calories at 20 calories per drop; yet, with the energy boost received from the three drops, I know that my activity more than compensated for the caloric intake.<br /><br />One down side to the honey drops is that they may not store too well for long periods of time because the honey might seep through the end of the hard candy leaving you with a sticky wrapper.  For me it wasn't really a bother at all because you're going to get something a little sticky any time you use real honey."
"This candy tasted good. A real honey flavor. The ingredients don't state much honey though, mainly sugar. I liked knowing I was getting 33% of a few vitamins while eating it. I cannot feel any extra energy, but then who feels something when they take a vitamin? I'll tell you who, someone who should be seeing a doctor not eating candy. I take this candy after a meal so I can absorb the vitamins better. Vitamin C and B6, B12 can be taken at higher doses without side effects, so If I take a multivitamin at diner time on top of this, It won't be overkill. While the product stated pack of 24. I only got 1 pack. This is not a reflection on the product, but it may be a reflection of the ordering process of this product."
"Essentially, these are honey drops, that provide you with Vitamin B6, B12, C, and more. I found it to be such an ingenious idea to add more nutritional value to these drops. In a way, it's like healthy candy.<br /><br />Some nutrition facts for 1 piece (5g):<br /><br />Calories: 20<br />Fat calories: 0<br />No fat, sat fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium or fiber<br />Total Carb: 5g (2% daily value)<br />Vitamin A: 1% daily value<br />Vitamin C: 20mg - 33% Daily value - Woo hoo!<br />No calcium or iron<br />Vitamin B6: 0.66mg (33% Daily value)<br />Vitamin B12: 2mg (33% daily value)<br /><br />You can get a good amount of vitamins from just one or two honey drops. Just be a little aware of how much you're having. A little more than your daily intake is okay. Water soluble vitamins, which are the B vitamins, are excreted through urine if there is any excess. There's no real worry if you have more than usual.<br /><br />I love the taste of these honey drops! It's sweet and not to overbearing when you first put it in your mouth.  And as you make your way to the center, honey bursts out. In no time, you've already finished a piece of honey drop. Onto the next!<br /><br />I'm a believer. A great tasty pack of honey drops packed with nutritional value."
I'm not sure what i was expecting but the taste isnt something that makes me want to take another one an the effect of the product isnt anything i felt. unfortunately i would not recommend this product
"I am going to call these candy rather than vitamins simply because the ingredients begin with sugar, corn syrup, and honey.  I received one pack of ten small candies from Vine the week before I did a distance walk.  So I thought it would be a good test.  Each candy is individually wrapped.  They actually have a honey taste with a liquid honey center.<br /><br />After walking about 10 miles one of my walking team was yawning, so I suggested that we try the candy.  Everyone liked the taste, especially the liquid in the middle.  We could not tell that there was any energy boost, but the yawning did stop.<br /><br />There were enough candies for us to use one a day for the next two days, nine in a package.  The company sent one package to vine members.  We never really noticed that they gave us any extra energy, but they were a nice treat.  So as far as being a vitamin, or giving you extra energy, I can't really say that this is a great product, but if you are looking for something that is tasty, this is is.<br /><br />I am going to add something to this review.  I thought about this product in relations to all the other products that are supposed to give you energy while doing marathons, or some kind of long distance exercise like that.  In my experience, none of them work to give you that instant energy boost with the exception of a couple of fruit juices and chocolate milk, and this certainly taste better than some that I have tried.  We did talk about the choke hazard that a hard candy might cause if you were running, but I am a distance walker and don't intend to start running again this late in my life.  So I think that would not be a problem for me.<br /><br />With all that in mind I decided to go back and raise the review another star, they taste really good if you like honey, I think that the sugar gives as much energy as some other products,  and they were easy to put in a pocket.."
"This is a very pleasant hard candy with a liquid center of honey. It has a strong honey flavor when you get to the center. It reminds me of a honey cough drop. You also get a few vitamins. There is actually an error on the label concerning the vitamin content. The label says there are two mg(milligrams) of B12 and that is 33%of the DV(daily value). It should say two mcg(micrograms), which is, indeed, 33% of the DV. Well, nothing is perfect. At least the quality of the candy is fine."
I don't know why some company decided to put vitamins in honey but it is tasty.<br /><br />It is like eating a spoonful of honey except not as sticky.  If you like that you will like these.
"If you don't want to take supplements or open a chocolate bar, these drops provide a quick energy boost. They are low in calories but are just a tad too sweet because of the honey center. I took one in mid afternoon when I began to feel that slump coming on. It subtly gave me more energy without the jitters that caffeine products tend to. I felt good for the rest of the work day. One slim pack fits easily in a small purse or pocket. Each drop is indivually wrapped. If you want an energy boost that does not contain caffeine, I recommend this."
"These ""energy drops"" come individualy wrapped which keeps them from sticking together and messing up your pocket until you are ready to eat it. Great taste, especially when the center liquifies and you get that honey taste. As for the energy, not so much. At least, not for me. Still, it is a good, healthy supplement."
I expected a much harsher taste but these things are pretty good.  Packed with B vitamins it's kind of like 5 hour energy in a chew-able.
"Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass did a song called ""A Taste of Honey."" This is the candy-drop version of the song. Sugar, Corn syrup, honey, Vitamin B6, B12, and C. Simply tasty, melts in your mouth. I don't know if it gives you an energy burst--say, to climb up on your roof and lay a dozen courses of shingles, but it might give you enough of a boost to tackle the client call you've been dreading before you take the next Facebook break."
"Nine individually-wrapped pieces per roll.  The outer shell is hard spun sugar with a smooth texture that develops long grains if you let it dissolve on your tongue .. like those old-fashioned hard candies that your grandma kept in a jar, all stuck together in a huge clump.  Anyway, these are not stuck together; as I said, they're individually wrapped.  I don't chew them.  I let them slowly dissolve.  They taste like honey, or at least they seem to, until you get to the liquid honey center and are reminded what honey REALLY tastes like.  This is the best part, when the honey gooshes out ... but then the sugar shell collapses and the last remaining portion of the candy is very sticky like an old-fashioned toffee.<br /><br />These things are fortified with B vitamins which are supposed to give an energy boost.  I couldn't tell whether it worked or not.  I really didn't feel any different ... but I didn't get tired for a while after eating the candy, so maybe it did something.  I don't know.  It could be a placebo effect because I _expected_ to be energized.<br /><br />Whatever.  At least they taste good."
"Ambrosoli-Honees hard candy drops imported from Italy have a honey taste that is subtle rather than overpowering. The hard outer shells dissolve rather quickly as you suck on them and there is a good amount of liquid honey in the center. The dissolve time is too long to eat as your run, and I prefer gel packets (with caffeine) during a marathon or half marathon.<br /><br />The Honees are good prior to a training run and would be good prior to a race on the way to the start line or waiting for the gun. They have no caffeine so you would not have to cut back on caffeinated gels during the race. It is irritating to have heart palpitations due to too much of the stimulant during the last miles of a long race.<br /><br />The contents are: 5 g of sugars, 20 mg of Vitamin C, .66 mg of Vitamin B6, and 2 mg of Vitamin B12. The quantities of the three vitamins equal 33% of Percentage of Daily Values based on a 2000 calorie diet.<br /><br />The Vitamin C research suggests it is one of the safest and most effective nutrients available in dietary supplements. It is involved in protection against immune system deficiencies (my interest), and prevention of cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />Vitamin B6 is involved in several metabolic processes. It facilitates amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. It plays a role in neurotransmitter and histamine synthesis. It is also involved in hemoglobin synthesis and function, an interest of mine because blood work shows a tendency toward anemia.<br /><br />Vitamin B12 is important to me because I and other seasoned citizens may have a deficiency in it, and it is important in energy metabolism. Experimental studies suggest it may have no beneficial effect on performance in absence of deficiency. I can tell a difference in recovery time after a run of 6 or more miles when I eat a Honee drop before the run. I do not experience as much of a decrease in post run energy level as I do without the drops.<br /><br />My subjective feeling may be a placebo effect, but it is still a real feeling. The next time I have blood work, I will see if the Honees plus other vitamin and nutritional supplements have made a difference in some of my low normal readings. For now, I have no adverse effects of the drops (1 per day) and do believe run recovery is facilitated by them."
"This is a very convenient pack of candy that is filled with honey.  Initially, hard handy has zesty filling and as it is melting in your mouth it's inside starts releasing sweet and dense honey.  For people with dentures, this may not be the most pleasant candy to have because of its stickiness.  But natural honey and selection of vitamin B definitely has its advanatages.  I carry these in my purse and I usually have one a day."
"I had traveled across several time zones to visit family and had this shipped to that destination to await me. Although this is not a sugar-free treat, it certainly eliminates any guilt because honey is a natural antibiotic, and it is a great way to get some more energy, B and C vitamins, and zip into your day. It prevented fatigue for a while, which with my busy schedule, I need! Plus we are coming into flu season, I had a bit of a bug, took this after I recovered, and although this statement has not been evaluated by the FDA, I felt better. the taste is terrific--you have to prevent yourself from chewing too soon, i recommend sucking and letting the flavor expand a bit."
"I guess there are vitamins in there, but it seems to me that this is candy.  I love the flavor and the chewy little honey nub inside.  However, I am not sure I get an energy boost anymore than I would with a regular piece of candy."
"Delicious and basically pure honey. B vitamins normally upset my stomach but clearly the honey provides just enough ""cushion"" to avoid gastric issues. I also noticed a discernable bump up in my blood-sugar when I take these in the afternoon which was a good caffeine-free boost to kick the afternoon drowsiness that hits me between 2-3PM.<br /><br />Only one problem: the candy shell is fairly fragile and the candy leaks, honey being sticky - well you can figure it out. This isn't the kind of product you can just pop in your purse without making a mess.<br /><br />Still a good product & one I intend to keep using."
"These things taste great.  I like the honey taste; not too strong and not to subtle.  Plus, I've found they sooth a dry, scratchy throat.<br /><br />I liked that the lozenges are individually wrapped.  That may be required to keep them from sticking together and nice none the less.  The only problem is resisting the temptation to bite down 'cause the liquid honey center, when chomped on, makes everything stick to my teeth for a few minutes.<br /><br />Amazon VINE was nice enough to send me one pack for free.  I just got done ordering a carton."
"These little candies have a sugary outside but a rich honey inside. The inside is like a burst of liquid honey and its quite tasty if you like honey. I don't really know how much energy you get just by taking one of these. However, they supposedly have vitamins, so if you do want candies these seem like a nice choice."
"I wouldn't call these Hard Candies exactly healthy for you nor should you expect a burst of energy after taking one. On the other hand, if you like hard candies and like the taste of Honey, then you will love these. And they will actually be better for you than the average sugar sweet hard candy. These Ambrosoli-HoneesEnergy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops do have Vitamin B6,B12 and Vitamin C content such that 3 of these Drops will give you 100% of your daily requirement. But the best part is that these Drops taste really great. They taste like Honey and have a nice Honey filled center. They are not too sweet and dissolve readily. However, if you buy these expecting a big burst of energy after taking one Drop, you will be disappointed. I didn't really notice any significant increase in energy.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to keep your throat from drying up then these Ambrosoli Drops will definitely do that. If you want a hard candy or hard drops that taste really great but also are better than the average hard candy then try these Ambrosoli-HoneesEnergy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops. Highly recommended."
"If you love honey, you will love these bite sized drops of delight. Do they give you energy? I have no idea. Do they tast great and have a liquid true honey center? Absolutely and they are delicious. I received mine free through vine and immediately ordered more."
"I'm always lloking for the next best vitamin.  I'm someone who, when taking vitamins, tastes them for days after.  So if I can find the right way to take them that might eliminate this, well, why not?<br /><br />The Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey tabs are sweet.  If anything, they are sweeter than honey (yep, that's possible, much to my surprise) and delicious.  I can't speak to the vitamin side of the tabs, as I could not detect any taste of vitamin in them. But they did taste good and the soft (not liquid as I though from the ads) center only made it that much better.<br /><br />I highly recommend these.  Very good!"
"I'm not a big candy eater any more, but if I do eat something sweet, I would prefer it have some nutritional value.  These candies are high in sugar, but they are also high in vitamins, so just having one isn't going to do any harm.  I didn't feel any increase in energy from eating these, but I honestly wasn't expecting to.  They do have a very good flavor, especially the real honey in the middle.  This is definitely something I will want to buy again in the future.  The only negative is that the candy melted a little and some of it leaked out of the inner wrapper.  That was a bit of a turn off, but it didn't affect the taste."
It's a candy.  It really sticks to your teeth.  The taste of honey is not so apparent as the taste of the corn sugar shell.  The nutrients included are there in small amounts.  I can't see this boosting your health or energy unless you ate a whole pack and then you'd feel the sugar high.  It says Energy in it's name.  20 calories per piece.  5 grams of sugar carb does have energy in it.<br /><br />Not bad not great.
"Somehow the sensation of these little things made me think of stained glass, like in a cathedral, as I was enjoying one of them. Sweet but not cloying. Really excellent quality honey. One caveat would be to NOT enjoy one if you're going to sleep in a few hours. They do seem to deliver a lot of energy. I found it difficult to go to sleep when I had one after dinner. Absolutely delicious."
"The flavor of this product is smooth and enjoyable.  The honey comes through in just the right amount.  It is great as a piece of hard candy when you need a honey fix.  However, I did not notice any discernible increase in energy with this product.  I wasn't looking for a ""caffeine boost,"" but I did expect to feel something (since that is how the product is marketed).  So this is where you will have to weigh exactly what you are looking for.  If you want a great, honey candy, then you have the right item.  If you are looking for an energy boost, you might want to go elsewhere."
"Know what you are getting here.  These Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Honey drops are candy disguised as something else: energy boost, source of vitamins B6, B12, and C, and honey.<br /><br />They'll taste honey-like, with a soft center, but the thing is mainly sugar and high fructose corn syrup.  Use this to fulfill your vitamin needs and you'll probably add a few pounds while putting a few dollars in the pocket of your dentist.<br /><br />If you've ever chewed honeycomb, then you'll have a sense for the consistency of these drops when you start masticating.<br /><br />Oh, that continual search for a magic wellness bullet!"
"Ambrosoli Honees are candy, folks. The vitamin content in the drops looks almost like it was an accident. No protien? Even real honey has a gram or two of protien unless it's been so denatured that it's nutritionally valueless.<br /><br />It takes three drops to get 100% of the USDA recommended value of vitamin C, less than you'd get from eating one fresh orange. Along with the arificial vitamin C you'll get 60 calories (half of a can of sugary soda), 15gm carbs, 15 gm sugar, and still only nominal amounts of two or three other vitamins.<br /><br />These drops do more harm than good in my opinion. They're too sugary and deviod of any real nutritional value for me to take seriously."
"I grew up enjoying the original Ambrosoli Honees and was looking forward to trying this ""Energy Plus Vitamin"" version: I received one 1.58 oz. bar, and all of the drops were leaking their liquid centers, so it was a sticky affair. I don't recall ever experiencing this in my earlier consumption of the original ""Honees"", so maybe these are more fragile...hard to say with such a small sample size.<br />In any event, I did manage to get the wrapper off of a few of the drops and tried them: they have the familiar sugar/honey flavor that I remember fondly...and some of the liquid remained to be enjoyed.<br />The leakage aside (I'll assume that was due to bad handling), I feel the ""plus"" aspect is not worth the extra cost, and would recommend that customers consider opting for the original <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYKM"">Honees</a> or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E7SYKW"">Milk & Honey</a>, which are much more affordable...almost 50% less on Amazon...and obtain one's vitamin RDA via supplements or food."
"I love the taste of honey and at times I need an energy boost so I was eager to try these honey filled drops. The flavor is very good but I'm not sure if they deliver the energy part. The package says 3 drops equal 100% DV of vitamins B6, B13 and C. As I said I love honey but 3 lozenges is a lot to get down. Doesn't seem very convenient to me. Maybe if I ate one after the other through an afternoon but I dont see having 3 in a row. I'll update this when I try a few more."
"All in all, this isn't a bad product.  Each pack comes with 9 pieces, so in order to get the 100% of B6, B12 and Vitamin C you need to eat 3.  Which means you would run out in 3 days if you do 3 a day.  Another note is that each piece has 20 calories and 5 grams of sugar, so it will cost you 60 calories to get 100% of the aforementioned vitamins.<br /><br />I tried one before a 40 minute workout and didn't really notice much. I also tried one after a workout and it didn't give me much of a boost.  So, from that front, I can't say it really gave me an energy boost.<br /><br />I will say however, the product tastes wonderful!  The best part is when you get close to the honey center and bite into the candy, the honey slowly oozes into your mouth and on your tongue for a taste sensation that is very, very pleasant."
"These are nothing but sugar pills, although with three kinds of sugar, and with some vitamins:<br /><br />Calories: 20<br />Total Carb: 5g<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Vitamin A: 1%<br />Vitamin C 33%<br />Vitamin B6: 33%<br />Vitamin B12: 33%<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, corn Syrup, Honey, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C.<br /><br />They don't taste like honey to me, so I can imagine having these around for emergencies, but not for daily use."
"The product is a ""granola bar"" looking silver foil packet containing nine individually wrapped candy lozenges.  Each lozenge contains 20 calories of ""sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, and butter"" (actually labelled that way, in that order, on the wrapper).  The product is actually manufactured in Italy by the G. B. Ambrosoli Ronago company, and imported by Andre Prost, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  The label goes on to say that ""Honees"" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc.<br /><br />At a time when people all across America are spending $ billions on little tiny bottles of caffeine marked ""one hour energy,"" it appears that the Prost company is trying to cash in on the ""energy"" fad with a more honest approach that simply provides a blast of sugar. They have added vitamins B6, B12, and C to the product, so that three lozenges contains 100% of the daily requirement of these vitamins.<br /><br />Its very pleasant tasting.  Its got a nice mild ""honey-ish"" flavor, and the liquid honey center is a very nice reward at the end.  And I'm a person who enjoys the taste of honey and its benefits for a sore throat who is also aware of its high caloric density.  I was surprised that its only listed as the fourth most common ingredient; perhaps because honey is so much more expensive than sugar.<br /><br />For someone who normally enjoys hard candy (I'm not - my dentist advises against it.), ""Honees Energy Plus"" might be a nice addition to the product choices.  When I ordered the product, I was expecting a granola bar type experience, not a hard candy.  I suppose they are hoping people will overlook the calories to focus on the vitamins and energy.  Its a worthy idea.  Yet the candy, energy, and throat lozenge categories are all busting with product entries and are very competitive."
"Honey is an excellent energy source, which I like to use when working out for extra boosts. But it's really inconvenient to lug bottles of honey while on a walk or hike, and anyone who has ever tried, knows the upset of a leaked bottle in your backpack!! These make no mess and are so convenient - just put a few of these cello-wrapped treats in your pocket! Hard candy on the outside and then you get to the soft, chewy honey center. And at only 20 calories per piece, you're working off those cals in no time. I'll definitely buy more of these."
"If this is available in your area, buy it locally. you will save money and probably get fresher soda. If however, like me, you can't find this in your area, you must try it at least once. Not only is it some of the best soda i have tasted, but one of the best drinks. It has 200 calories per can, so of course it isn't for every day consumption, but a great treat every once in a while. The flavor is slightly similar to pineapple orange soda available at most grocery chains, but minus the orange. It is quite sweet and in no way bland. Highly recommended."
"****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.<br /><br />Overall, recommended.<br />****"
"Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves and star anise. These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought.<br /><br />The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate chai experience. Delicious when you add a packet of stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey. Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious.<br /><br />While drinking this tea you are transported to India where chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea. Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially enhanced by listening to Shiva Rea's Yoga Rhythms CD.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
Love these Jaw Breakers.  Had these all the time when I was young and when I noticed them on Amazon... I just had to have them.  They are just as good as I remember and last a long time.  Highly recommend.
"My husband loves these, we had a hard time finding them, they are wonderful and yummy.  We received them a few days after we ordered them and were very delighted with this product. They were also a great value."
"I've been getting these rawhide shoes for a while now and have been consistently pleased with the quality of the product. Even with shipping, which is discounted when you order multiple bags, the price is the same as I have found in stores. I slip some Every Flavor treats in the shoes and my dog enjoys them immensely."
"Iced Black Tea - Lemon - Ingredient list in order;  honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid, black tea powder, green tea powder, MALTODEXTRIN (corn), caramel color (contains sulfites), SUCRALOSE (sweetener), natural flavor, hibiscus extract.<br /><br />MALTODEXTRIN often contains MSG.<br /><br />Taste is good, 1 packet makes 16 oz. 10 cal.  Mixes easily.  They should clearly state the ingredients and not imply that it is sweetened with just Honey.  I am also concerned about possible MSG which causes me to not sleep well and is generally a much worse food additive than most people realize.<br /><br />These seem ok for when you run out of REAL brewed tea and want a quick substitute.  Or to take to restaurants to add to free water to save 2.50 + tax and tip on your total bill :)"
"This item contains sucralose.<br /><br />When I ordered the item, I read the description page twice and did not find any hint of fake sugar stuff, so I ordered the Mango Pineapple pack.  Shortly thereafter, I read the comments and tried to cancel (I hate Splenda for many reasons), but they were already being shipped.  I could have refused the package, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if I did not like it, my sister (addicted to Splenda) might.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I opened a stick and added a small amount to a cup of water.  Much to my surprise, it was not bad!.  The experience may have been different if I had used it as indicated, but I normally use this sort of dry mix sparingly.  In this case, it produced a fruity and sweet cup of water.  Not overly sweet - but again, I only used a small amount.  I decided to keep these and use with water or home made lemonade (instead of sugar or honey).  I will still share with my sister, but not all of them.<br /><br />Why 3 stars?<br />Average between misleading description (1 star) + good flavor (5)<br /><br />Amazon, please revise the description page!"
"I got this on a Gold Box deal and used the coupon so it came at a buck a box.I read hough the reviews and knew what I was getting.I got the Strawberry Acai and I can say that I can taste the honey ,strawberry and acai.There is a hint of green tea and yes too much splenda.I don't mind splenda but the problem with this product is that like any mass produced item it is made for the masses.The average america is like a hummingbird that is flapping it wings all day looking for the next hit of sugar.Starbucks ,McDonald's,Cimminbon the list goes on and on.The good thing about this product is that I can use it when you go to a place to eat and they don't have any good options for drinks.Just get water and add this do it.I can also take this to Panera Bread and get the free water and add this for a change of pace.Movie theaters with water fountains are another use ,bring an empty water bottle fill it up and add this.At least I know how many calories I am getting and it is better than the favored waters and diet sodas.It is very hard to eat right in this county ,I think this product is an eat better but not right."
"I ordered this instant tea to supplement the blueberry pomegranate pyramid tea bags I receive regularly. It's a quick, great Summer beverage--easy to prepare and simple to carry the slim pouches in my purse or lunch bag. My only complaint is that when made according to the package directions it is sickeningly sweet. I dilute it with more water or mix it with unsweetened instant tea."
"This product is of as high a quality as Nestea: No artificial colors and no acesulfame Potassium (Arizona teas still have this) only sucralose which CSPI ranks as ""probably safe""-- it is probably the safest artificial sweetener.  This product also contains a small amount of powdered honey (a little over 2 grams to get to the 10 calorie stick).  It is not marked as to where it is made(would be 5 star if marked-- I am picky).<br /><br />Mango Pinapple is one of the varieties that contains caffeine, Strawberry Acai is decaffeinated."
"The flavor is not bad and much less artificial tasting than crystal light, etc.  There is a taste of honey and the blackberry pomegranate flavor was good.  I over dilute mine (using 1 pouch to a 24 oz bottle) and it is still a little too sweet for me.  Hubby likes it the way it is supposed to be and of course, the kids will drink it any way you give it to them.  It is a better alternative on the go than buying soda or sugary beverages.  A nice alternative when we are tired of drinking plain water, etc.  Honestly, there are not a lot of ""healthier"" to go options that you can leave in the car or a bag.  Hopefully, there will be soon."
"I like this product pretty well - I have tried a couple of flavors now.  It is strong, so one packet does two glasses, but it is very expensive.  Part of me wonders how much different it is vs. a tin of iced tea powder mix.  All in all, its ok, but I would save the money and buy in bulk unless you absolutely need the packets."
"I was unsure how ""Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix"" would taste, I was interested but also a little leery. I decided to wait until I was in need of `refreshment' and not just a `drink.' Over the weekend I was working in the garden, came in and decided this was the time it was designed for.<br /><br />I poured a glass of water, added the powder and stirred. And stirred, and stirred again. The powder clumped a bit and took some work to break up. I took a small sip and mainly tasted the artificial sweetener. Not so good. I took the plunge and took a big swallow. That was rather better. It tasted of tea and the hint of honey and fruit. Not bad, I down the rest of the glass in two goes and was pleasantly surprised. Not bad.<br /><br />Then trouble creeped in as the main flavor ended and the taste of the artificial sweetener filled my mouth in the aftertaste. I do not make a habit of drinks with artificial sweetener and this aftertaste was the reason why. BLEAH.Since my wife is no stranger to diet soda's I asked her to give it a try. She had the exact same problems I did with the powder clumping badly and an even strong reaction to the aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end when you're downing it this is a nice, refreshing drink, BUT if you are not in the habit of `diet' drinks the aftertaste will be an unpleasant and unwelcome surprise."
"With this tea mix, Lipton is trying too hard to make a simple taste memorable. Adding honey, mango and pineapple tastes to green tea is a mishmash, not a recipe. While the mix is drinkable, its complicated flavors detract rather than add to the result."
"This completely reminds me of Kool-Aid.  Pretty sweet, no particular green tea taste.  I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine.  The granules take forever to dissolve so it is best used in a water bottle you can shake rather than a glass you have to stir.  I notice they've added a pitcher sized pack to the single serve lines which I assume would be more cost effective."
"On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an ""aftertaste"".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being ""your cuppa tea""."
"Recently becoming tea connoisseurs, my husband and I are thrilled to try Lipton To Go Stix.  Small packets of Strawberry Acai flavored tea that is simple to use and provide a great tasting beverage.  Simply pour the stix into a bottle of water and shake well, or pour into a glass and stir well.  Drink and enjoy: pretty simple concept that is well known.<br /><br />At 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it is a reasonable substitute for other drinks.  Plus, it is decaffeinated, so that is a big plus.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely strawberry.  I am not sure what acai tastes like, but I could not taste any other flavor than strawberry.  So if you are looking for a strong tea flavor, this is not the flavor for you.  It tastes more like diluted juice than tea for sure.<br /><br />I really like this product and will gladly buy it again. A note, be sure to stir or shake well, as the box notes tea takes longer to dissolve."
"When I saw this I thought ""Oh boy! ice tea , sweetened with honey sugar and a taste of strawberries"". I should have been thinking ""Oh boy, tastes like raspberry jello and I can DRINK it"". Don't get me wrong, it tastes alright for what it is . Just don't get your mouth all puckered up for tea because there isn't much tea taste to it.  The person who came up with the idea of adding sucralose should be fired. Maybe that was their way of competing with all the no-calorie, low-calorie ""water enhancers"" on the market but I think they will lose more customers with the sucralose than they would with a few more calories. But what do I know?<br /><br />Anyway, a description of the product. The box comes with 10 little packets about the size of a stick of gum. Easy to carry in your pocket or purse. Each packet flavors 16 oz of water.  Each packet has a little slit making it easy to open and an opening just the right size to empty  it into a bottle.  Dissolves quickly. Decaf ,if that's important to you.<br /><br />The ""GO Stix"", in water,  were a little too strong for my taste but I emptied one into a 2 quart pitcher of Lipton iced tea and it gave it a very nice, subtle strawberry taste. I think that is the way I'll be using mine. Not what they were intended for ,I know , but works for me."
"I like the drink. It doesn't taste like tea, though. It has a fruity, red in color, taste with a slight after taste probably from the sucralose. I would prefer the drink without the artificial sweetener(s). The drink is already sweetened with honey and if still not sweet enough, I would prefer to add a little sugar if needed. But, the drink is good and low calorie, so a decent trade-off. Also, the mix dissolved easily in the water."
"Lipton has another winner on their hand with their new on the go honey, strawberry acai iced green tea packets.  You get all the health benefits of the green tea as well as 5 calories per serving.  I have found with most low calorie tea you lose a lot of flavor, but this one has all the sweetness you crave without the guilt.  More fruity tasting than tea tasting, but still worth it."
"This tea had a refreshing, fruity flavor that was really delicious. Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great."
"I got a package of these to review for the Amazon Vine program.  I'm not normally a big fan of these add to water drinks.  But, this one is really good. It's not as much green tea as it is mango and pineapple. If you're a tea lover, you might not like this so much. It's very fruity.  I like the fact that it's not all artificially sweetened even though it does contain an artificial sweetener.  At least there is some honey in it.  I would definitely buy these.  I couldn't keep them away from my daughters and my wife."
"Ok, so I tried the Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai flavor. While I liked the Strawberry Acai flavor in and of itself, I did NOT like the after taste left behind. It uses sucralose as a sweetener and I just don't like the ""coating of the tongue"" effect you get from that. I don't drink diet beverages normally, so I might just be more sensitive to the sucralose. I suppose if you are one who drinks diet beverages normally you would probably not notice the after taste that most diet beverages leave. I would love if they made this product with real sweeteners and not artificial."
"I don't like fake sugar flavor and I don't like things to be super sweet.  I'm tough to please in the beverage department.  But, these little iced tea things make the cut!  They dissolve easily, even at the office without a spoon to use to stir and the flavor is light and sweet, not cloying and artificial.  I do use a bit more water than the package recommends, but I find this product pleasing and excellent!"
"If you are a fan of the drink to go packets that you add to a water bottle, you will love these.  They come in a couple different flavors and are a nice to change up to the old routine.  The honey, strawberry acai is tasty.  Quite different than several of the other packets I've tried.  If you are looking for a way to drink more water without the caffeine, these are terrific.  Many of the tea varieties of other brands contain caffeince, but these are decaf.  They do contain some artificial sweetner which I would prefer to not have, but the flavor doesn't have a strong aftertaste and it does limit the calories.  I would definitely recommend giving these a try."
"For a water-flavoring powder, it doesn't mix too well with water. Unlike other brands where you can just pour water over the powder and it'll mix itself and dissolve, this stuff needs to be stirred and stirred and stirred, and you'll still end up with random clumps of unmixed powder anyway. The flavor is pretty good, but as others have said, there's no real honey taste. It tastes more like a sugar-free Crystal Light mix. Not that is a bad thing, but it's not the flavor it says it should be."

"To me, if a product is advertised as being an iced tea mix, there should at least be some tea in the list of ingredients, and the product should have some tea taste. Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai (how's that for a memorable name) does have ""decaffeinated green tea powder"" in the list of ingredients, third behind honey granules (sugar honey) and something called ""malic acid.""<br /><br />Perhaps that's why this product, which is low calorie (5 calories per every 8 ounce serving) and convenient (just add water to the ""to go"" packet, and shake), doesn't real have an iced tea taste. The taste is pleasant enough, and this product definitely tastes okay (it has a strawberry taste), but sorry, it's not iced tea.<br /><br />Te good news is that this product is non-fat, and very low calorie. And the packets are very convenient, which is great if you are looking for a low calorie, non-fat soda replacement at work or school. It's just not iced tea."
"I'm a big guy who's not afraid of calories, and while I like this tea, I was saddened to learn that it used artificial sweetener to keep the calorie intake low.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather not have ANY sweetener, or go with something that isn't artificial.<br /><br />Otherwise the tea tastes nice and is cooly portable."
"I really like the taste of this drink. It tastes like a smooth fruit juice. I was expecting it to taste like a flavored tea, but it's more of a flavored fruit juice. I do like the health quality of it. And being that it is caffeine free, it is great for my whole family, my 5 year old loves it as much as his kool-aid, so this makes a great alternative! I would recommend it if you're looking for a fruity tasting drink, just don't expect it to taste like tea.<br />Also, it dissolved quickly. Some ""tea"" mixes tend to sit at the top of my bottle, this did not."
"I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage."
"I liked this product a bit. It was a refreshing change of monotony from the Crystal Light that I've been drinking. It tasted just as good as Crystal Light and kept me refreshed. I would recommend this to anyone, ESPECIALLY those who are looking to give Crystal Light and the other drink mixes a break."
"At just 5 calories per serving, and with no caffeine, this is a refreshing and portable beverage. The label says each packet is 2 servings, so most people will use the entire thing and have 10 calories. The to-go packets make it easy to keep in your purse. The packets say it is sweetened with honey, but it also contains sucralose (the generic for Splenda), so I think the label is a little misleading. I liked the strawberry flavor and it didn't have a strong diet after-taste, although I could tell it had artificial sweetener. I like that it doesn't contain artificial colors. If you like other green tea beverages, I highly recommend this one. I'd definitely get it again!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Honey granules (sugar, honey)<br />Malic acid<br />Decaffeinated green tea powder<br />Hibiscus extract<br />Maltodextrin (corn)<br />Sucralose (sweetener)<br />Natural Flavor<br />Strawberry juice solids<br />Acai juice solids"
"The instant beverage market has exploded in recent years - what started with Kool-Aid is now half an aisle at the local grocery store. Products like Mio and these Lipton packets are brilliant to have ""on the road"". This newest flavor from Lipton is pretty creative, and shows that companies are slowly running out of the basics. The flavor of the tea, honey, mango pineapple is good - the ingredients list is pretty decent (no propolyne Glycol like in Mio for example). One packet is enough to flavor a regular bottle of water, and factoring in the price of both, this makes a pretty cheap flavored water.<br /><br />That said, there is also something to be said for sticking to normal unflavored water, but lets be honest - everyone needs some flavor every now and then."
"This tea tastes a bit like strawberry jam to me.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I tried dissolving it in both a glass of cold water and shaking it in a plastic water bottle. Both ways produces a good blend of the product with little or no powder left.  I already finished my box, so that is a testament to how refreshing it is. It's a good substitution for soda or if you want something treat-like in your water."
"Lipton Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai is an individually-packaged drink sweetener that you add to water in order to improve the flavor. It is decaffeinated, which I especially like, and is pretty simple to use: tear off the top, pour it into a bottle of water, and shake it up until the powder is completely dissolved. What you get is a refreshing, low calorie (10 calorie if you use the entire packet) drink that is an alternative to cola and plain water.<br /><br />Overall, the product has a decent flavor, and you can definitely taste the honey and strawberry. I do, however, have two problems with it. First, the box states the product is ""made with real ingredients,"" yet it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (which is marketed under the trade name Splenda). The use of sucralose in no way invalidates the other ""real"" ingredients like tea leaves and strawberries, but it also means that not every ingredient in the drink is *natural* (something people often infer when the term ""real"" is used). Second, each packet contains enough for TWO bottles of water - if you pour the whole packet into one bottle, it will probably be significantly too sweet.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. I liked the flavor overall, and will use it in the future. It is a valid alternative to diet cola, and has a more natural flavor than many other water sweeteners on the market."
"This product does taste good, and it only contains 5 calories from 1 gram of sugar. It takes 2 or 3 minutes to completely dissolve, but that's not a problem. What is confusing/questionable are some of the ingredients. Among others listed are ""sucralose (sweetner), Maltodextrin (corn), ... isomalt"". What are these things? Two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner. Is this Maltodextrin (corn) similar to high fructose corn syrup?<br /><br />Also, at the very bottom of the ""Nutrition Facts"", apart from the ingredients list, 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet"" is also mentioned. When only 1/2 packet (one serving per the package) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water, the taste is definitely watered down."
"A while back I tested a couple of flavors of Mio and found them to be one dimensional and disturbingly artificial. On one hand, while I usually brew my own ice tea for daily drinking, I don't always have it and sometimes would like a substitution. Mio isn't it. Lipton To Go Stix are an improvement over Mio. Mio tends to only hit parts of your tongue's taste buds and lacks a balance and fullness of flavor, in addition to tasting fake. Real brewed iced tea has a broad spectrum of flavors that cover a wide range of taste buds while highlighting the flavors you brew it for. In my case, I make cold brewed green tea with honey and I can actually taste the green tea and honey. With tea drink mixes, though, I rarely taste the tea. Most are overly sweet for me. The Lipton To Go Stix, however, when mixed as directly, is not overbearing in sweetness or any one flavor. I still don't taste ice tea, but the other flavors taste like they are supposed to and it covers a wider range of tastebuds. It does not taste artificial. The 7 ingredients include flavors from natural sources (honey, sugar, green tea powder, hibiscus) versus Mio's mostly synthesized formulas.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I may pick up some of these To Go Stix if I see them on sale. I think Lipton did a good job of creating natural flavors and it may fit the bill as a substitute drink for me."
"I love flavored tea, blackberry and pomegranate but I don't love this tea mix. I'm thinking it must be the green tea which is not the same flavor as black tea. I'm not saying I don't like Lipton Tea & Honey, just that I don't love it."
"I don't like most powdered teas, either because of their articial flavor, the bad aftertaste, their use of certain artificial sweeteners, or some combination of the above. However I did enjoy the Lipton Honey Mango Pineapple Ice Tea, albeit with a few caveats.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor, and didn't find it too ""chemically"" or with a significant aftertaste. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so (depending on how you mix it). However, I found that following the mixing instructions of the box made the tea far too strong and sweet. I'd recomend starting with half the listed amount, and adding from there to taste.<br /><br />Although some people have stated that this is ""all natural"", do be aware that it contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the tea, but I would like it much more if it were a bit less sweet, and really were all natural."
"My kids and I enjoy the flavor of the Blackberry Pomegranate Iced Green Tea Mix from Lipton, but it doesn't taste like I'm drinking tea.  The fruit flavor doesn't really taste like a juice, either. It's very good, but I do wish it tasted more like an herbal-green tea mix with less sweetness.  My kids disagree. They like the flavor and its sweetness just the way it is.  I prefer to drink it diluted to half-strength, so instead of pouring the whole pouch into my 16 oz. water bottle or glass, I pour in half of it.  Or I get my 32 oz. water jug and pour the whole pouch into that.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it doesn't taste like tea at all, the other small complaint I have is that the powder doesn't fully dissolve.  There are always a few small dark pink balls floating around, no matter how much I stir or shake it.  I just tell myself it's little pieces of fruit and go ahead and drink it.  I have noticed that they do dissolve by the time I finish the drink, if I manage not to swallow them down.<br /><br />This is a great flavor additive if you are trying to drink more water, but just can't bring yourself to drink it plain.  It should be noted that it does contain caffeine and artificial sweeteners."
"I can't say that this product tasted bad, but it did not deliver what was promised. The mixture didn't taste of tea or pommegranate. It tasted mildly of berry, more like a water enhancer than anything else. The color of the drink was inviting, and it smelled pleasant. No artificial (chemical) sweetner taste."
"Well now, this was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Lately I've become disenfranchized by the sameness of many of the boxed,powdered drink mixes. Nothing seems to really jump out and make me reach for it eagerly; and a lot of them end up reminiscent of Tang in different flavors.<br /><br />Lipton's new Tea and Honey Mango Pineapple is a break from the norm. There is a lot of flavor here, and a lot of satisfaction in its qualities. The honey and fruit combines to deliver a refreshing, good-tasting drink that makes me want another right away.<br /><br />One slight caveat: as with all drinks including artificial sweeteners (sucralose; 5 calories per packet) there is a mild aftertaste. Overall, however, comparing drinks of this sort, this was quite acceptable."
"I normally don't like diet drinks. I'm one of those that hate the aftertaste that artificial sweeteners have. I tried one of the Green Teas sweetened with Honey by Lipton & was pleasantly surprised. So I decided to give this flavor a try as well. It's not as good as the Green Tea. Obviously, the tea is very artificial tasting, not like their bottled tea. It's powdered instant tea though so I it's to be expected. However, after a few sips, it grew on me. The fruitiness is there but not over powering. The packaging is very convenient. I can just throw one in my purse and pour it into a 16 oz. bottle of water wherever I am. The great part for me is that this is less sugar I am drinking so anything that can win me over in that dept is a keeper."
"First off, I love all of Lipton's products. But especially love these little stix they have come out with. All I do is pour the contents of one stix into a bottle of water and shake. It's so easy to make and there is no mess. Forget about the days where you'd have to make a big pitcher of ice tea and put it into your fridge taking up all of this space. Now you can make individual cups/glasses/bottles.<br /><br />The taste is great as well. You can't even tell that it's decaffeinated either. I take these to work with me and find them very convenient to use.<br /><br />This flavor especially is really really good."
"I'm not sure I'd go to the store specifically to buy this drink, but that said, it's the sort of fruity drink perfect for a tall glass, lots of ice, and a good book. There is a slight ""diet"" taste to it, but that could be because I'm not watering it down enough and therefore it's a bit ""strong.""<br /><br />It's a great drink to accompany a long catch-up conversation with a friend or sit by yourself next to a pool. Either way though, I keep picturing it as a summer drink. I can't imagine it being quite so refreshing if you're wrapped up in a quilt huddling by a fire.<br /><br />The little to-go pack took me a while to figure out how to open. That cut they put in it almost looked like a mistake rather than the way you're actually supposed to open the thing.<br /><br />Watering it down might spread out the taste a bit. I'm more of a raspberry/blueberry sort of girl, but this is a pleasant diversion. If you like green tea you should give this a shot."
"When I  mixed this up, I put 4 packages together to make just under a gallon. I have to tell you, that I finished the pitcher in one day. The tea was tasty and refreshing.  I really tasted the green tea and the mango; the pineapple and the honey, not so much. the label states that the powder would take a little time to dissolve, but I didn't find that to be the case.  My only complaint is that te individual packets call for 16.9 bottles of water. I don't always have that size. I would like to see this in a 1 or 2 quart envolope, or a canister. Let me determine how much I wish to make. Would buy again. No artificial chemical sweetner taste."
"I like this. I don't really taste any ""tea"" flavor, but I definitely taste pomegranate, blackberry, and even honey! It even has a nice pomegranate smell when you pour it in.<br /><br />One stick makes 8 fl oz, but I actually used one stick for a regular glass, which is about 16 fl oz and found it to be strong enough for my tastes. There were some little chunks that didn't mix up all the way - I made this in a glass with ice and cold water. I expect you wouldn't have that problem if you were using a water bottle and shaking it up.<br /><br />I'd buy this again, or order it again if I got it as a drink in a restaurant."
"This sounded intriguing, so I selected it from Amazon Vine.  I guess this is a convenient and decent tasting product (though a whole packet in one cup seemed a little too much).<br /><br />You can pick up a huge container of instant SF iced tea for $3 that will way outlast the 10 packets here that probably cost about the same for a fraction of the uses.<br /><br />All in all, ok, if convenience is critical."
I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program<br /><br />This Lipton to go decard tea is good and is refreshing.<br /><br />I wished it had less ingredients but overall is a better<br />alternative to soda pop. And less calories.
"My first sip impression was that of mango with an odd but not unpleasant underlying aromatic flavor.  After trying some other products, I realized this is probably the green tea.  Once I got used to it, I found I quite liked it.  This drink is very refreshing and does not fill me up like a carbonated drink would.  I especially value that it is so low cal as compared to my normal iced tea mixes.  The single serve is very convenient but I wish it also came in a bulk pack for the mass consumption I intend to do if our Pacific Northwest weather ever gets warm!"

'nuf said! :) Does this sound like your kind of refreshment?  Off to buy More, before it is all gone!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012"
I am constantly looking for new flavors for my water.  I like the taste of strawberries but I am not really a fan of green tea.  This flavor stix doesn't have a bad aftertaste and it is bursting with strawberry flavor.  My husband took a drink from my bottle and he said he would like a bottle all his own because he really likes the taste also. I will be looking for this flavor again when my box is all gone.
This was a little too sweet. The mango and pineapple kind of overtake the tea. But if you like really sweet tea then you will love this. Obviously it is very convenient. You just pour the packet into a bottle of water and shake. I would even venture to say you could use half a pack and it be just as good. This may need a little diluting. But still recommend.
"The predominant flavor of this drink mix is mango with a hint of pineapple.  I really do like it.  It's also very convenient.  Each packet/stick is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  Really good.  I do recommend."
Pretty impressive for Lipton for their fruit infusion which is amazing! I found this to work better when you insert these packages in the 16.9 ounce bottles and THEN refrigerate them as they dissolve easier this way. In addition; I had even used the remainder in my small CamelBak® while I went on a 60 mile cycling tour on March 31st on my Trek® (Racing / Touring Cycle) to keep hydrated. I adore Mangoes and Pineapples; but come across mixing this with tea - that I have never heard of(I own a Mango tree and grow Pineapples)!<br /><br />It's great for anyone who is a FRUIT FUSION lover or a smoothie lover or those who dare to venture into something different!
"This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The ""open here"" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice."
"Overall, I have been enjoying this drink. It's fruity and pleasant, with a honey taste that comes through pretty strongly. I like that it's decaf, so I can drink it any time of day. I like that it contains sucralose instead of aspartame.<br /><br />I have been using one packet in a large, 16-ounce glass, since each packet is technically two 8-ounce servings. The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea? Not at all.<br /><br />I like that it's low-calorie (though not technically sugar-free, since, as the ingredient list states, the honey granules contain sugar). But I've been avoiding sugar lately, so I'll take it!"
"I love iced tea, and usually enjoy it home-made and unsweetened. Unfortunately, there are some activities that keep me from dragging along a large jar of home-made tea, so I have to settle for the fake stuff.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light versions, and have universally hated the aftertaste, although I like plenty of their other flavors. I had also tried a Lipton version of their ice tea and lemonade a few years back, and wasn't that impressed. This one looked intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I always mix these with 26 oz rather than the 16 oz they usually call for, and at this strength the tea flavor is rather diluted, however the sweetness and mango/pineapple tang are near perfect. Very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix takes quite awhile to dissolve in water, and it will settle to the bottom if you don't cap the bottle and shake aggressively for half a minute or so before drinking."
An instant iced tea mix with good taste. Dissolves quickly. For my personal taste its a little sweet but MOST people who drink sweet tea drink tea as sweet or sweeter than this. Its a great quick substitute for brewed iced tea when none is available or for on-the-go use.
"I really liked the taste of this. I mixed it with 16.9 water bottles, cold from the refrigerator. I found it took quite a bit of shaking to mix the powder in, and never did get it completely dissolved as there were still tiny bits that settled to the bottom. I think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix, it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle.<br />The strawberry taste was excellent, not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go. The package has a notch to make opening easier. I will definitely buy these. I would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve."
i use 1 stick per 32 oz bottle of water.  i don't care for sweet drinks.  so per 32oz of water really delutes it.  it has a strong pineapple taste with a mango filler.  it would be good with alcohol as a mixer for that tropical taste.  for me it was ok and the wife liked it.  so if you like pineapple and mango drinks.  this would be a good one to get.
"This is the second flavor of Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix that I have tried. This mango/pineapple is delicious! It mixes easily and leaves no residue.<br /><br />My two gripes: Why on earth package a drink mix designed for water bottles as "" mix 1/2 package with an 8 oz bottle""? Who buys those? The most common size of water bottles in my section of mid-america is 16 oz. Just stupidity.<br /><br />And, the misleading title of ""tea with honey"". If you check the ingredients, there is way more than honey sweetening this beverage. How about sucralose  and maltodextrin?<br /><br />So, basically, it's just another sugared beverage. But it is pretty tasty!"
Have to give it 3 stars as I thought it wasn't bad but my husband hated the after taste. It does have a little bit of an after taste but I didn't think it was too bad. My husband disagreed. So if you want something different than plain water or soda give this a try.
"I love the To Go sticks that you simply mix in a bottle of water!  I've had many different brands and flavors over the years.  The Lipton To Go Iced Green Tea and Honey with Blackberry Pomegranate wasn't too bad.  Both of my kids (ages 6 and 7) wanted to try it too.  The 6 year old gave it a thumbs down but the 7 year old gave a thumbs up.<br /><br />The powder did not dissolve too well.  I shook and shook and shook but there was still some parts that were not dissolving (both in chilled and unchilled water.)  I also don't like that the instructions are to mix in an 16.9 oz container of water, but the serving suggestion and caloric information is all based on 8 oz (Why can't we keep things simple?)  Still at 10 calories for a 16.9 oz bottle of water, that isn't bad.  No fat, only 1 gm - per serving - of sugars.  The big plus for me is the 10mg of caffeine that it has per serving!  I can skip my afternoon coffee but still get that extra little lift to get me through.<br /><br />It also says that it is naturally sweetened with honey.  Which, yea, it has honey granuels in it, but it also has sucralose.<br /><br />Overall it is pretty good as a water enhancement powder.  I would buy in the future."
"This is quite a good product; the beverage comes in easy to mix and use individual packets, and boasts a low 10 calories per serving. But the low calorie count doesn't sacrifice flavor; the brew is smooth and refreshing, if not quite crisp, and will make a fine drink for hot summer days. The drink mixes up to an attractively clear and deep purple color.<br /><br />The predominant flavor is blackberry, which seems to overpower the others. Honey could be distinguished only as a sweetener, not for characteristic honey taste. Pomegranate could not be easily detected. And, surprisingly, there was little green tea flavor, a result which I wouldn't have expected in a Lipton product, most of which seem to have carefully engineered tastes.<br /><br />There is one unusual use for this drink that I'll bet the designers didn't anticipate: It makes a very good mixer for neutral-flavored alcohol add-ins (adults only, please!).<br /><br />I give this four stars for convenience, good flavor, low calories, and versatility. One star comes off for the lack of tea flavor in what is sold as a tea drink."
"These To-Go drink mixes are great. They are so convenient to buy, store, and use. They are economical too. This specific flavor though is not my favorite. I like the Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate flavor much better.<br /><br />In terms of sweetness, though, it is just right. They tell you to use 16.9 ounces of water, but I always add more water (about 22 oz) to these To-Go type powdered drink packets, and I find that much better.<br /><br />There are 5 calories per packet. It has a mix of sugar, honey, and sucralose (same thing as splenda) which keeps the calorie count down.<br /><br />While I wouldn't buy this in the future, if you like strawberry, then you might like this flavor."
"Lipton's Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea, the Blackberry Pomegranate flavor this time around, has a perky berry taste I like, unfortunately with the slight after taste of a diet drink (possibly the sucralose sweetener). The ease of putting it in a 16.9 fl oz. water bottle is a plus, and after several shakes, the packet dissolves nicely.  I appreciate being able to make some bottles ahead of time."
"This is a great tasting, low calorie iced green tea mix  from Lipton.  It is not too bitter, although the use of sucralose, which is extremely sweet, makes it a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  My wife loves the stuff - then again she does not mind artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Speaking of sucralose, I was surprised because it appeared that Lipton had actually come up with something that was not bad for you.  However, closer examination of the ingredients revealed use of an artificial sweetener (sucralose), which is one way to make the iced tea sweet and low calorie.  Although this is probably the least offensive of the artificial sweeteners, I generally avoid them like the plague.  Besides, the only reason why I was excited about this tea mix was because it appeared natural - tea, honey, strawberries - how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Each package contains approximately 4 grams of the iced tea mixture - because it is so sweet, you could probably get away with using less than the recommended serving size (1/2 package or 2 g) and it would still taste pretty good.  I might go with 1/4 package. Whatever you do, don't dump the whole package in a glass.  As far as the flavors go, strawberry overwhelms everything else - this tastes like the fruit drinks my children love.<br /><br />For those of you that don't care about ingesting artificial sweeteners you will probably enjoy this iced tea mix - it does taste pretty good.  I generally liked the stuff, although I will dilute the mixture next time around."
"Looking for a way to spice up your drinking water and getting tired of adding lemons or limes?  Lipton's Tea & Honey mix adds a flavorful new option already divided into individual serving packets, which makes it easy to add to a water bottle on the go or a full glass of water at home.<br /><br />This particular flavor is quite different from the standard powdered mixed drinks, having a strong honey taste with a light strawberry twist.  There isn't much sugar in it either, at only 2 grams per packet, so it's an option to consider for diabetics or people watching their sugar intake.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers have noted there is a small amount of sucralose (Splenda) in here, which is something to consider if you don't care for artificial sweeteners. As the husband of someone with Type 1 diabetes I've gotten quite used to it and find it to be a very enjoyable flavor, so it didn't personally bother me at all.<br /><br />If you don't have time to brew up iced tea at home and want a quick flavor boost for water, this is a great option, and is an excellent way to make bottled water more exciting on picnics or car trips."
"I drink a lot of flavored waters using the ready-to-mix packets, primarily the Crystal Light brand - I can't recall drinking a Lipton brand but, after drinking this one, I will add it to the list.<br /><br />This packet has a good flavor, although the blackberry (to me) had a hint of grape in it.  I mixed it in a 20 ounce bottle of cold water - the directions say use a 16.9 ounce bottle - and it still tasted just a bit too sweet to be called perfect.  The powdered mix is not as fine as Crystal Lite but a little thicker and coarse, so you will spend a little bit more time shaking the bottle in order to mix it properly.<br /><br />There are 10 calories per packet, even though the front of the box says 5 calories in big letters because each packet is two servings.  That's about the same as Crystal Light.  Overall, this one is pretty good and I think I will try out a few of their other flavors to add some variety."
"Normally, I hate any zero calorie drink. Artificial sweeteners have a bad aftertaste to me. So I didn't have high hopes for this. Well, I was surprised. This tea is partially sweetened with natural honey so I guess this helps to eliminate some of the aftertaste. This particular flavor is very fruity & refreshing. I poured the packet into a 16 oz. bottle of water and it was great. The packets come in convenient travel size packets that would be easy to stash in a purse or pocket. This is a really nice alternative for someone that wants something fruity & not loaded with sugar & calories. Can't wait to try the other flavors!"
"This to-go iced tea was very easy to prepare.  The powder mix instantly dissolved in cold water.<br /><br />The strawberry flavor is refreshing but reminded me of Crystal Lite or Koolaid.  My son found it too sweet; however, it was just right for me.<br /><br />It seemed more like a fruity drink rather than a tea beverage."
"I am a fan of flavored ice teas, and this one tastes great. I don't taste and honey flavor, but the strawberry is definitely evident. It is more berry like than strawberry flavor. My only complaint is that the flavor is too strong. I could get two bottle/cups out of one packet. 1/2 pouch is plenty of flavor for my tastes.I will definitely purchase this in the future."
I did enjoy this just add water & mix fruit tea. Because of the tea granules it does take some mixing which is not a problem. I was surprised that the drink could have a strawberry flavor that was sweet but not too fake tasting also I was wondering about the strange aftertaste that was reminiscent of a diet drink.<br /><br />The drink touts itself on being sweetened with HONEY and other natural juices yet maintains its paltry 5 calories without the aid of aspartame - so it is healthy right? Well that super sweetness is in thanks to SUCRALOSE an artificial sweetener that just happens to be 600 times as sweet as table sugar and 3 times sweeter than aspartame.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />So the drink is an official diet drink if NOT 100% natural.
"This is a powder drink mix that you can add to your water bottle. (Each packet is meant to be added to 16.9 fl oz of water.) I think it tastes okay, but it is more like juice than tea. I don't really taste the green tea part. It reminds me of the Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. I tried the drink both cold and hot, and it tastes fine either way. The powder doesn't dissolve as readily in cold water but stirring helped. The only thing I don't like is that even though it claims to be only 5 calories without using aspartame, I noticed that there is sucralose in the ingredients list. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener used in sweeteners such as Splenda, and I've never liked the taste of it."
"It seems to me that this ""TEA"" product mirrors some of my crystal light products. I think Lipton is trying to get a bigger step in this flavored water market.  For me, seeing a name like Lipton on the box would push me into buying this product until I taste it and then I think of crystal light. Although tea is the third item on the ingredient list, for the life I me I can't taste ANY tea.  The first two are honey granules (sugar) and citric acid for tartness.  The third is green tea powder.<br /><br />Another thing that is really odd is that the packet, of which there are ten in the box...half of the packet is a serving. But, when I think about this, isn't that what crystal light is also?<br /><br />Getting down to what I thought of this product...Doesn't have enough tea in it for me to drink it as caffeine. Even when I put the whole packet in 20 ounces of water, it was still too, too, sweet and strong."
"One thing is certain, they don't skimp on the blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this drink!  If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim."
"This doesn't taste like green tea to me, but it tastes a lot like strawberry kool aid.  That's OK because I LIKE strawberry kool aid, and I'm not a big fan of sweet tea.<br /><br />Most of this is sugar or sweetener of some kind - ""honey granules"" (sugar, honey - they added sugar to honey?  Really?), maltodextrin (corn sugar), and sucralose (Splenda).  There's green tea powder, hibiscus extract, strawberry juice solids, and acai juice solids are the flavor.  The flavors work well together, but again, it's pretty sweet.  I tried it full strength with 12 ounces of water, and it was too much.  I poured half a packet into a 20 oz bottle of water, and it was almost the right strength.  The cool thing about that is that a box of this will last a little longer for me."
"I should premise this by saying I am not a huge fan of overly sweet drinks. This product comes in a box of 10 small pouches full of drink mix. The directions say to pour the mix in a 16.9 oz bottle of water and shake vigorously or pour into a glass of water and stir. It warns that the tea takes some time to dissolve, and it did- about a minute of stirring before it was fully dissolved. It was easy to mix with a bottle you can shake, but it does eventually dissolve. The tea itself is fairly sweet, but still nice and tart enough for me. I preferred to water it down even more than the box suggested and put one pouch into a 20oz. bottle which made it more palatable for me. However, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweet side, I would follow the directions as stated.  There is about 20 mg of caffeine per pouch as well and 10 calories per packet. Overall, pretty tasty little drink mix! Definitely a convenient way to zing up your water on the go!"
"My family and I are all tea lovers - both hot and cold.  The Lipton to-Go is of course an iced green tea.  A perfect blend of honey, tea leaves and real fruit solids make it a healthy alternative to sodas.  Each packet makes two 8 oz servings, which have 5 calories, 10 mg of caffeine, and 2 g of sugar.  Although I usually drink a whole 16 oz, I still don't think it's too bad.  My daughter mixed a packet by agitating it in a 16.9 fl oz water bottle, and experienced no problems dissolving it.  However, I mixed a packet in a 16 oz glass of water and had to work a little harder to dissolve it.  That's my only complaint."
"I like both blackberry tea and pomegranate juice, so I thought this would be an easy ""A+"". Not the case.<br />First of all, drink mix packets are everywhere these days. Most of them are designed for a 16 oz bottle and plainly say so. For some reason, Lipton has decided to print directions that say to add 1/2 packet to 8 oz of water. Why? How many people actually buy 8 oz bottles? And, if they felt their product was aimed at those who would seek out 8 oz bottles, why not make the packet with just enough for that? Just odd.<br /><br />'Tea and Honey"" is proudly proclaimed several places on the package. Classic combination. Clearly stating ' NO asperatame!"". ""Sweetened with honey, Real tea leaves, real fruit flavors"". But there was a funny, artificial taste. Reading the ingredient list reveals: sucralose and maltodextrin. YUCK!<br /><br />Besides the artificial taste, or maybe because of it, instead of tea, this really tastes like Kool-Aid. If you're ok with that, then this is an ok drink. Me? I'll pass."
"I know I'm not the only one out there who doesn't like to drink water. I'm always looking for solutions to help me put down more of the stuff each day - solutions that are low calorie, caffeine free, and pleasant tasting. Most of the mini packs of powder feel to me like I'm adding chemicals to my water glass, which seems to counter the healthy idea I'm going for in drinking water. These packs are pleasant tasting, although they don't really taste at all like tea - think of them more as a Crystal Light type equivalent. I also couldn't really taste the honey - I would have described them more as a generic ""berry"" flavor, but not cloyingly sweet."
I've been drinking this at work and it is a good alternative to soda. I tend to like my drinks on the weak side so I water this down a little more than the directions say because it is pretty strong. I can't imagine drinking this in the middle of winter but it is perfect to throw in a gym bag in case you want to put some flavor in your water while working out.<br />I wasn't even aware that the product is low calorie (5 per serving) I was just wanting something different so the low calories a big bonus.
"This product has great taste, and not too sweet. The tea mixes up in your water like coolaide, and comes in individual packets so you can take it along with you. However, the packets do not tear by hand, but you must use a knife or scissors to get them open. That is the only thing that needs to be improved."
Got my package today so I opened it up then put one packet in a bottle of drinking water then put that in the fridge so it would get cold as thats the way I like to drink tea. Did the same to another packet & water bottle. A few hours later I decided to taste one of the cold bottles. A nice strength when added to a 16.9 oz bottle without being overpowering. I did shake the bottle before opening it of course. Good & tasty. Not too strong on the sugar & a nice mix of flavors. Be aware this will turn the water red in color which is not a problem. I might buy some of this when my box of 10 packets runs out. I'd say try this. You just might like it as I do!!
"I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THE LIPTON ICED GREEN TEA MANDARIN AND MANGO UNDER SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE FOR A LONG TIME.  AMAZON INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.  I READ SOMEWHERE (MAYBE IN SOME REVIEWS) THAT LIPTON DISCONTINUED.  DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.  AT ANY RATE, I DECIDED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT AND AM NOT VERY HAPPY.  FIRST OF ALL, UNLIKE THE MANDARIN AND MANGO PRODUCT, THIS ONE HAS SUGAR IN IT.  SECONDLY, IT JUST DOESN'T TASTE ANYTHING LIKE MANGO PINEAPPLE AND IS QUITE FRANKLY NOT VERY GOOD."
"Check the ingredients. Should say ""PARTIALLY"" sweetened with honey. Also includes several other kinds of sugars. I had a free sample but I won't purchase this item myself."
"Lipton Go Stix are a new, convenient, portable way to make small amounts of iced tea. Flavor, of course, is a subjective matter, but I think the Honey and Strawberry Acai version is delicious. A box of these is a handy thing to have in an office desk drawer, or any location where you'd like to make only a glass or two. Green tea and acai are currently considered excellent for promoting good health. This product is fairly expensive if you want to make tea by the quart or half gallon, however."
"We love this delicious tea.  The addition of the mango and pineapple flavors adds to the terrific taste.  And just 5 calories...WOW! Iced is refreshing, and my husband likes to drink it hot.  I have shared this with friends, and recently we had some workmen at the house. It was a hot day and I gave them tall glasses of this tea with ice.  It was enjoyed by all!  Would recommend this product to everyone who likes iced tea."
"One of my local stores carried this product when it first came out. I am not a big ""honey"" person as far as taste, but this is just the correct amount of sweetness & taste. You won't even know you are drinking green tea. Just add it to your water bottle, carry extras in your car or purse. And it is even good with vodka!"
IF you have to avoid them avoid this tea - it also has artificial sweetener in addition to honey. It tastes like the flavored waters and that is before the ice starts to melt:)
I am hooked on Arizona Peach Iced Tea Stix. I have it on auto-deliver because if I run out a serious panic attack ensues. The Lipton tea was on a special so I decided to give it a try. SOOOO GOOOD! Even better than Arizona's. I like the hint of apricots. I really brings the favors all together. I would highly recommend.
"I feel very deceived by Lipton and the seller that they wrote that it is naturally sweetened by honey and when I received it, I noticed that it also has Sucralose in it.  Exactly what I was trying to get away from and avoid!  Artificial sweeteners!  Very unhappy with Lipton and this seller.  And yes, I can taste the artificial sweetener in it!  The drink is okay but nothing special.<br />******** I would rate the drink on a a scale of ten, about a 7.<br />******** But I rate the seller here a zero, for not disclosing that it contained artificial sweetener also."
"I occasionally add powdered flavoring to try to encourage myself to drink more water.  While I'm not a big fan of green tea flavoring, I do enjoy the tastes of honey, blackberries, and pomegranates.  While that combination of flavors sounds interesting, I really did not enjoy the final result. I think my taste buds were a bit confused.  It might be nice to try this if you love all the flavorings listed, but I will stick to the more basic flavors."
"This stuff tastes like pomegranate and starts off tasting sweet, but once swallowed one can taste the artificial sweetener.  I don't taste the tea, though, and that's fine with me.<br /><br />One packet fills up a 16-ounce bottle.  That's the perfect solution to me as making this 8 ounces as directed is too powerful for me.  The packets are easy to tear open, and obviously easy to carry in a backpack or day bag."
I enjoyed this drink. Its nice to have the packets in my purse that I can ad to water at work. Has been helpful in helping to reduce the soft drinks. Nice taste as well. Low calorie and tasty! Provides a variety to what you drink and is cost effective!
"When I first drank this, I used one small package for an iceless mug. Unfortunately, without the ice it was too overpoweringly sweet. Taste-wise it didn't taste as much like brewed tea and instead tasted like the typical sweet tea that comes out of a soda tap machine.<br /><br />It tasted good w/ a mango taste if not tea like. I'd recommend it only to be used in small amount rather than the entire package per cup."
"In an effort to drink more water, I be been drawn to instant stir in flavors, flavors in drops, and plain flavored water.  Don't get me wrong.... I like water when I'm hot and thirsty, but to just drink all those glasses of water each day (as recommended) gets pretty boring to me.<br /><br />I do love iced tea, but again there's that whole brewing thing, and the instant has a strange after taste.<br /><br />Not with this Lipton Great Tea mix!.<br /><br />Easy to use, just tear off the top and pour.  You can stir it in a glass, or just dump it into your water bottle and shake.<br /><br />It mixes easily, dare I say you can take it with you and use it in restaurant water rather than ordering a soft drink?<br /><br />But it tastes great!  NO after taste!!<br /><br />I plan to purchase more of this product.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF"
"I liked it -- You can't really make out that there is any honey in this product taste wise (flavor) -- Whole foods and even Walmart have Stevia sweetened drinks that taste pretty good and are all natural, I prefer those as a koolaid substitute for my kids.  Definitely reminds you of KoolAid.  Its extremely sweet, but does have a tart pom feel to it.  But I have to admit, I like and and it gets me to drink more fluids.  I think you could ideally mix with 24 oz and not 16 oz as recommended on the package since its pretty sweet.  Has a lot of coloring but seems like natural color."
"When I saw the flavor Mango Pineapple, I had to try this. These are the small packages that you can take on the go and mix in water bottles; the 16-ounce bottles of water is what is recommended. I'm on a plan that was set up by my Nutritionist and in this plan, sugar is a big no-no. This drink is perfect because it has an artificial sweetner in, that's close to splenda, and there's no aftertaste. For a drink with artificial sweetner, the taste is great! This is a real good sweet tea substitute and I'm glad that I decided to try it."
"I like these, they taste good, they are easy to fix, my work has filtered water and it's nice to have a fresh refreshing drink without really having to pay anything extra<br /><br />these are quick and easy to fix, taste great, and are very convenience, obviously it would be nice if they were a bit cheaper, but thats why we buy in bulk.<br /><br />pretty good, im happy and was worth the experience"
"This sugar-free berry-flavored ice tea has a refreshing taste.  With separate powder packages intended for single servings, this is a product that's perfect for use at the office or on travel.  My only complaint is that the amount of power seems excessive for a sincle serving, making it difficult to dissolve the entire packet even in a pint-sized glass and leaving unwanted residue in the glass."
"This tastes like a tropical cocktail... all it needs is the alcohol (didn't try adding that).  The mango flavor is pungent and if you like that flavor, you will like this tea.  Very enjoyable taste."
"This is not the ideal or the most nutritious of drinks, but if it stops you from drinking sugary drinks, then it is definitely an alternative to consider.<br /><br />The taste is mostly strawberryish in a Kool Aid kind of way. I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.<br /><br />Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink. If you find it too rich, you can always increase the amount of water or use one packet to make drinks for multiple people.<br /><br />One packet has 10 calories, all sugars. There is no other nutritional value on the label.<br /><br />If you are cautious about artificial sweeteners, this one has sucralose.<br /><br />The green tea is decaf, and indeed I did not feel a caffeine kick.<br /><br />The outside box is nice and colorful, but the drink definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />The bottom of the outside box and the individual packets show an expiration date, but it is not written in a straightforward fashion from a consumer's perspective.<br /><br />The overall rating is closer to 3.5 stars out of five, but closer to a 4 than a 3. It gets bonus points for reasonable taste and convenience, but sucralose brings it down."
"I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product."
"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?"
"The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is."
"I wanted to like this, but I didn't. It was too sweet and in fact it didn't taste much like tea to me. I feel bad about saying this, because I'm a Lipton Tea lover. I make iced tea by putting three tea bags in a two quart bottle and setting it in the sun for a day and that kind of iced tea is so very much better than this. Sorry, Lipton, I wanted to like this, but I didn't, not a bit."
"I was so excited to get this through the Vine program as it sounded delicious.  I love nearly all drinks that contain blackberry or pomegranate so I thought this would be a home run.  What a disappointment!  I cannot even describe the taste aside from to say it is very artificial.  The clean crisp natural taste that was expected never occurred throughout the two packages that I drank.  The smell was even artificial.  In fact when I first smelled it, I nearly dumped it down the drain.  It also took some time and a lot of shaking for all of the particles to dissolve into the water.  I did not enjoy this product and will probably not buy or even finish the remaining in the package that I have."
"This product has sugar, honey, sucralose, and maltodextrin. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame.<br /><br />On the front package it says:<br />Tea & Honey<br />Iced Green Tea: Blackberry Pomegranate Flavor with other Natural Flavor<br /><br />Back of package:<br />Liption Tea & Honey is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it is made with real ingredients<br />- sweetened with honey<br />- made from real tea leaves<br />- real fruit flavors<br />with 5 calories per 8 fl oz serving and no aspartame - you know it taste good!<br /><br />This product is being falsely advertised as all natural when Aspartame has the same problems as sucralose!<br /><br />You can NOT taste the tea, you can sorta taste the honey as a base. It taste just like Splenda. I was very disappointment because it did not taste like tea, but red juice made with splenda."
"I like the tubular packaging in concept, but it's not as convenient as one might hope, especially since the flavor of the tea is rather weak by my standards.  I'm not over the top on liking strong tea, but by the same token I do want some flavor without having to double the mix."
"I was very excited when I saw this product and it stated it was sweetened with honey.  I did not see anywhere that it also contained sucralose (sweetener) which I dislike very much until I actually received the product.  I also found out at this time that this is a purchase that cannot be returned to Amazon.  PLEASE, in the future, list all ingredients on products."
"very little of either, green tea or honey. It's mostly sweetner, real and artificial, with a touch of tea power. I was really disappointed."
"When I read the description, it said it was sweetened with honey. I didn't realize that just because it says on the box that it's sweetened with honey, doesn't mean it isn't sweetened with an artificial sweetener also! The company is clearly trying to mislead consumers by pretending it's somehow ""natural"" because it's sweetened with honey and doesn't contain aspartame, but the truth is that it has sucralose. I personally do not like consuming artificial sweeteners and I think it is ridiculous that this company is trying to mislead consumers."
"I really do like these Lipton To go Stix.  I've tried the Backberry/Pomegranite, Mango/Pineapple, and the Strawberry /Acai.  My favorite is the Mango but the strawberry is a close second.  They are convenient, just put one packet into a bottle of water, shake and go.  They completely dissolve and are only 5 calories.  Especialy with the weather getting hotter, I will be drinking a lot more of these."
"I tried both this flavor and the pomegranate version and while both were unpleasant, at least this one is somewhat tolerable.  By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for."
"The predominant flavor of this drink mix is blackberry with a hint of pomegranate.  I enjoyed this drink mix.  But I would have to say that the mango pineapple version of this is slightly better.  The sticks/packets are  also very convenient.  Each packet is just enough for a 16 ounce water bottle.  After a vigorous shake, the powder totally dissolves.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it is less than the Crystal Light drink mixes.  These are good for quick, on-the- go drinks."
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 3:18 Mins<br /><br /></span>The GOOD:<br /><br />* Conveniently-sized portions make for great drinks on-the-go<br />* Taste is excellent, if not too sweet.

"As far as dry iced tea mixes go, this is a very average product.  The flavor is light, not bold.  The honey sweetening is absent in taste.  It could have been blackberry or wild berry or any berry.  The packaging is very nice, however and makes for taking this with you in a purse or pocket.  Add to 16 oz of water and you have tea."
"Blackberry and pomegranate, green tea, and honey sounds like a lovely combination. Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise."
"I liked the flavor of this product.  It was fruity and a bit tart.  It doesn't really taste like ""iced tea"".  I know the green tea flavor is more mild, so if you are looking for an iced tea tasting beverage this isn't it.<br /><br />The serving size is half a packet to 8 ounces of water, so really what you are looking at is one packet to a normal sized water bottle (16.9 ounces) which puts it at 10 calories vs. 5.<br /><br />The product boasts ""No aspartame"" but it does contain sucralose, so it still has that artificial sweetner taste.  That doesn't bother me at all, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I found it dissolved quickly in the water and I wasn't dealing with undiluted chunks.<br /><br />This won't become my new beverage of choice or anything, but it's tasty and easy."
"This is a ready to go (instant) ice tea powder in 2 cup pouches. It's real easy to make - you can drop the contents of each pouch in to either a bottle of water or two cups of water and you have ice tea. It dissolves fairly easily even in cold water. The ingredients include honey and sugar, citric acid, green tea, sucralose, maltodextrin, hibiscus extract and beta carotene. The mango and pineapple flavors are very subtle and do not influence the taste too much. It's great and refreshing on a summer afternoon."
"I like this blackberry pomegranate iced green tea almost as much as I liked the mango pineapple. It's also full of flavor, very sweet and has only 5 calories and 10mg of caffeine per 8 ounce serving.<br /><br />Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey) citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetner), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids.<br /><br />Simply delicious and I appreciate that it's low in sugar and carbs."
"I really like the ""on the go"" mixes that are single or double servings in a tube. I drink the Ocean Spray and Crystal Light ones all the time. I like iced tea so I figured that I might like this too. That wasn't the case. I found this didn't mix in as well and while it smelled awesome, the favor just wasn't there for me. It smelled like strawberries but didn't really taste like them. There was maybe a hint of strawberries when you first take a drink but the after taste from the green tea didn't really work for me. I think I'd skip these next time."
"I've had a number of instant drink packet mixes in the past from various vendors.  This, Lipton Iced Green Tea mix, is similar in the fact that it comes in a box of 10 packets, each ready to mix into a 16.9 oz. bottle of water or a like-sized glass of water.  I used it in a glass, stirring with a spoon, and it dissolved quickly for me.  I found it to be quite strong even with added ice, and ended up adding more cold water to suit my taste. I thought the flavor was good.  I could taste the honey, blackberry, and pomegranate flavors but found it was a bit overly sweet, and this comes from a confessed sugar junkie. Still, I enjoyed it after adding the water and would choose it again.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, a serving is only 8 ounces, though you mix each packet in a 16~oz. bottle of water.  I can't imagine what the purpose of making this distinction is, other than to qualify the ""5 calories per serving"" claim on the front of the box.  Would 10 calories a serving be a deal breaker for most people?<br /><br />There are no other noted nutrition values besides 1 gram of sugar and 10 mg of caffeine per serving.  It states that each 8 ounce serving contains 60 milligrams of flavonoids, which is more than cranberry juice and almost twice that in orange juice.  From an internet reference, ""Flavonoids have antioxidant activity. Flavonoids are becoming very popular because they have many health promoting effects. Tea flavonoids have many health benefits. Tea flavonoids reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, lowers the blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.""<br /><br />To summarize, I enjoyed this drink and would purchase it again.  It is convenient, tasty, and provides a few health benefits."
"I'm an iced tea lover, and I enjoy most varieties, including green tea.  I tend to prefer plain/lemon teas to other fruit types, however, but I still decided to give this product a try, as I liked the idea that the tea is sweetened only with honey (i.e., no artificial sweeteners).  According to the packaging, each 8 oz. serving has 5 calories and 10 m.g. of caffeine.<br /><br />I really love the convenience of the little individual packets!  They are easy to tear open, and you could toss one in your bag/purse or bring them to work (which is what I did).  The dry crystals dissolve nicely in water.  For my own tastes, the tea was a bit too fruity--although it didn't taste like fruit punch (which is what I don't like about some fruit-flavored teas), you can definitely taste both the berry and pomegranate flavors.  However, I could also discern a tea taste as well as a touch of honey.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good product, and I would definitely recommended it to those who enjoy fruit teas."
"I tried this Strawberry Acai Decaf Green Tea Mix along with my two daughters ages 10 & 12. My 10 year old didn't care for it, on the other hand, my 12 year old liked it and said it tastes like liquid strawberry jello. A serving size is 1/2 a packet and 8 oz of water, only 5 calories, and 1 gram of sugar. It is sweetened with honey and also sucralose. It is perfect for the 16.9 oz water bottles which would be double the serving if you are counting calories but still only 10 calories and 2 g of sugar. It does say it's Decaf Iced Green Tea, strawberry acai flavored. I don't taste any iced tea at all, if you like strawberry flavored drinks then you'd probably like it, because strawberry is definitely the only flavor you taste. It's great drink for kids being so low calorie and so low in sugar as compared to the usual juices for kids and the packets are also very easy to open. I only gave it 3 stars because for me it just wasn't the flavor I was looking for, I wanted to be able to taste the iced tea. I would try a different flavor or maybe just the plain iced tea."
"I was curious to try this, as the ""Honey"" part caught my eye. I have tried the previous edition that had the aspartame, and it had a strange aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. I like to have little packets like this to keep in my purse or in the car though, and the flavor sounded pretty good.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I read the box. I wanted to see what the ingredient list was. And so I must say, if you're looking for something with no artificial sweetener at all - BEWARE. This does not have aspartame, but it DOES have sucralose (otherwise known as SPLENDA). I was a bit disappointed when I read that, as I was hoping it was just honey as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I went ahead and made some - I even measured out the 16.9oz so that my initial taste-test could be as accurate as possible. I smelled the packet when I first opened and could definitely smell the mango. The pineapple was less pronounced. Then I the water in a glass container with a lid (I wanted to see how well it dissolved). One good shake and I could still see some bits (probably the honey) floating around. Two more really good shakes and other than a small bit in the bottom, it was all dissolved. I opened the lid of the container and took another smell - again, very strong mango, with a bit of pineapple. It smelled really good. As for the taste - it lives up to the smell. I really like it. I don't get any aftertaste from the sucralose, and the fruit flavors are not too strong. It's not overly sweet, though that is individual taste and can be easily fixed by adding a bit more water.<br /><br />Overall, despite my disappointment with the addition of sucralose (which is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5), I would happily buy this. It tastes delicious, can be adjusted for taste, dissolves easily, and is convenient to carry around."
"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton."
"If you are thinking this ice tea is sweetened with honey only don't buy it.  Yes, it has honey as a sweetener but it's ""honey granules (sugar, honey.)"" As well, other sweeteners are sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt.  These ingredients are not disclosed in the description but they are on the package.  I have no idea how it tastes because I didn't taste it; my preference is not to ingest chemical sweeteners or sugar.  In addition, one 8-ounce serving has 10 mg caffeine; one packet is two servings.<br /><br />I'm only giving this product 1-star because of  lack of disclosure.  When I read the description in the Vine Newsletter I was under the impression this product was sweetened with honey only. This is not the case.  If you don't mind sugar or chemical sweeteners then I suggest you read other reviews about flavor."
"Ok, so I don't normally use strong language but after receiving a free sample of Lipton Mango Pineapple Iced Green Tea Mix I couldn't spit far enough.  Sweetened with honey?  Right. Read the fine print. This is a cocktail of artificial and ""natural flavor"", stuff that should never be in a fine brew. It leaves an after taste that just won't go away and to put it nicely, well . . I can't put it nicely. Awful awful stuff! This one doesn't deserve a rating."
"I really don't know why they made the tea ridiculously sweet. With that much sugar in the tea, they will make obesity worse in the US. If you care about your health, stay away from such product."
This Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix with blackberry and pomegranate is delicious. The single pack is perfect to fill a water bottle with delicious flavor. It is easy to use too! All you have to do is tear the easy-to-tear packet and pour it in. The bag is small enough to allow you to pour the package's contents easily into the bottle without spilling it. I highly recommend this delicious beverage.
these are the best super yummy and i never get sick of the flavor. a little bit pricey but not filled with sugar
water is good for you but can't drink as much as dr. want to drink can with the lipton tea and it taste great.  will keep up.
I realy like this tea. It is very easy to mix. Has a great taste. Got it for a very good price from Amazon
"I'm so happy to find a really good tasting drink mix that's low calorie but made with better ingredients! No artificial colorings, and no aspartame! Thank you Lipton! I'm now a devoted customer! I would have given it five stars but there is sometimes a packaging flaw when the packets are crumpled in the box and hard to remove without several coming out at once."
"This tea is great.  It was a gamble buying it without trying it, but kids and I are very glad I did.  This is ONLY for those who love a very sweet, fruity tea."
"My wife and i love this, it tastes great and it healthier then sodas. would definitely purchase again. maybe even try other flavors."
"Product is pretty good for instant tea. Taste is OK. Only problem is that I had to buy 10 pk (12/pk) to get it because it was not available in my local store. Oh well, it will last quite a while."
"I usually don't like sweetened teas but this is really good. I will try the other flavors as well, we keep a gallon in the fridge at all times."
"I got this on a gold box deal.  The deal was twelve boxes with ten mixes in each box. That adds up to 120 mixes for the whole order.  The directions say to mix one individual packet to a one liter bottle of water.  I found that it was too sweet for my taste.  I mix one packet in an empty one quart power drink bottle and I find this palletable to my tastes.I enjoy the flavor so I mix several quart bottles and partially freeze them and have plenty of water bottles to drink while I work outdoors in this heat and keep me hydrated all day long. They also had a coupon for $3.00 off the order.  I ended up paying $12.00 that makes me 120 quarts of this drink mix.  To me, that is a bargain.  I hope others got this incredible bargain."
"I bought the ""Black Currant Raspberry Black Tea"" flavor and like it. The primary flavor is the fruit, but you can also taste the black tea under it. I saw some people complaining about not enough tea flavor in the green tea based flavors, but I think the problem is just that green tea naturally has a light flavor. Since this one uses a black tea, it is not a problem.<br />I also tried the ""Blackberry Pomegranate Green Tea."" I don't mind the flavor, but it is much more like Koolaid, with a very strong sweet pomegranate flavor and little tea flavor."
"I love the Mango Pineapple Stix! It's a great balance between a sweet tea and juice (tastes great with vodka too). I was suprised by how many were here too! There is a ton of these little stix. The taste is refreshing, my new favorite summer drink.<br /><br />Only complaints that do not give this a 5 star (not the taste, but the packaging:<br />1) There are literally 12 packs of 10 stix, lots of cardboard and wasted packaging. You'd think they'd be a bit more efficient and have them all in once box.<br />2) The tear to open each stix sometimes rips all the way down the packaging, getting powder everywhere. The first time I opened these, powder got everywhere. Crystal Light packets open across the top horizontally. These have the slit vertically, it's not good. Beware.<br /><br />Even with the horrible packaging, I love these and will be buying more!"
"I got a sample of the Mango/Pineapple flavored tea and really liked it a lot so I now buy this product regularly in the grocery store.  I am on the go a lot and like to keep a cooler of ice with bottled water in it in the back seat. Plain old water is just boring after a while. I do carry a bottle of home brewed iced tea with me but still I like to use the little to-go stix of all sorts from different companies and this is a very nice addition to my options.  I really liked the Mango one so I tried the blackberry/pomegranate one and liked it less. My favorites are the mango, peach, and strawberry ones.<br /><br />As a diabetic, I like to watch the calories and carbs and this is a refreshing way to flavor water without a lot of sugar. It is quite convenient to carry along to flavor water and tastes fruity. If you are avoiding sugary drinks , this is a good choice. Kids also love this and it is nice if you are having a fast food lunch with kids to carry along a cooler of ice with bottles of water and add their choice of Lipton To Go Stix to the water instead of buying tooth-rotting sugary sodas at restaurants. There is only one gram of carbs and it has 10% of your Vitamin A requirements (at least the Mango Pineapple one does). It is made with real green tea leaves instead of just artificial flavoring and green tea has health benefits.<br /><br />I recommend this product."
"I have purchased every one of the tea flavors they make. This is my personal favorite. The aroma is pleasing, the taste is refreshing and the overall experience is wonderful.<br />The honey is what makes it my first choice. I don't need to add Splenda or other additives. It is all natural which I consume frequently."
"While attempting to avoid aspartame flavored drinks I found the Lipton Tea with Honey in the Blackberry Pomegrante flavor.  It tastes good, although it can be a bit too sweet.  Instead of adding one package to 8 ounces of water I add it to 16 which makes it better.  The first ingredient is Honey Granules which is a combination of honey and sugar, and several ingredients later is Sucralose.  While I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners all together I do not mind Sucralose (generic for Splenda) as much as I dislike aspartame.<br /><br />It also has 60 mg of flavanoids per serving.  All in all I would recommend this product."
"As someone who drinks green tea every day at work, I thought this would be a good selection. It seemed to have everything I like: green tea, mango, honey. It does, but unfortunately, it also includes some non-desirables. For me, Sucralose is an unproven benefit and I generally avoid it if possible.<br /><br />It is too bad Lipton adds it to this tea. It over-sweetens the tea and adds the undesirable ingredient. I am used to the slightly bitter green tea taste and think covering it up takes away from the overall appeal. I would prefer a little more honey instead, but even then, I think unsweetened green tea is sellable as is. The mango flavor is about right, while I did not detect much, if any, pineapple flavor.<br /><br />Half a sachet is sufficient flavoring for a pint of water. Adding the entire sachet is excessive for my taste."
"Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.<br /><br />If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:<br /><br />1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.<br /><br />2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?<br /><br />I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.<br /><br />Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real."
"Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple offers a fresh-tasting sweet tea that registers only five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product comes in a small box, packed in ten handy flutes.  It is, the manufacturer states, made from real tea leaves and contains 60 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with honey, and real fruit flavors.  It is, as well, easy to prepare.  You can add a packet to one bottle (16.9 fl. oz. of water), or half a packet to an eight ounce glass of water: just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  It's obviously a handy thing to keep on hand for the office, the gym, the backpack, or anywhere you are on the go.  I've found it a handy pick-me-up when I am hot, thirsty, and tired.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love mango Margaritas, figure somebody snuck that recipe out of paradise.  The pineapple taste here does add a bit of tartness, too.  However, in the list of ingredients I find sucralose and corn maltodextrin as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  (Of course, I've no idea what might be in the mango margarita mix that bars use, so..)  I'm not a dietitian, just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know."
"This looks like a ""good for you"" product, what with the honey and green tea and acai and all, but I was disappointed to find sucralose (artificial sweetener) on the ingredients list. I love the convenience of having a tube of powder to pour into my water bottle and shake... and I did like the taste, but I probably won't be buying more because of the sucralose."
"I like the ease of the packaging of these to go packets and have also used these to make a liter of the tea at home using two packets.  I prefer my drinks to be sweetened naturally and glad to see these have honey rather than other sugar substitutes.  The flavor is a bit lacking when compared to juice but given that it is a tea, it's a good alternative to plain water or whenever you want a beverage which is low calorie and refreshing."
"Instant iced teas have never been able to approach the depth of flavor of a good home-brewed tea, but if you're looking for something quick and easy to mix up in your water bottle before you head out to the gym, these single-serving packets can't be beat for decent flavor, convenience, and adding hardly any caloric load to your workout quaff."
"If you like ice tea and green tea and don't mind subtle flavors of blackberry & pomegranate & honey, then you will like this product.  It is refreshing and just toned down enough that you can put it in your mountain bike water bottle and do a serious work out to be followed by an enjoyable re-hydration. I will definitely buy this product again."
"""Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai"" is a pretty good low calorie drink. It has a very strong strawberry taste. I do not notice any hint of honey or green tea though. The strawberry flavor pretty much overpowers everything else. Although the strawberry flavoring is natural, it does taste similar to artificial flavored drinks such as Kool-Ade. It also does have a moderate aftertaste. It's not as bad as some other sugar free soft drinks, but it is noticeable. I also find the drink tastes better if you add more than the recommended amount of water. If you like drinking sugar free soft drinks such as Diet Snapple, etc., you'll probably like ""Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai"". If you're not a fan of diet drinks, you probably won't due to its aftertaste."
"I usually drink Crystal Light and my favorites tend to be the simple flavors. This was neither and that was good.<br /><br />First off, it is 10 calories per packet - it says 5 calories per 8oz serving size but there are 2 servings per packet and it is intended for a regular 16.9 fluid oz bottle of water and I really dislike when marketing tries to get all tricky like that.<br /><br />Adding the dry contents of the packet to my bottle of water I was initially worried because it was taking longer to dissolve than I was used to with the Crystal Light packets and I was worried I was going to have little gritty stuff at the bottom of my bottle - Didn't happen.  All the ""grit"" dissolved perfectly - it just took a minute longer.<br /><br />The taste initially was too sweet and I got immediately the taste of pineapple and mango (I had just sipped the plain water though and almost anything after plain water is too sweet).  My second and third sips were much more to my liking.  I still got the mango and pineapple sweetness right away but the taste after that was more mellow with the hints of honey and green tea.  I normally don't like green tea but the sweetness of the pineapple and mango and honey really lessened the bitter taste I sometimes get with green tea.<br /><br />All in all I really liked the smooth taste of it."
"My family loves this product - it has a strong and natural blackberry/pomegranate flavor, and we appreciate the natural honey sweetening.  It dissolves and mixes easily, and it's great for flavoring your bottled water, but our favorite way of drinking it has become as a flavoring for our ""Sodatream"" carbonating machine."
"If you're a fan of Green Tea flavored with Honey, then you'll love the new single serving Lipton To Go Stix mixes.  I sampled the Blackberry Pomegranate variety and found it very pleasing.  The Blackberry flavoring comes through as the ""top note"", but then quickly yields to the iced tea and honey ""bottom note"".  The effect is refreshing and stimulating.  I appreciated the fact that it is low calorie (5 per serving), and the idea that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than aspartame (the latter sometimes gives me a slight headache).  Overall, I much prefer fresh-brewed iced tea to the instant variety, but when you're on the run and want a convenient and tasty alternative, this is a great choice.  Highly Recommended."
"Mixed it up and had a glass. Liked the flavor as did some of my family members, but I'm really not fond of the sucralose in it, hence the reason for only 4 stars. I was under the impression that it was sweetened with honey and that turned out to be only partially true."
"This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating. I don't like getting chunks of the powder through my straw as its a bit shocking!"
"I liked the blackberry and pomegranate flavoring which was sweet and strong with no bad aftertaste. I didn't taste much tea which seemed to be overpowered by the fruit flavors and the honey. Using it as directed, one packet to one 16.9 oz bottle of water, produced a very intense flavor. Using a little less than one packet, or a larger water bottle, provided a better taste for me. If one likes very sweet, use the whole stick. The powder mixes quickly after shaking vigorously for about 30 seconds. I liked it enough to get it again. It's one of the better water enhancers I've tried."
"I love anyhing pomegranite!  Its not too strong and not too week, perfect for a 16ounce bottle of water and can be carried in a purse or briefcase without breaking and spilling all over!"
"I like experimenting with different drinks, and I found these ready to make ice tea mixes to my taste.  They really have the mango flavor, without a significant aftertaste. The powder itself dissolves without buildup. So overall it's a good ice tea product.<br /><br />(Be sure to have good water ratio, though. For example I like it stronger, thus I use less water than the recommended amount).<br /><br />However, buying this separately is not a good option, especially when amazon offers good discounts when you buy in bulk with the ""subscribe and save"" program. For example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NVBI"">Pack of 4</a>, or even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBIHPM"">good old canister based mixes</a> -- though the second one is not the same exact flavor."
"I like the ease with which you can use this item.  It has a good taste, but I would have perfered a little more honey and a little less acai flavoring.  It was slightly bitter and did give me heartburn.  But other than that it had a good taste and I would recommend it to a friend."
"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a package that I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />Well, it's OK. I probably wouldn't buy it, but I don't usually buy instant iced tea mixes anyway.<br />The fruit flavor is OK. I can't comment on the naturalness vs unnaturalness of the ingredients etc like other reviewers.<br /><br />I'd probably just brew my own fresh green tea and chill it in the fridge..."
"Lipton To Go Green Tea & Honey Mango Pineapple was a nice new discovery. I usually buy Crystal Light products, but I may very well buy Lipton products from now on. My friend described this drink as ""green tea with a bit of mango,"" but my description would be a bit different. While I do love green tea, it can be slightly bitter at times. This had none of the bitterness. Actually, the green tea flavor was very subtle. To me, it tasted more like a tropical fruit punch, with mango as the dominant flavor. With only 5 calories, you really can't go wrong. All in all, I was really impressed with this product, and I will most likely be buying it again in the future."
"I am a fan of Lipton Iced Green Tea so when I say the new Lipton Tea and Honey Decaf Iced Green Tea on Vine I had to give it a try.  The flavor is great and it fits the bill for anyone does not want artificial sweetener in their drink.  There is a trade off.  While the original Iced Green Tea had no calories, The Tea and Honey has 5 calories per serving.  Another plus is that while there is soy lecithin in the The Iced Green Tea there is none in Tea and Honey.  While some people say that soy in lecithin form does not bother people who are sensitive  to soy not having to worry about soy is nice.  I got the Strawberry Acai flavor and found it mild and enjoyable.  I did notice that it took longer for the Tea and Honey mix to dissolve but that was a minor problem.  I will be switching to the Tea and Honey now that it is available."
"First off, buyers be warned that it's a low-calorie drink, which means it has that ""diet taste.""  If you've had any diet drinks, like Diet Coke, you'll know what I'm talking about.  I know some people hate it, so if you're one of those, I doubt this will change your mind.  Also, I know some people like unsweetened iced tea, so take note that this is (artificially) sweetened.<br /><br />That said, my wife and I really like it!  The one we tried was the mango-pineapple flavor, which was really refreshing.  The box comes with ten packets, with each packet for one 16-oz. bottle of water.  As one reviewer pointed out, one bottle of water wasn't enough, and it was a little too sweet for our taste, too, but when we used more water (about an extra 8 oz.) and put in some ice cubes it was perfect!  The mango taste is stronger than the pineapple, but it has a great tropical iced-tea taste to it.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, so with spring and summer around the corner, I'm glad to have come across this on Vine.  It is a great, refreshing drink for a hot day and I like that my wife and I can each have a decent serving size from the single packet and just think--now we're getting half the calories of an already low-cal drink!  Of course, your mileage may vary, but if you drink diet sodas or juices, give this a try!"
"Blackberry and Pomegranate flavor was already a hit with me. My opinion is exactly the same with Mango Pineapple. Good strong Lipton flavors, very sweet for the sweet tea lovers, but I like mine less so, thus, here's what I do.<br /><br />I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. The flavor was fruity, as good as I expected after trying another flavor earlier. I've tried lots of flavored teas from other makers and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton. This is different, it's good.<br /><br />IT'S HEALTHY, BUT IT CAN BE MADE EVEN BETTER (IF NEEDED.)<br />FOR 8 OZ (that's half a packet, as the packet makes over 16 oz.) you get ZERO Fat & Sodium. Sugar's only 1g (per 8 oz.), calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me.<br />After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. By doing this you cut the nutrituion facts in half (per 8 oz serving). WOW. Even better. Now the bold Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate and or mango Pineapple flavor is still there, but less sweet. I enjoy the drink's fizz from the soda. Remember equal club soda/water mixed with the same amount of Lipton mixed as directed has a serving size (8oz) calorie cut to 2 ½, sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br />I'm sold, 2 flavor attempts and both very satisfying to me. Now, which flavor should I try next?<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and ""Bob's your Uncle""."
Lipton Tea and Honey is delicious. I enjoyed it very much. It is very sweet and refreshing. There are only 5 calories but it is so rich in flavor. The fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are strong and delightful. I also like that is has real sugar and not aspartame. I would say it is almost addictive; I enjoyed it so much. I would recommend it to all. The packets are snipped for easy opening. You just add one packet to a 16 oz bottle of water and stir. It takes a minute to dissolve and then you can drink.
"Every single week I buy a new box of water flavoring for my family. We have a hard time finding ones that don't have artificial flavoring and colorings, and usually when we DO find one they taste awful. But this new Lipton product has made my whole family so happy! It tastes AMAZING without any nasty after taste, it's low in calories, but I feel great knowing that it's got all-natural sweeteners and colors in it. I will never buy a different kind of water flavoring again!"
"I usually drink regular iced tea--unsweetened and usually decaf if I can get it--but I decided to give it a try.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea.  The sweetness from the honey and blackberry disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />I should probably note I haven't really used the product how it says to.  Instead of putting one packet in a bottle of water, I dumped seven packets into about 2-3 quarts of water.  Maybe that makes the taste stronger than in a single bottle.  Myself I don't really have a need for a single 16.9-oz bottle of tea, but other people might.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all."
"I drink a ton of water every day, but I like to mix it up.  I've tried a few of the Mio drinks, but they can be quite expensive.  Green tea is an excellent antioxidant, so I like to drink it as much as possible.  The strawberry-acai flavor is really nice, bright and sweet, but because of the use of honey/mix of sweeeteners, it tastes quite different than a product using white sugar.  It's 10 calories per full packet (serving size, as listed on the package, is half a packet or 5 calories), but a whole packet will make at least 16 oz. of flavored water- more if you're like me, since I tend to prefer it watered down a bit more.  Overall, this is a great way to add variety to one's daily water intake.  I'll be adding it to my pantry on a regular basis.<br /><br />Update 4/4/12: It was brought to my attention that this contains artificial sweeteners.  If you do not want that in your diet, please avoid this product.  If you're like me, and don't mind artificial sweeteners and use them sparingly, this drink will be in your wheel house."
"When I try a powdered drink mix, I am interested in three factors: First, I want the stuff to taste good.  Second, I want it to dissolve well.  Third, I'd rather drink something without a lot of calories.  This drink satisfied all three conditions for me, so I would be interested in buying more in the future.<br /><br />The drink tastes good.  It's a little sweet for one packet mixed into a drinking glass, but there are enough fruit flavors to make the sweetness a bit complex and worth tasting.  I didn't taste the pineapple at all, but the mango flavor was nice and pronounced, not quite overwhelmed by the honey taste.  It doesn't taste like home-brewed iced tea, but it was closer than I expected from a powdered mix.<br /><br />The box warns that the powder needs some extra mixing to fully dissolve, but I had no problem at all stirring it in a glass for a couple of seconds.  There was no grainy layer at the bottom of the glass, and my drink was smooth.<br /><br />Finally, each packet is only ten calories, so this still counts as a viable low-calorie alternative to soft drinks.  There are lower calorie sweeteners out there, but ten is close enough to zero that this mix is a viable beverage for those who prefer to drink water most of the time.<br /><br />This is not a must-drink experience, but it's very good by powdered drink mix standards, and I recommend it."
"I love these convenient little packets that you can add to water anywhere to create a tasty drink. This particular Lipton product is great if you want to get the benefits of green tea but you're not that fond of the flavor of green tea. What you get is mostly the tropical mango pineapple flavor and barely a hint of green tea. Although the tea is primarily sweetened by sucralose, the hint of honey makes this taste less artificial and more natural."
"Well, this one is simple.  The tea sticks are easy to pour and easy to drink.  I recommend a 24 oz glass and lots of ice.  Pour in the mix and stir.  Does take some extra mixing, but ice tea it is.  I was somewhat disappointed in the flavor however.  There was a tea undertone, but the basic taste was honey, which also overwhelmed the mango & pineapple, which was negligible.  I drank it all over 1/2 hour.  Iced tea more or less it is, but the honey flavor is king.  Of course, it is not ""sticky"" like real honey.<br /><br />I don't know.  I prefer others to this.  Maybe if the flavors were more balanced i would enjoy it.  I still prefer to make my own..."
"I tried this and I like it! I find it to be a refreshing drink. When I put a packet in a glass... I thought ""Kool Aid""! But it didn't have an artificial taste. I was afraid that it'd be too sweet for my taste but it was not... actually, I found it to be a perfect substitute for diet cola that I sip while working or playing at my computer. Give it a try... I think you'll like this easy to mix beverage."
"The Tea & Honey iced green tea with mango/pineapple flavor, with 5 calories, has an interesting taste, with a slight after taste that means artificial sweetener. The flavor itself tastes more pineapple than mango, both fruits that I like fresh, but nothing like the real fruit flavor, and frankly I prefer plain tea with lemon. I do like the ease of adding the packets to 16.9 fl. oz. of bottled water (cold from the fridge) and drinking the flavored bottle water later. Btw, be sure to shake it well so it all dissolves."
"87 degrees? In March? IN CHICAGO??????? Yeah, that's what we've been suffering through (some might say 'enjoying') these past two weeks in March 2012. Rather than lovely 50 degree weather and watching the tulips and magnolias SLOWLY begin to open up their buds, we're having SPRING ON STEROIDS, instead! So, break out the grill, the flip flops and the Iced Tea!!!<br /><br />My family and I go through copious amounts of tea. Being British, everything in life goes better with tea, either hot or iced. This Lipton product was a nice addition to our life-style and I hope they come out with different flavours to carry with you on hot days. We gave this a trial on a long hike in the dunes off of Lake Michigan. Had our supply of water bottles and the wee packets to add to them. Of 6 adults and 2 teens, this tea received a 4-5 star rating, over all. We enjoyed that it was actually sweetened with honey, rather than nasty fake sweetener. And we really enjoyed that you could taste that tart tea taste that we enjoy so much; it wasn't overshadowed by the fruit flavour.<br /><br />Normally, I don't enjoy products added to water as they turn out too sweet or just too ""too""...meaning TOO fruity, sweet, or whatever. This product nailed the perfect blend of turning water into something pleasant to drink, rather than needing plain water to WASH the taste of an added product off of your taste buds.<br /><br />Good Job, Lipton!!! Now, make a Honey and Mint version and I'll be a Happy Camper! :)"
"Full of flavor, but not calories...glad I got this, the honey gave it a wonderful taste...the box is cute and just fun to play with...I got it from The Vine and was sceptical, when it arrived 2 of my friends were here...we were all happy with this product over ice...I added a sprig of mint...found it very tasty- awesome water alternitive"
"I normaly do not reach for the decf items, and when this product arrived...I thought, oh gee...then, I thought how bad can it taste?  The taste was great.  Not overly sweet and  with a hint of honey. Just the right blend<br /><br />The packet that the power is contained, very easy to open,  unlike some of the other brands. The powder mixes well, unlike other brands.<br /><br />I recently had purchased the SodaStream soda maker, and use a liquid flavoring, I prepaired the carbonation in the bottle and poured in the Lipton packet ..... Oh boy!  It started to fizz and bubble and the color was a bright red like a strawberry! What a mess .... however, when it settled down the carbonation disapated and<br />I found that the ice tea had a rich light taste. Tip:  if your try this tea  carbonated  a light carbonation is advised ...Also, if you want a drink like a light water, just use less from the packet.  Refreshing and half the cost of flavored waters.<br /><br />The only down fall for this powdered tea is the color!  Scarlet Red, it stains if you spittle.. (bg).  Other than that, I will looking forward to our grocery store<br />has the new Lipton Ice Tea.<br />Diffently recommend this product."
Got this for my wife as she likes to add those flavor packets to her water. Of course I had to taste it and lo and behold it is great. Very sweet but lo-cal and no after taste. I am diabetic so I think I will buy these for me from now on.
"Lipton's Tea & Honey To Go Iced Tea Mix packets are a convenient way to drink healthy while on-the-go. The box contains ten (.14oz) packets. Just pour it in a bottle of water and volia! Instant green tea with a yummy taste perfect for a hot summer day. I sampled the Strawberry Acai flavor and thought it was delicious. I am tempted to try the other flavors like peach apricot or blackberry pomegranate. What I like best is that it doesn't contain aspartame like most of the flavor packets on the market today. With only 5 calories per serving, what's not to like? It is sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves, and real fruit flavors."
"In an ongoing effort to avoid diet soda during the day, I have turned more and more to liquid and powdered water enhancers.  They are often hit or miss in terms of taste, but I'm pleased to say that Lipton's ""Tea & Honey"" Strawberry Acai is a pretty solid product.  That said, be aware that this sweet drink tastes far more like a strawberry punch than it does tea.<br /><br />Obviously, for marketing purposes, Lipton is playing up the ""all-natural"" use of honey.  A quick glance at the ingredients, however, shows that while there is granulated honey on the list, there's also plain old sugar and, perhaps to add sweetness yet keep the calories down, the artificial sweetener Sucralose.  As a result, this is a very sweet-tasting drink.  It does, however, have a pleasant strawberry taste, and I'm primarily concerned about the taste.  One might argue, however, why a person should avoid diet soda if they are going to use a powdered mix that contains artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Another marketing ploy I noticed was that the ""5 calories per serving"" is actually two per packet, which cannot be resealed.  Essentially, you are supposed to pour the entire packet into a standard bottle of water and then, I guess, drink half (for a single serving).  I don't know anyone that would actually do this, so Lipton would be better off labeling this as ""10 calories per serving,"" which is far more accurate.  Lastly, the box warns that these drinks need to be shaken at length to dissolve the tea.  That's very true.  It took several minutes of solid shaking to make all those little tea granules disappear.  Don't shake and drink quickly unless you want grit in your mouth!<br /><br />These things aside, I did enjoy this sample and plan to use the entire box -- probably faster than anyone would recommend.  While not addictively delicious, it's more refreshing than bottled water and probably better for me than diet soda.  Give it a try!"
"In a word: Yummy.  The blend of flavors is quite unique and refreshing.  Even my wife thinks it's good, and she is not a fan of drinks containing artificial sweeteners.  Each packet is die-cut making it very easy to open, too (no spilling).<br /><br />Bottom line, this a full-flavored drink mix that makes a 16-oz bottle of water taste great.<br /><br />Mar 31, 2012 UPDATE:  Since reviewing the Mango Pineapple, we picked up the Blackberry Pomegranate and the Strawberry Acai Decaf varieties, as well.  All are absolutely tasty!"
"This stuff is delicious... and strawberry-flavored! As a diabetic I always want something to expand my options and this Strawberry Acai iced tea will do fine.  Low calorie (5), low carb (1g) and sweetened with both honey and Sucralose- an infinitely better alternative to Aspertame- this is something I'm gonna enjoy having around. And did I mention it's strawberry-flavored? :)"
"First, I had a hard time opening it. Then, the mix came out in a cloud or lumps. I admit that I tried this after having a packet in my car for while but then it is made to travel, right?<br /><br />The taste is OK but nothing exciting. If I thought about it, I could taste the tea and honey but mostly I tasted the sweet Kool-Aid type taste.<br /><br />I was excited to find this as I cannot tolerate artificial sweetner. The sweetner (besides honey) is made from sugar but is low cal. I'm not sure how that is going to work for me.<br /><br />Overall, not bad but not exciting."
"This is some outstanding, easy to mix and enjoy decaf iced green tea! It couldn't be easier to make--just add to a glass of some cool or chilled water and stir. The honey, mango-pineapple flavor is very refreshing and I really agree with people who write that it's even better than soda on a hot day--and we'll be getting hot days here in New York for the next several months so this couldn't have come to me at a better time!<br /><br />It's the taste that really wows me. It's smooth and not too sweet as others say; and the packets are small enough that I can easily carry a bunch with me and then buy (or bring with me) bottled cold water to mix it with. If you're on the run, I think mixing the powder into the water using a small swizzle stick should work.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product. It's a mere five calories so unless you're drinking huge amounts of it you certainly won't gain any weight--this is very good tea!"
If you like strawberry you'll like this. I like the blackberry a bit better but its a matter of personal taste. Liptons did a great job with the instant green tea flavor in this product. Clean and astringent and a nice green tea flavor.
"This flavor is the best in my opinion. Lipton's green tea flavor is good in this product, not too green-grass. It is a nice clean flavor, a bit astringent, which is a tea flavor. Not too sweet. Clean."
This is very tasty drink with the right amount of flavors.No flavor is overbearing and all leave a gentle taste.No aftertaste as well.Try it and if you like mango and pineapple you will love this....
"I am a tea drinker from way back.  I drink about three gallons of unsweetened tea every week.  Normally I prefer unsweetened tea but when I was offered this product I noticed that it said it was slightly sweetened.  I couldn't wait to make my first drink.  You take a bottle of cold water, tear open the packet and pour it into the bottle.  Replace the cap and shake.  This tea does take a little longer to mix so you have to give it quite a few shakes but that isn't a problem.  The taste is lovely.  It takes like tea and fruit.  Honey is used as the sweetener and there is just a little bit added so it isn't too sweet.  It's just perfect.  I guzzled that first drink down and now I'm working on a second... I'm going to put some packets in my purse so I can make tea when I'm out and about."
love this stuff... add it to brewed iced tea for sweetener or to your water bottle for quick iced tea!
I live in Washington and all they sell here are the individual serving packs of this tea. I have been buying the Walmart brand Peach Tea and it just doesn't come anywhere near the taste of this Lipton Tea. I was EXTREMELY stoked when I found out you can buy this through Amazon! This is my son and I's absolute favorite Peach Tea to drink! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! Also the price is UNBEATABLE!!
So easy to use.  Pour it in a standard water bottle and drink.  The flavor is delicious and it's very refreshing.
"I really like this.  Just FYI though, the directions say to add one packet of mix per quart of water.  That's really more like half a pitcher.  BUT, that seemed like a high ratio to me, so I just used one packet in my 2 qt pitcher, and it was plenty sweet.  In fact, I really can't imagine wanting to add any more mix.  So, double the water/half the mix, and it'll be great."
"This is really great stuff, tasting much like a fruit punch. If you're using it with a cup or glass, rather than a bottle of water, I strongly suggest having an inch or so of water in the bottom before you pour the packet in to avoid wheezy clouds of powder; not having a full cup also seems to facilitate mixing the powder, then you can fill the cup up. VERY tasty stuff!!"
"I'm sure the slow mixing was simply because we were mixing them in ice water, and everything dissolves slower in ice water. However, the flavor was very good, the product was convenient, and we will buy it for sure.  Excellent for camping."
"I am trying so hard to drink more water but I admit I hate the taste.  The Lipton To Go Green Tea Mix Mango Pineapple is my newest addiction.  It is amazing and so delicious!  I am totally addicted to it and have cut back my soda intake and am drinking way more water. The packets are convenient enough that I can carry them with me in my purse and I can even stretch one packet to two bottles of water without really sacrificing taste. I warn you though that these are addicting!  The flavor is sweet and rich, but not overpowering.  The best part is they are only 5 calories which is nothing compared to my usual can of soda."
I love that these are individualized for bottled water. I am picky about what I drink if only this had a green or white tea version I would be over the moon
"Lipton Green Tea to Go, blackberry/pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  Of course, I'm not a dietitian, I just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know."
"Love this Lipton tea. Strawberry Acia is the best one. I recommend it. In a 16 ounce water bottle its a bit strong for me, so a 20 ounce water is better or dont use the whole packet."
"I wasn't sure if I'd like something flavored with honey because I didn't want it to be overpowering, but I thought this was really good.  This tasted really fruity, with a hint of honey and tea.  If you're looking for a strong tea flavor you might not like this, but if you're looking for more fruity it would be a good choice."
"Lipton To Go Iced Tea crystals are a convenient way to enjoy iced tea anywhere you have water available.  Just pour it in a glass or better yet, a bottle and take it anywhere with you.  Because it is decaffeinated, you can enjoy it anytime without the worry of caffeine jitters.  It is also low-calorie(sweetened with sucralose,) so this might be your guilt-free beverage."
"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Gren Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple is a very refreshing drink on a hot day. These are very easy to use, just mix one stix with a 16.9 fl oz bottled water and you have a very refreshing drink. Lipton has provided high quality teas for many years and these fit in quite well with Lipton products. The crystals dissolve very quickly and had just the right amount of honey Mango and Pineapple for a very tasty and refreshing drink."
Excellent tea and fruit flavor. Just he right amount for sall water bottles. Definitely a recommended product. Nice and convenient pouch is easy to store.
"This decaf iced tea was really good!  I like the fact that you put your ice and water in a glass and pour the packet of Stawberry iced tea in and stir.  It isn't overly sweet.  It tasted good and was a great alternative to soda.  I like it better than the soda stream we have and is a lot less work to make.  If you like decaf iced tea and want a different taste other than black or green tea then this is a buy!  THIS IS AN UPDATE AS OF 6/18/12.  I purchased a case of Strawberry and a case of Blackberry/Pomegrante.  I love this drink and so easy to mix!  I have also put 2 of each in my purse so when we eat out I can drink this instead of soda pop.  I make sure I have a plastic spoon in my purse.  Hope those of you who would like to try it like it as much as I do.  My husband thinks it is a really smart idea, he likes it also.  We are saving money when we eat out!"
"This drink has some zip to it.  It's really tasty and I'm happy it dissolves easily, has vitamins, zero calories, is sugar free and is so convenient.  I keep these on hand at work to spruce up a plain bottle of water when I want some flavor.  These stix are really convenient to travel with too.  I can get a bottle of water anywhere and add the tea for a kick."
I love these. They get me to drink h20. I always have some in my purse. Great for traveling. Lemon is my favorite.
"I'm trying to drink less soda and more water, but most of the time, a plain glass of water is not that appealing, so I am always on the lookout for ideas to flavor it. This mango pineapple has a great taste, not too sweet. It has a slightly tropical taste but is not overpowering, even when mixed with a smaller bottle of water than what the directions specify. I took a couple of sips to allow shaking room, then add the powder. The packet is easy to open without spills, yet sturdy enough not to tear open in a handbag or pocket. It does take quite a bit of shaking to completely dissolve the powder, but nothing too difficult.<br />I will buy more of these. They sure help with my water intake without adding too many extra calories."
"This has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf.  i don't like drinking caffeine throughout the day.  I would recommend this as it's easy to carry with you in your purse, briefcase, or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water.  It only adds 5 calories though.  Great stuff."
I disagree with the previous review.  The Mango and Pineapple is better than all the other flavors.  I'll continue buying it as long as it's available.
"I love this product. The flavor is so delicious. I was a little concerned that it might be too sweet with the honey and strawberry, but it's really just delightful. At my office we keep To Go Stix in the break room for whoever to use and we have a new regular box on the shelf. Everyone loved the way this tasted. You should give it a shot, you'll be happy you did."
"Lipton to Go Iced Green Tea Honey Blackberry Pomegranate ...The ease of taking this tea with you comes first to mind.  A bottle of water, a slip of a package and away I go.<br /><br />The best part of this tea not only the connivance of travel, the cost but the taste!  Each and every one of the different flavors  I say ...Oh!  This is my favorite ..Actually All of the flavors are my favorite.<br /><br />The only draw back and it is minor, you have to really shake the powder to get it to smooth out.  Like I said a minor mention.<br /><br />When I first tested this tea, I looked but did not find them in any green grocery, now, well every where you look ...you find them.. I purchased  for my hubby, who keeps them with him while at work and myself to keep extra in the car... both of us enjoy the taste of the Lipton To Go Green tea with all the great flavors."
"By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable."
"This makes me think Kool-aid for grownups. It is  that deep red color and pretty sweet tasting. I was pretty impressed since I am not a huge powdered drink fan. And, I normally am all about plain water. But we had a week or so without juice in the house and this gave me a sort of juice-fix. I mostly drank it in a glass, so not all the little powder bits mixed in as well as they would have in a bottle of water.<br /><br />The way the little packets rip open is really nice, they are already sort of halfway torn for you, and at an angle, so the powder falls pretty neatly into the drink.<br /><br />I'd recommend these to someone who enjoyed falvoring their water."
"We drink a multitude of beverages in our house.  Everything from soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and flavored water, so we always enjoy giving new beverages a try.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix is a blend of tea, honey and strawberry acai that comes in a 10-Count box with each powdered package producing a 16 ounce drink.  Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Easy to make, just add water, stir/shake and you're done.<br /><br />+ Convenient for travel.<br /><br />+ Good way to add flavor to water.<br /><br />+ 5 calories per 8 ounce serving.  One packet makes a 16 ounce serving.<br /><br />+ No aspartame.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Contains sucralose.<br /><br />- Doesn't really taste like tea.  Tasted more like strawberry Kool-Aid or Jell-O to me.<br /><br />- May be a bit too sweet for some.<br /><br />Powdered ""On-The-Go"" drink mixes always seem to be hit or miss in our house.  Most of the time they taste terribly artificial or too tart/sweet for our tastes.  Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix was no exception.  It tasted very little like any flavored tea I've ever tried.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for a sweet and refreshing drink.  However, I think many people will have difficulty equating the flavor of this drink mix with tea."
"Decided to try this on the Vine.<br />It tastes like weak strawberry flavored koolaid.  It would even be better if mixed with soda water to give it some kind of soft drink appeal.  I tried serving it to the rest of my family including kids and not a single glass was more than half consumed.  Save your money and try another kind/flavor.  I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.  This is so disappointing in comparison.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect green tea to taste strong like black tea, but the tea in this drink is virtually flavorless.<br /><br />Bottom line:  wouldn't buy it again."
"They keep saying ""naturally sweetened with honey"", but it is like sweetener overkill with sucralose.  Way too sweet, overwhelms any berry flavor that is there, and no green tea flavor is discernable.  Diluting it makes the oversweetened taste become obvious as the berry flavor recedes in the distance, with still too much sweetener.  (Though if you like things extra sweet, you may enjoy this).<br /><br />Too bad.  Try the True Lemon family of unsweetened dehydrated citrus juice packets instead."
"The box proclaims ""Sweetened with Honey"", and honey granules are listed as the first ingredient, so I thought, finally, something that is just lightly sweetened.  Uh, no, once I tasted it I double checked the fine print ingredients and saw that there is Sucralose in it.  While honey granules might be the largest ingredient by volume, by taste, it is overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener.  When a maker is so deceptive in the presentation of the product, it makes me wonder what else is misleading in it.<br /><br />I tried diluting it, in order to reduce the sweetness.  Well, the berry flavor receded into the background, but it was still too sweet.  Too bad.....<br /><br />It tastes like punch, and the convenience factor is great.  I love the way there are so many of these little single serve water flavors available now, but the artificially sweetened ones are way too sweet, as is this one.  For now I stick to True Lemon unsweetened, and the other unsweetened flavor products from that company.<br /><br />If you like drinks to taste sweet, with a sweetness that lingers in your mouth for many minutes after taking just a sip, you'll probably like this product."
"...so I drink mine diluted.  These sticks are meant for 16 ounce water bottles, but I empty a stick into a one (1) liter empty bottle which I fill with water from my Mavea water pitcher.  It still tastes heavy on the pineapple; in fact, I don't notice any mango or tea flavors at all. There is a ""too sweet"" aftertaste, also."
"I don't like to drink sodas because they really aren't good for you.  Water can get boring, so I thought this might be good.  I saw what was printed on the box, ""blackberry pomegranate flavor with other natural flavor, no aspartame"".  Hey, that sounds good, but further box reading shows it contains sucralose, here is one comment I found about sucralose:  According to the book Sweet Deception, sucralose is made when sugar is treated with trityl chloride, acetic anhydride, hydrogen chlorine, thionyl chloride, and methanol in the presence of dimethylformamide, 4-methylmorpholine, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetic acid, benzyltriethlyammonium chloride, and sodium methoxide, making it unlike anything found in nature. If you read the fine print on the Splenda web site, it states that ""although sucralose has a structure like sugar and a sugar-like taste, it is not natural.""  That kind of ruins this drink mix for me.  If a company (Lipton) wants to put Natural all over its packaging, then be natural all the way, not just a few ingredients."
"I LOVE tea!  I love Lipton tea! I do not love Lipton To Go Stix tea...  Lipton's new ""To Go"" Stix are a great idea for travel and the flavor of the tea and fruits together are great. However, the sweetener used in this product is not so great.  I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, especially sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose IS an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar),twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame and BOY does it show.  I tried mixing this in different quantities of water and just did not enjoy it one bit.<br /><br />If the product was REALLY sweetened with honey, I would certainly enjoy it more. These packets are ACTAULLY 10 calories as opposed to the stated 5 as each stick is labelled for 8 oz instead of 16 oz.  There is also a problem in the dissolving properties of the sucralose.<br /><br />Purchase at your own risk..."
"This decaf iced-tea mix reminds me of Kool-Aid.  In order to make it taste like something, it tastes like a drink mix--too sweet and not very much like tea.  It's one of those products that people buy because of clever marketing -- green tea, decaf, low calorie, honey and Acai-- what could be better?  Actually none of it is good.  Lots of artificial sweeteners, no real honey to speak of, and an overly sweet taste.  Not healthy.  Not that great."
"Tried this tea because it was in an isle (not on a shelf) in the grocery store.<br />After trying the tea was sold on the taste and being only 5 calories I was again sold.<br />Just as good as a cola and trying to lose a few pounds, can't be better.<br />Diet cola can't stand the after taste. No after taste with the tea and the taste is delicious."
"Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix in Blackberry Pomegranate is a delicious addition to a bottle of water.  Initially in cold water, the mixture clumps up if not shaken well, but it eventually disolves completely.  The flavors complement each other well, the sweetness of blackberry tempered by the tartness of pomegranate.  Lipton's product is much more flavorful than some of the Crystal Light varieties I have tried.  I would definitely buy this product and try some of the other flavors."
"I was worried that the sugar and carb content in these drink packets might be high because of the honey used to sweeten them. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. There is 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and each packet (2 servings) contains 120mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />My first impression of this drink mix was something along the lines of ""ohh my..."" followed by a second quick drink. This stuff is WAY better than I thought it would be. I think I would actually prefer the taste of the Lipton Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate to fresh brewed Blackberry pomegranate tea with honey. It is incredible! The honey sweetens it perfectly without giving it that over-sweet, bitter taste. The tea itself tastes more like a black tea than a green tea (which is a good thing in my book because black tea tastes better, but green tea seems to have more health benefits). It has a perfect harmonious balance between the blackberry, pomegranate and honey. They seem to compliment each other very well.<br /><br />This was my first time trying any of the Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I am tempted to run out (in pajamas and all) and snatch the rest of them off of the grocery shelf because I have a new favorite. Thanks Vine for bringing these into my life. I definitely recommend you try this....NOW.<br /><br />Note: all tastes buds are different and mine do tend to prefer super sweet drinks, so these may be too sweet for you if you like light sweetening. However, you can always add more water to your cup! I think you should try them and decide for yourself"
"I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. Expecting good taste since it is produced by Lipton, a favorite of mine and my wife's, this was hardly a gamble in trying. The flavor was excellent, strong, fruity, and actually better than expected. I've tried lots of flavored teas and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton.<br /><br />Fat & Sodium are 0. Sugar only 1g per 8 oz. and calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me. After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. WOW. Even better. Now the Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate flavor was still there, less sweet, the drink had the fizz of soda, calories cut to 2 ½, and sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and ""Bob's your Uncle""."
"Love the flavor of mango pineapple with a hint of green tea! Super refreshing to drink on a nice hot or warm day and I especially enjoyed it after a walk around the park. Quenched my thirst and didn't leave any disgusting after taste in my mouth that some other mix ins can leave. Super easy to mix into my drink: I just opened the packet, poured it into my cup, added cold water, and stirred. I had to stir for awhile to break everything up all the way otherwise I can see myself drinking little undissolved particles.<br /><br />What was so interesting about the flavor for me was how refreshing it was to drink and so flavorful. Right away you can taste the mango and pineapple, which are a perfect combination together, but there is also a hint of green tea behind those flavors. Thrown throughout the whole blend is a slight taste of honey that just compliments everything together. If your a fan of these flavors and are looking for a really refreshing drink, I have to say give Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea & Honey, Mango Pineapple a try for I am sure you will find it just as delightful and refreshing as I did.<br /><br />Please note that this is 5 calories per a serving, but keep in mind that 1 packet contains 2 servings so in fact it is 10 calories per a serving that I have been using. But I have also been using it in a really tall glass that holds more then 8oz of water (More like 13ishoz) hence both servings work just perfect for my taste level. Enjoy!"
"I think this product is absolutely great. I just gulped down 16 ounces of water flavored with one of these Lipton Tea&Honey packets and I really loved it!<br /><br />But, then again, mango is one of my favorite flavors. Pineapple is in there, too, but I think the mango stands out. Either way, it tastes delicious.<br /><br />You just empty one of the long, narrow packets into 16.9-ounces of water -- either a bottle (and shake well) or a glass (and stir well). I used a glass of water, but will try it in a bottle of water on my next long, hot walk.<br /><br />Packets are scored, so they're easy to open -- a real plus -- and easy to pour into either a bottle or a glass.<br /><br />Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors. Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, maltodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, beta carotene (for color). (NO aspartame.)<br /><br />Calories 5. Zero Fat. Zero Sodium. Sugars 1g. Vitamin A 10%. 10mg caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet).<br /><br />Lipton, you've got a winner here! Great product!<br /><br />UPDATE: The day after writing this review, I filled up a 33.8 ounce bottle with water, poured in ONE packet of ""To Go Stix"" and took it on a 6-hour road trip. Flavor and sweetness held up well in twice the amount of recommended liquid and the drive didn't seem nearly as long as usual."
This new honey pineapple mango is awful.  The worst tasting powdered tea mix I have ever had.  I guess I will have to go back to plain iced tea because I threw this stuff out.  I loved the Green Tea TO GO mandarin and mango but it has been discontinued by Lipton and replaced with this terrible tasting stuff.  I won't even waste my money trying the other new flavors.
"Normally I just don't like powdered drink mixes but these are really good! The package says that half a packet is for 16 ounces of water and has two servings per packet.<br /><br />I used them in 32oz of water the first time however, it was sweet enough that I cut back to a little more than half a packet for 32oz and it still had a nice sweetness.<br /><br />It's a great product and I would purchase it without any reservation."
"This is my second go-round with one of these and won't be my last.  Blackberry/Pomegranate is a fantastic combo and using Sucralose instead of Aspartame (which metabolizes into formaldehyde) makes it that much better! Some might find it a little too sweet, but I liked it fine.  And being a Type II Diabetic I'm very happy to have something that I can enjoy pretty much whenever I want and won't throw my diet out of whack.  Nice job, Lipton."
"There is very little tea taste, you can taste a fruity flavor and a little honey BUT it does contain sucralose which is NOT natural. I would think this is false advertising if you claim a product is all natural and has ingredients that are not natural??? It is overly sweet and really doesn't taste natural to me.<br />so this is a Warning that this product contains sucralose (splenda)<br />I had thought it would only be sweetened with honey because that is the only sweetener mentioned in the description."
"We tried this recently. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I am allergic to aspartame, so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there are<br />already off my radar.  After living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years, I developed<br />a soda habit that I am trying to break. I've tried plain tea, don't care much for it, so looked for<br />a decent flavored tea that I didn't have to boil water for (partially disabled, and no stove, etc<br />where I am most of the time).<br /><br />Last time at the store, I saw these. The package is a little deceptive, so be aware!<br />That ""five calories"" is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for HALF of a bottle of water<br />with ONE packet mixed in! I guess they didn't want to post double-digits of a whopping ten calories,<br />but that's what it is for one packet.<br /><br />The sweeteners are THREE KINDS - Honey, Sugar AND Sucralose. Why they needed three, I do not know.<br />It actually ends up being a little too sweet. I make it, them dilute it with more water than<br />it technically needs.<br /><br />Not sure why Lipton can't just make something ALL natural, or use stevia, which has no effect on<br />blood glucose. They seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason, but I don't know why. They have no<br />problems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners, but avoid stevia!  Weird...<br /><br />I have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week, but I have been sick. I am not sure<br />if it is related to the illness, or because I've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the last<br />few days. Aspartame makes my mouth, tongue and throat swell up, which is why I read every label now.<br />Not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - I would tend to think not, because my lips are not<br />numb nor is my tongue swollen. Still, I'd avoid the sucralose if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is really sweet, but I like it. It is refreshing and tasty. Again, a little too sweet for my<br />personal tastes, so I ""water"" it down with lots of ice, and it makes it very good!<br />It's worth trying. This is the only flavor we've tried so far, but will definitely give the others a shot<br />as well. If it helps me give up soda, then that's even better! : )<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 9, 2012:<br /><br />Well, it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest, with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records.<br />Of course, I was drinking a lot of tea. These packets are 10 calories each (that ""5 calories"" on the box refers to HALF<br />of one packet!), and I had either one or two packets each day for the last month, perhaps.<br />We also tried the peach flavor now, and I don't care for it, but my husband and son like it better than this one.<br /><br />I had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd. Now, I am hypoglycemic, so maybe that is part of it,<br />but I have to mention it in case others have this problem. I got this tea originally to help me get away from my Pepsi habit.<br />The 24-oz bottles of Pepsi that I buy have 300 calories in the bottle. I make the tea kind of weak, so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - I like the flavor better that way (just personal preference), so by comparison, I am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz, vs the 300 in the 24-oz Pepsi. Savings of about 97% of the calories, which should be a good thing!<br /><br />Here's the kicker - I have been GAINING WEIGHT since I changed over to the tea! Nothing else has changed. I didn't suddenly<br />take up eating endlessly, etc, and in fact, have eaten a little less during this heat wave. I put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea. Now, from a caloric standpoint, it doesn't seem possible. However, I am one of those people who does much better on high-protein, low-carb. If you have a similar type of metabolism/body, then be aware of these little packets!  I think it might be the honey in them creating a non-stop (because I sip tea all day long to keep cool) assault on my blood sugars. I've noticed that I feel hungry more often as well too. I normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while. With this tea, it almost gives you the munchies. I haven't indulged, so it isn't from extra food. It has to be the tea.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that I don't think that everyone will experience this effect, but wanted to bring it up.<br />I think the combo of the THREE sugars Lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally.<br />I still like the tea, but have now been cutting it down even more, to see if I can lessen the effects of the sweeteners.<br />I find it odd to think that I could cut out 590 calories a day (I usually drank two of those 24-oz pepsis! Yes, I was bad...) and GAIN weight. It has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system.<br /><br />So, if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low-carb diet, be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress, or even cause you to gain weight. I have also warned my husband, who tends towards higher blood glucose, to only drink it with meals, never alone like I do.  Just an important heads-up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long, long time.<br /><br />Lipton - please try making something with stevia, which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories. Why put sucralose into your items, when stevia is so much better?  I don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use! And I'd pay more for an item that used stevia... what a shame!"
"My coworkers and I all love this instant tea.  It has 10 calories per packet (2 servings per packet at 5 calories each, but really, one packet goes with 16 oz of water).  It is a little too sweet when you first taste it, but after a couple of sips, we adapted and loved it!  I'll be getting more of this!"
"I am mostly a water drinker, but occasionally I like to have a little flavor for my drink. The instant Lipton Tea mix provides that for just ten calories (five cal/8 oz.). It does have Sucralose in it, but it is pretty far down on the list of ingredients. I'm glad it has a little sugar, which leaves a much better after-taste than some other instant teas.<br /><br />This one (they have some other flavors) is Decaf Green Tea with Strawberry and Acai. You can put it in a bottled water, or at home I use one packet and fill-up a large glass. It comes with 10 packets, which works for me for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />The box boasts that it is sweetened with some honey and made from real tea leaves.<br /><br />For me, what made it a winner was that it didn't have a nasty after taste."
"This is a great convenience and great tasting product. I can find it in small quantities on the shelf at Walmart and other grocers but, not in higher quantities. The price point per box is less than 2.00 in most grocers but, do the math from the various merchants as I have found it frequently over 2.50 a box."
"Update:after a week or so of drinking this, I decided to stop because I was having some odd health problems (upset stomach, etc) and a lot more sinus/allergy problems than normal.  I decided that it might be the Acai berries, that were causing the problem.  I looked on the internet and the berries are associated with some stomach problems.  I really did like it, especially diluted somewhat, but it's not worth the aggravation.  If you don't think allergies will be a problem, here's what I thought of the product:<br /><br />I decided to try this flavor additive for bottles of water because it is decaf and also, unlike most of those flavor-adds, it does not use Equal or some other sweetener.  I can't drink much caffeine at one time (more than a couple of sips can really mess me up) and I also can't use Equal or several other of the sweeteners.  This tea uses honey and the natural sweetness of the strawberries and the Acai berries to sweeten the green tea that is the basis of the beverage and it doesn't contain caffeine.  It mixed very easily with the water and had a nice taste.  I don't like my bottled water to have very much flavor, so I tried changing the ratio (it was one packet to each 16.9 bottle) to see how using half strength would work and I liked that even better.  I ended up just putting the bottle of water with the flavor in it inside my fridge door and I just get a glass of water from a plain bottle and then add however much of the flavor that I want.  My boss liked the flavor, too, when I gave him a glass full.  I wasn't sure how to tell the Acai berries from the green tea, but I could definitely taste the strawberry, so if you don't like strawberries, you probably need to skip this product.  But if you love them, maybe you've found this year's summer drink."
"Be careful when opening the little packets because the powder is quite strong smelling.  I guess that comes with the powerful flavor this packs.  Also, as the granules take a while to dissolve I would suggest putting it in a container with a lid on it so you can vigorously shake the contents before pouring into an ice-filled glass (crushed ice is my favorite).  Then, you can enjoy this robust blend of strawberry, honey, and acai berries.  Lipton gets five stars from me."
"I previously got the blackberry and pomegranate flavor off of a Vine newsletter.  I really enjoyed it so I decided to give this flavor a try as well.<br /><br />It's about the same.  Really if you're not a tea drinker this tastes a lot more like Kool-Aid or Crystal Light than tea. The sweetness from the honey and fruit disguises most of the tea flavor from it.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it, though probably not enough to buy it instead of my regular tea mix, which I'm sure is much cheaper.<br /><br />That is all."
"I'm really liking these new Lipton packets. I've also tries their pineapple mango and its just as great. What I like about them is that they are great for traveling. When I go away, I usually buy a case of spring water and add one of these packets to the water. I'm not a big fan of just plain water especially on the beach so having this flavor makes the water delicious. They are very convenient to put in your pocket too. I always have one handy when going out to eat because I don't drink soda so i'll ask for a tall glass of ice water and add a pack of the Lipton to it. You get 10 packets in a box which is nice too. And lastly its decaf Green Tea with Honey so you get some antioxidants. I've tried many other brands and so many seem to have an after taste that tastes like chemicals. I'm happy to find that these didn't have that. They also have a peach flavor and a blueberry, haven't seen them in the stores yet but i'm sure by the summer they will hit the shelves.<br /><br />Its a great sugar free flavoring and enjoy them better than many others."
"Like the other varieties available, these come in individual packets for use with bottled water which makes them really handy. This particular flavor of Blackberry Pomegranate is more intense than some of the others. Not a bad thing if you like both of the flavorings. Worth atry if you're a flavored sweet tea fan."
"A powdered tea mix that's individually packed for use in bottled water, which makes it handy for on the go. The flavor is good if you like sweetened tea."
"These one serving packets are becoming increasingly popular for people on the go and for those of us who like to take something other than water when heading to the gym, but dislike the chemical taste of many drink supplements. This product really fits the bill for something that's tasty ( without any wierd aftertaste) and somewhat healthy. Also for those who have wanted the benefits of green tea without the slight tartness of the tea itself, the strawberry acai taste is just exotic enough to make you forget you're drinking green tea. I liked it!"
"These tea mixes are fantastic for work since they dissolve quickly and require no stirring IF you add them to your glass first.  Stirring or shaking is definitely ideal, but the beverage works without them.  Not too sweet and no bitterness that green tea mixes can sometimes have.  I didn't find that there was a pronounced tea flavor here, but enjoyed the light sweetness this mix added to a glass of cold water.  Oh, and I'd highly recommend adding ice AFTER mixing since ice seems to keep the powder from dissolving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice and relatively low-calorie way to dress up water without a lot of artificial sweeteners."
"I wasn't prepared to enjoy this tea mix as much as I did. The Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea with Honey (Mango Pineapple) was absolutely delicious. So much so, that I went out and bought two other flavors to try and mango pineapple is still my favorite. This is the perfect flavoring to jazz up a bottle of water and much better than some that tastes like koolaid. Two thumbs up."
"I've drunk my share of powdered drinks, including stuff from Propel, Lipton, Crystal Light, even the Walmart brands, as well as the liquid concentrates, like the Mio.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this packet is that it's a bit bigger than the normal Lipton Iced Teas.  Well, it definitely made a difference in flavor.  Put this into a 20 ounce glass (it's designed for 16.9 ounce), and it was still full flavor.  Strangely enough, it's supposed to be Mango Pineapple, but the flavor seems more like Peach to me.<br /><br />Still, the flavor was very nice, again, slightly stronger flavor than the Lipton To Go packets I usually use (my favorite is the Lipton Iced Green Tea, Mandarin and Mango flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HQAYLA"">Lipton Tea to Go Iced Green Tea Mix Packs, Mandarin & Mango, 10 ct</a>).<br /><br />Overall, very nice for me.  Definitely best with Ice."
"Great taste. Each package is enough for two cups of water, more or less depending on how concentrated you want your drink to be. Therefore, there are enough powder for 20 cups, which I think is pretty good. Not too sweet and not too bland, but there is a distinct mango and pineapple tropical taste."
"This is not the first time I've used  Lipton Green tea to-go products, but Blackberry Pomegranate Green tea is a new flavor.  For the most part ,most of these are virtually the same, but I have to say that I have always a high taste for anything blackberry. I don't taste the pomegranate as much as I do the blackberry and that's a plus for me, but for those die hard POM drinkers it might not be so likable.<br />Would buy this product again? Absolutely. Especially since I SHOULD drink more water but won't unless its flavored. This give my water the boost I like and it only has five calories per serving.  I highly recommend it."
Delicious and refreshing with a fresh mango taste. I can't taste the pineapple at all which is too bad because I got this specifically for that. I'm not a big mango fan but this taste great. The green tea is just right. I plan on buying this on a regular basis.
"I'm picky about iced tea and haven't been a huge fan of Lipton in the past, nor am I very fond of powered drink mixes. I thought I'd give these a try since I'm on the go lately and don't have time to make proper iced tea. They are EXCELLENT. Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The other flavors are great too - my favorite being Blackberry Pomegranate. I'm so sick of the same ol' same ol' Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Orangade, Strawberry Kiwi, etc. These flavors sound a bit odd at first, but the taste is crazy good.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes. However, it clearly states this on the box and the extra effort is absolutely worth it."

Just sweet enough, but very fruity, almost like the tea with flavored syrup you get in restaurants. I'm addicted to these now and can't go back to the hum-drum Crystal Lite flavors. The Blackberry Pomegranate is the best, but I've also tried the Mango Pineapple and it's really good too.<br /><br />I should mention that the crystals are a little harder to break up in cold water than most single drink mixes. However, it clearly states this on the box and the extra effort is absolutely worth it."
"Delicious!  I love the Lipton To Go Stix and now I think the tea and honey, mango pineapple is my favorite.  It's so convenient to take of few of these with me at work or when I'm traveling.  And, I'm not ashamed to admit that I've even taken this into a restaurant with me, ordered a glass of water, and had a delicious tea with my meal for much less than I would pay for one of their drinks."
I like the taste.  It's sweet - but not too sweet.  No aftertaste.  It's pleasant to drink chilled or at room temperature.<br /><br />If you like a refreshing tea drink you should try this!<br /><br />The only annoyance is that it's hard to mix.  I suggest sipping a little water from the bottle before pouring in the mix.  That'll make it easier to agitate.
"and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.  Mixed well, no granulation, you really couldn't ask for anything more and Lipton like a good drug dealer knows what they are doing, give me a taste for free and have me for life.  5 stars."
"What an easy and refreshing drink!  I did it in my glass, but it was a yummy change to the normal water that I drink.  Love that it is made with honey, and the strawberry acai blend was delish!"
This drink mix was a refreshing treat.  It was just tart enough and just sweet enough to provide a nice fruity drink.  I completely forgot that this was a green tea mix.  It reminded me of a light cranberry-apple flavor.  I'll definitely buy this one again and again.<br /><br />Loved it!
"This is a tasty product from Lipton.  I am not a big green tea fan, but I enjoyed this product.  It is easy to use.  It dissolved quickly and cleanly with no lumps or clumping.  It is favorful without being overpowering.  The mix of blackberry and pomegranate was intriguing but not too tart or sweet.  It is making me into a fan."
"The first thing I check with any flavored drink is the nutrition facts (I want to eat my carbs and calories, not drink them!) There are 2gm sugar, 10 calories and 2gm of carbs per packet (it is listed as 1/2 packet per serving, but that is unrealistic). One packet makes about 16oz prepared. Each box comes with 10 packets. The packets are made with real tea leaves and sweetened with honey. This mix does not contain Aspartame, it is sweetened with honey and Sucralose (equivalent of Splenda). The Strawberry Acai flavor is decaffeinated.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List: Honey Granules (Sugar, Honey), Malic Acid (Provides Tartness), Decaffeinated Green Tea Powder, Hibiscus Extract, Maltodextrin (Corn), Sucralose (Sweetener), Natural Flavor, Strawberry Juice Solids, Acai Juice Solids<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it has a really nice and sweet Strawberry flavor with a hint of honey. I personally can't taste the Acai. I also verily taste the tea. It is more of a strawberry drink with a slight tea and honey flavor. It is really good. However, if you are expecting lightly flavored tea, this one is not for you. It is also on the sweet side. I personally prefer sweet drinks and it is perfect for me. If you prefer your drinks not as sweet, plan on adding more water.<br /><br />I definitely like this flavor and will buy more. I do wish it had caffeine, but I can stick to this in the evening hours. It makes a nice alternative to water. While I would recommend this, I like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I7Z0T4"">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate, 10-Count (Pack of 12)</a> flavor better (it is caffeinated). These would also be great with vodka or rum."
"I'm not crazy about most of the bottled flavors of diet green tea. Most of them have an artificial-icky flavor. You can really taste the honey-kissed flavor in this mix in variety. I can honestly say it's my new favorite diet green tea (sorry, Snapple, you've been trumped.). Yummy!"
"Lipton's new packets of Iced Green Tea with Honey and Blackberry Pomegranate are delicious, refreshing, and light-tasting.  Plus, they're only 5 calories per packet.  Obviously, they're very similar to (and probably a direct competition for) Crystal Light's to-go packets.  Naturally, Lipton offers tea flavors.<br /><br />The instructions say to add one full packet to 16 oz. of water, but I used twice the water it recommended for one packet, and it's still very flavorable and super-sweet.  If you're going to use a glass of water or small bottle of water, I'd recommend trying only half a packet (or less) to start.  There are honey granules (sugar and honey) that dissolve and sweeten the water.  The packaging touts that there's no aspartame (Equal) in these like Crystal Light, but there is sucralose listed as an ingredient, which is another artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, is that these new Lipton packets, like Crystal Light packets, give your water a little boost of flavor and, in the case of green tea, flavonoids.  If you're trying to eliminate sodas from your diet and are tired of drinking ""just"" water, try these little packets.  You'll still be drinking the water, but you'll have a flavor boost that won't make you feel like you're drinking ""just"" water."
"I normally drink decaf beverages so I jumped at the chance to review this.  It's hard to find a powder that tastes good AND is decaf.<br /><br />I find these types of products very artifical tasting and I really don't enjoy them.  They actually make me more thirsy.  This one is very nice.  There is a very strong taste of honey, which I love.  The strawberry and acai taste is mild and not overwhelming.  If you like the taste of honey, you will like this.  If you don't like honey, then this product probably is not for you.<br /><br />I will buy these again.  I  didn't feel thirsty after drinking it and it didn't have a horrible aftertaste, as some of these products do.<br /><br />Great product."
"The instructions state to add one packet to 8oz of water. Since my bottled water is 20oz, I removed enough water to fit the powder, and mixed it in. It tasted a little weak, but was fine.  I then added a 2nd packet. Wow - it was very sweet.  This is great tasting and pretty concentrated - one packed will flavor a 20oz bottle just fine. Definite thumbs-up!"
"""To Go"" products have been one of my favorite items since I began using bottled water. On a break at work, while biking or hiking, or on a trip - slipping some To Go dust into my bottled water always provided a tasty break. To Go drinks also provide a nice flavor break when travelling aboard in countries where the water is not safe and all you want to drink is bottled water.<br /><br />And I do enjoy Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Team Mix, Team and Mango Pineapple product. The mango and pineapple tastes dominated enough that I really could not taste the green tea but that didn't matter that much. I enjoyed the health benefits of green tea without the taste.<br /><br />The product has 5 calories per 8 ounce serving as it relies on honey for sweetening and real fruit flavors. And  do appreciate that the product does not have aspartame, the artificial sweetening chemical once sold under the brand name NutraSweet that may or may not be harmful, depending upon whom you listen to. But why take chances?<br /><br />I enjoy most of Lipton's To Go drinks but especially liked the mango, pineapple taste."
"All my life I've confounded my British mother by my intense dislike of tea.  It's something she can't understand and certainly hasn't accepted even after all these years.  Since I've been hearing and reading about the benefits of tea, especially green tea, I decided to give this product a try in the hopes that it would help me overcome my antipathy.<br /><br />My plan seems to be working.  Lipton has mixed its green tea with honey, mango and pineapple, a mixture which is more than just palatable but actually delicious.  It has no hint of the ""medicine"" taste which I've always associated with tea and serving it iced on a warm day is so refreshing.  The stix are convenient either for home use or for traveling so it can be enjoyed wherever you go.  I definitely intend to include this tea in my summer beverage consumption."
"Lipton To Go makes all sorts of powdered flavors, but this one is especially good.  This decaf Iced Green Tea mix with Honey and Stawberry Acai is flavorful without being overpowering.  It's sweet without the calories or the obnoxious taste of sugarless sweeteners.  The pouches are for mixing with 16 ounces of water, so they're easy to use and easy to carry in a lunchbag.  It's a great drink."
"This has a nice pleasant taste.  The artificial sweetness doesn't seem artificial to me, and it's not overpowering.  The strawberry flavor stands out for me (and to be honest, I really don't know what Acai really tastes like, so maybe it's there and I just don't notice it).<br /><br />But as much as I like it, I am unlikely to buy it again in its current packaging.  I guess I'm just not a fan of making a bottle at a time.  If this came in a form where I could make a pitcher at a time, it would likely replace the gallon container of Crystal Light that is always on hand in my refrigerator."
"This is a very refreshing & delicious tea blend. I got this when it was in the mid 80's out and made it with ice and sat on my front porch sipping this in the evening after dinner, and it was absolutely delightful. It is energizing and soothing and loaded with flavor. I like the honey and strawberry flavors. This is my first taste of green tea and I am hooked! I highly recommend this. It's so easy to make and tastes awesome!"
"I often buy products like this to use when traveling, because it is cheaper to buy a case of water and use a drink mix than to buy sodas and drinks on the road.  This tasted like fresh-brewed tea and disolved completely.  I wasn't stuck with a residue on the bottom.  Just the right sweetness level and a tasty mix of strawberry flavor."
"When I drink this delicious green tea flavored with mango and pineapple I like to imagine I'm at a beach. In fact if I was going on vacation I'd take these packets of iced tea mix with me. One packet works well in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water but it tastes even better stirred into a glass of water with ice. The message you get when you read the front of the box is that this is going to be all natural with just honey sweetening your tea. That is not exactly true. This contains honey granules (made from honey and sugar), sucralose and maltodextrin. This also contains green tea powder, hibiscus extract and natural flavor (mango and pineapple). If you made this tea with only 8 ounces of water as it suggests then this tea would be very sweet. It needs about double that amount of water to taste normal. So really if you add this to a normal bottle of water it will still be only five calories per drink. I also like that this does not have aspartame in it. The flavor is great and if you don't mind a little sugar this might be a satisfying drink for the summer.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
"I just love this drink.  It's instant, only requires a little extra stirring to mix completely into the water, so shake or stir well or granules will stay on the bottom.<br /> I don't do well with caffeine and this has none in it.  Green tea, Acai and honey, all good ingredients.  On top of that it's low in calories.  Only five per packet.  The strawberry goes well with the Acai.  Just a really refreshing drink. I can drink this totally guilt free."
"Almost every add-in powder or liquid flavoring that I've tried has had a pretty bad aftertaste. With this Lipton To Go Stix I didn't experience an aftertaste at all. The honey, mango and pineapple flavors were all very subtle but mixed well together. I highly recommend this product for anyone who enjoys flavored tea."
"What a great product - it's low-calorie, it's decaffeinated, it's a source of antioxidants and it tastes delicious. It's also convenient to pour this mix into a water bottle and shake it up. I don't see how Lipton could possibly improve on this."
The flavor is a tangy strawberry; it is sweet but not too strong.  I like that there is a decaf version such as this.  It mixes well in a pitcher or glass with little effort.  I'm very glad I had the opportunity to taste-test this drink.
"Lipton is well known for their tea products, so I didn't hesitate to try this, despite the fact that customarily I do not drink products with artifical sweeteners.  I recently started a ""reduction in caloric intake,"" my phrase for that dreaded word, DIET.  I have a bottle of this every morning and it tides me over until lunchtime.  It's a bit sweet, actually, and I use more water than it calls for, and it's perfect.  Refreshing and delicious!  I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves tea with fruity tastes.  It's a perfect blend of flavor."
"These to go packs are very very good, I have found for my own taste that 1 packet works for me in 24oz of water or more. 16oz is way to sweet for me. It takes a while to mix in well so shake well and shake as drinking. hard to add to glass and stir to get all mixed in."
"I am not a fan of overly sweet drinks, but I'm always on the lookout for an interesting new drink.  I loved this Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate Tea Mix.  It is a refreshing, crisp taste that I will go back to again and again.  I offered this treat to several family members and friends, who all were very enthusiatic about this product.  I will be buying this in the market!"
"This is the third flavor I tried of Lipton's Tea & Honey instant flavored drink mixes and was still not disappointed. I used a full packet with a 16oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Mango & Pineapple Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.  The packets are very convenient too carry with you and too use anywhere you can get a glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning. The box list that these are 5 calories per serving, which is eight ounces. But each packet is designed too be used with 16 ounces so is 10 calories. So for two servings (which is what I drink) you are consuming a drink with 20 mg of caffeine, 0g Fat, 0g Sodium, 0g Protein, and 2g each of Sugar and Carbohydrates. Plus this flavor claims too supply 10% of your daily Vitamin A per serving."
"Having tried and liked a different flavor I decided too try another of these instant flavored drink mixes and was not disappointed. I took a packet out of the box and added it too 16oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. When I took my first sip I was shocked. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Strawberry & Acai Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning.

The packets are very convenient too carry with you and too use anywhere you can get a glass or bottle of water."
"I was surprised by how much I like this tea. First, the taste is great. The sweet stawberry flavor is very intense. I can't say I really taste the acai, but I do taste the honey. The convenience of either adding it to a glass of cold water or to a bottle of water for on-the-go is nice. I prefer decaf teas during the day so this is perfect. With only 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it's a much better option than sodas or high calorie fruit juices. I will definitely get this again."
"I drink mostly water every day, so was looking for something to change it up that had some flavor but that was also decaf.  These little tubes of Lipton to-go stix decaf iced green tea mix are convenient, and tasty.  The taste is a little to sweet for me so I use a half a tube per bottle of water or add ice cubes to help dilute it in a glass.  This is very tasty, not grainy at all as long as you shake or stir it well.  It is a great way to stay hydrated and mix up the taste of bland water when you are sick of it.  I would recommend these for any busy person, to throw in your bag for a flavorful drink anytime and anywhere. I will buy these again and am looking forward to trying their other flavors."
"I really liked the flavor of this, the tartness, as well as the sweetness. It is not too sweet but has just the right balance.  The instructions call for 16.9 ounces of water, but I put it in about 22 ounces (which is what I usually do with powdered mixes that call for less water). This has a little honey, sugar, as well as sucralose (splenda)in it. That's why it's only 5 calories per packet. I would definitely buy this in the future."
"Enjoy Lipton Tea? If so you have to try this new flavor. Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate has to be one of the best flavors that I've tasted. It disolves nicely and is the perfect blend. Those hot days are coming soon. Instead of drinking pop that makes you more thirsty, take a Lipton to go packet that will quench thisrt, and leave you fully satisfied."
"I've had this flavor and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007I7YYGY"">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple, 10-Count (Pack of 12)</a> and they're both very delicious, let alone incredibly easy to prepare. Pour the powder in water (the instructions say 16oz but I feel that with 24oz it's a little less tart), shake it and there you have it, instant iced tea. Very good stuff and I look forward to trying the other flavors as well."
This is a great-tasting refreshing drink.  I love the tropical flavors. It is convenient because you can carry the little packets with you and mix into an 8 oz. bottle of water and have an instant drink. These are great to take along when you are going to be on the run all day. There are 10 in a package.
"yummy, this tastes really good, not too sweet and plenty of fruity flavor. It reminds me a lot of the taste you get from Crystal Lights brand Raspberry Ice flavor. I made it with hot water from my tea pot, then after it got room temperature I put it in the fridge. I have to say it tasted good hot too. If you add 2 quarts of water to your pitcher and then add 4 of these little packets you'll have 2 quarts ready to drink instead of using just one little packet with 16 ounces of water. You'd need ice to add too that way to make it cold enough so I'll just make it my way, 2 quarts at a time... You can always fill your empty water bottle with it before you go where ever your going and you can save the big bucks and use your home drinking water instead of paying to buy water in a bottle."
"These are pretty cool!  You can pour them into a water bottle and mix or just a large glass (add the ice later or it's hard to blend).  The thing that surprises me is that they are 5 calories...which is really good.  Because unlike some low-calorie drinks, this has NO aspartame.  So no icky aftertaste and no scary chemical either.  Just a good mildly-sweet tea blend (not over the top cloyingly sweet).  I was surprised because I usually hate flavored teas, and just opt for unsweetened black or green tea.<br />This is refreshing and light, and I like that's it green tea because green tea is supposed to be healthy for you...I just better not drink this with an order of fries, LOL.<br />I'm putting a few of these in my purse for when cold water doesn't do the trick.  Will definitely purchase, but wish they came in a larger box..."
"I'm a big fan of the Lipton To Go products, I drink a lot of their White Tea W/ Raspberry because it's wonderful but Caffeine limits my drinking to the mornings and early afternoons, Then I found out about the Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai and I had to try it!<br /><br />It's a true taste treat and the sugars are very low (1g per serving) So I don't have to worry because of my dietary limitations of sugar.<br /><br />I have a iSi soda siphon, that I've been using for years and after putting a  packet of this Iced Tea mix in the bottom of my glass, I spray some of my carbonated seltzer water into the glass making the most delicious Green Tea soda I have ever tasted, I LOVE IT!<br /><br />This mix is truly delicious and it's decaf, I will be enjoying this as I watch my evening TV without losing sleep."
"All you need is a regular bottle of spring water or whatever you want to use, in goes the powder and voila, instant iced tea drink (well, instant in that you have to shake it first). The flavor (mango pineapple in this case) is very tasty and refreshing. Powdered drink mixes in this form aren't exactly a new found invention but if it tastes as good as this does, I have no problems recommending it to anyone. It's perfect for storing in your desk at work, taking it on the go or in just about any manner you can think of."
"I was not expecting much with all the instant flavored drink mixes out there. There are ten packets in each box. I added one too 20oz bottle of cold water. It dissolved quite well with some vigorous shaking. When I took my first sip I was shocked. This tasted very good and as advertised. The water had become a refreshing and tasty Blackberry & Pomegranate Green Iced Tea sweeten with honey.<br /><br />I wanted this for flavor and did not care about calories but for those who do one warning.

I enjoyed the taste so much I have ordered two more flavors."
"Don't ya just love the little ""to-go"" packs of flavoring available today for adding flavor to bottles of water? Find a flavor you really like, and the packs slip into your purse. You can ALWAYS find a bottle of water wherever you are at today! Simply add the flavoring to your water, and shake!<br /><br />Lipton Tea & Honey is no exception.<br /><br />Simply grab your bottle of water and a flavor pack... this one was Mango Pineapple flavored Iced Green Tea, pour it into the water.... and shake!<br /><br />A delicious, refreshing tea with just a hint of mango and pineapple. Lightly sweetened, but not overpowering. A low 5-calories per 8-ounce serving, or 10-calories per 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />This is going to be one of my all time favorites, and I can see me reaching for this one often when the weather heats up this summer! Simply refreshing!<br /><br />I give Lipton Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea Mango Pineapple Five Stars and my Thumbs Up!<br /><br />****DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review."
"I was surprised at how good this tasted.  It's sweet and you can really taste the pineapple.  It also has only 10 calories per 16oz serving (better than soda) and it mixes well in water.  The tea also doesn't have that strong instant tea after taste.<br /><br />I would definately, buy this again."
"This product was added to a small bottle of water and it was very refreshing.  You could really taste the Mango.  Nice flavor, and it mixed very well.  No grit.  I recommend this product for quick on-the-go travels."
"this low-cal decaf iced green tea mix has a good strawberry flavor<br /><br />upon the first taste, this drink doesn't seem too sweet - but about a minute after the first sip, i could also definitely taste the honey!<br /><br />but how can something that tastes good with a great subtle aftertaste only have 5 calories???<br /><br />i don't drink diet soda or other carbonated drinks so i'm always on the lookout for something that can not only slake my thirst, but also offer something a bit on the sweet side<br /><br />w/actual honey, strawberry juice, and acai (berry from a species of palm), this drink is a winner - good stuff!"
Well to start with I am not a fan of just plain tea but I do like fruit teas. This tea is sweetened with honey and I love the blackberry pomegranate flavor. I see on the box it does not have aspartame so it is very healthy. This could get me to stop drinking so much diet cola.  I truly love the flavor and will be ordering this from Amazon. As I said DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!
"Not a big fan of this type of drink (mixes for water) but thought I would give it a try. I thought that it was really sweet, luckily I had a bigger water bottle than the directions said because I don't think I would have been able to drink it based on the directions. I could definitly taste and smell the fake sugar that is in it (Sucralose) so I was a little confused when it said that it was sweetend with honey. I would not buy this product again."
"My husband and children, for some reason or other, HATE the taste of regular water so I'm always looking for a way to make the water taste different. We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUHG"">MIO Strawberry Watermelon, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again."
"10 individual pouches come in this box, which is handy for sticking it in your purse or in your lunchbox. It is easy to mix up with a glass of water, and does not take long to dissolve.<br /><br />Why only 3 stars? Well, first because it really does not taste like tea, more like berry kool-aid. The second reason is that though the words ""tea & honey"" are splashed all over the product box and the packet, you'd expect that 1) it tastes a little like tea, 2) you could taste the honey, 3) honey is the only sweetener.  I've already talked about it failing point 1. You can faintly taste the honey - it's not overpowering, and was a nice taste. Point 2 in its favor. Now onto point 3; the ingredients are as follows: honey granules (sugar, honey), citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetener), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids. I see 3 sweeteners other than the honey granules: sucralose, maltodextrin, and isomalt. Point 3 against this product. Serving size is also misleading - you'd think one packet is one serving. Wrong, one packet is 2 servings. Not really a big deal, but it might be for some.<br /><br />I'll enjoy the drink, but not sure that I would be eager to go out and purchase it right away."
"I have been a big fan and consumer of the Lipton to Go mix for a long time. Why mess with a good thing? I loved the old flavors, Citrus and Apple Cranberry were the best! Lipton has done away with them for this new line of horrible tasting drink mixes!! I bought this flavor and it is awful!! I can't even describe to you what it tastes like, it is very bad . Nothing like strawberry....I can't stand it! LIPTON....BRING BACK THE OLD FLAVORS!!! I won't be buying this crap!"
"This is false advertising at its worse. This taste like a chemically infused berry sugar drink made not with real sugar, but with sucralose (diet sugar).  Left a metallic tinge in my mouth."
"I can't write a review of this product because I cannot use it.<br /><br />I got it thinking it was a natural alternative to the mixes with aspartame or high fructose corn syrup...but no. This product (as a couple other reviewers have stated) has sucralose in it. If I drink or eat products with sucralose in them, I get migraines. So I can't even taste it to tell you how it tastes.<br /><br />When a product description says ""naturally sweetened with honey"" And the second ingredient IS honey, WHY why why why throw in an artificial sweetner? That's like adding peach flavour to a slice of peach. Why make something that IS healthy, unhealthy and more expensive to produce by adding unnecessary ingredients?<br /><br />Depending on how you feel about Stevia, try the True Orange/True Lemon products...or enjoy your plain water :-) That's the way I'm going to go."
"I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix. She likes the mild strawberry flavor.<br /><br />But it is not as natural as Lipton advertises. Lipton's product info states, ""Lipton Tea & Honey ... is a low calorie iced tea mix you can feel good about simply because it's made with real ingredients ... blended with honey and strawberry and acai flavors ... Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors ... flavor with other natural flavor ... and no aspartame.""<br /><br />So what's there to not like about that? Well it's not all real ingredients and sweetened with just honey. The fine print discloses that it includes Sucralose (sweetener). Shane Ellison calls himself ""The People's Chemist"" and is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402225059"">Over the Counter Natural Cures: Take Charge of Your Health in 30 Days with 10 Lifesaving Supplements for under $10</a>. Shane was a big pharma chemist who quit when he discovered that the drugs that he was creating for the big pharma companies were nothing more than toxins and the real cures were natural and didn't require a prescription. Shane says that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose (Splenda) have serious problems. Studies show that they lead to weight gain and even pre-diabetes. Artificial sweeteners ""disrupt the body's natural calorie counter"" and ""put the users at much higher risk for being obese and insulin resistant."" Shane says that Sucralose, 1,6-Dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-'-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-'-D-galactopyranoside, contains a historically deadly, nasty form of chlorine (RNFOC), which yields poisons such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides. ""An RNFOC can invade every nook and cranny of the body ... and may result in weakened immune function, irregular heartbeat, agitation, shortness of breath, skin rashes, headaches, liver and kidney damage, birth defects, and cancer. Hiding its origin, sucralose pushers assert that it is 'made from sugar'. Sucralose is as close to sugar as glass cleaner is to purified water. France recently banned such false advertising statements. The deceit has been ignored within the United States.""<br /><br />Why does the FDA allow this? Shane says science was sold out for profit. ""Just like chemists manipulate the properties of matter, Big Pharma manipulates studies using 'checkbook science.' This allows them to pay for the design and interpretation of clinical trials. Checkbook science isn't illegal by FDA standards. It's been going on for over 20 years. Known as the Bayh-Dole Act, US law was amended in 1980 to permit flagrant conflicts of interest, ones that allow the industry to design drug trials and hire experts to conjure up favorable results at will.""<br /><br />So if you want something natural, look for Shane Ellison's book and skip this Lipton's tea mix."
"After just two sips of this mix and I had to toss it out.  It was too sweet and left a bad taste in my mouth.  As well, there was more sweet cloying taste to me then tea.  I really cannot add much that other reviewers have not already stated.  This stuff is nasty and I do not recommend it to anyone."
So we gave this the old college try but it failed with my entire family. It has too many flavors going on and a bit of a after taste.  We use these type of mixes all the time but this one will stay until the next natural disaster. Not worth the money or ruining a bottle of water.
"These are convenient to carry in your purse or pocket, but I expected them to taste more like green tea and less like fruit juice.  I didn't care for them at all."
"All you can taste is artificial sweetener. It is inconceivable how they can describe this product as ""sweetened with honey.""  I can't taste any fruit either.  This stuff is horrid!"
"I bought this product because I dislike the taste of artificial sweeteners, so I thought this would taste better than other low-calorie powdered drink mixes such as Crystal Light.  However, as soon as I tasted it I knew there was ""fake sugar"" in it- I could taste the artificial sweetener but could not taste the honey at all.  I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.  A spoonful of sugar only has about 20 calories- if they put one spoonful per pack and each pack makes two glasses of beverage, it would still be a low-calorie drink, it would taste better and would be more natural."
Pros:<br />Easy Mix<br />10 Cals per Pack<br /><br />Cons:<br />Taste<br />Bitter & Fake<br />Does not taste like pineapple at all!<br /><br />I gave it a try on 3 different days and it just got worse and worse.. Yuck!
"This pertains ONLY to the Lipton To Go Stix (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007P5NVBI"">Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple, 10-Count (Pack of 4)</a>) product with the honey, mango and pineapple flavor. I had thought this would be a product I'd enjoy as mango and pineapple are two of my favorites when it comse to fresh fruit or smoothies; I've also been a Lipton tea customer for years, and have never been disappointed in their products. I even enjoy honey on occasion as a more natural sweetener, and was curious to see how these flavors would combine.<br /><br />This one was such a disappointment that I gave away what was left in my sampler box (my friends and family didn't care for it either). Now I liked the convenience of the stix, and have appreciated what companies have done in order to give you a somewhat cheaper form of ""flavored water"" so I thought Lipton might have had something.<br /><br />The honey was so prominent and overly sweet that it pretty much wrecked the remaining flavors; it also had a slight chemical tinge which left me with a horrible after-taste in the end. What there was of the mango and pineapple was not the fresh taste I had hoped for, but something with a disgusting artificiality that did not play up a combination which does work very well under most circumstances (such as when I've made up my own mixture); again there was way more artificial sweetness (and this is coming from a Southern girl who loves sweet iced tea on occasion). Even the fragrance was sickening and overpowering. The color in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water was a straw-yellow -- not quite golden, not quite regular yellow, but I figured that meant it would be strong enough to give me the full flavor I desired without being too weak. As I mentioned, I could only take several sips; I think I drank 1/3 of a bottle in the end...and then I called it quits. I even refrigerated it for a bit, as if hoping everything needed time to ""merge""; after a few hours I tried again -- lost cause and down the drain it went.<br /><br />I don't know if the other flavors are an improvement, but I will never waste money to find out. Had the box I received NOT have been a sampler courtesy of Lipton, I would have demanded a refund. Back to the drawing board Lipton!"
"Wow!  This stuff is full body shake GROSS!!!!  It has a very unnatural gross sweetness and I can't even find words to describe the disgusting mango pineapple flavor.  It sounded so good - two of my favorite flavors and I love tea, but I can't make myself drink another sip of this grossness.  Wish I hadn't been roped in by the lightning deal.  This is going in the trash.  Save your money."
"My teenagers love green tea and anything with a funky flavor, so I got them the mango pineapple flavor of this Lipton To Go green tea mix. It's a great way to flavor plain water, which one of my boys hates to drink.<br /><br />They both liked it quite a bit and said it tastes just like the pre-made Lipton green tea bottles you buy in the store. I mixed up half a packet in an 8-ounce glass of water for myself, and it took some time for it to fully dissolve. The color is a bit weird...a yellowy orange. I could taste the mango and the pineapple, but with the honey, it had a bit too much going on for me, flavor-wise. Didn't seem that balanced. I wouldn't make it again for myself, but I'd buy it again for my boys. Flavor is such a personal thing, though, and there are SO many reviews on here with different opinions, so if you're an adventurous sort, try it for yourself. It didn't have a chemical taste to me, just a lot of flavors going on.<br /><br />In reading the other reviews, I don't understand why some people are FREAKING out about there being Splenda in it. So?? Many low-calorie drinks are sweetened with Splenda (sucralose) or Nutrasweet (aspartame), and Splenda is a much better alternative than Nutrasweet. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, then don't get this product! And read the label first...yes, it says there's no aspartame, which may lead people to believe there are NO artificial sweeteners, but a quick glance at the nutrition panel tells you it has sucralose. Those of us who are hypoglycemic appreciate having products with lower sugar available to us, because we have to give up most sweets. If you prefer things with Stevia, then buy unsweetened tea mixes and flavor them yourselves. Toss in a little pineapple juice and honey and knock yourself out. But just because this tea has Splenda doesn't make it a product worthy of scorn. To each his own!"
First of let me say that I love a good Iced green tea. This one is super rich. I diluted per instructions and still needed to add more water to get the right flavor.<br />Needless to say you can really taste the acai and strawberry with the honey sweetness...the tea part...not so much...therefore the 3 stars. If you are looking for an intense flavored drink mix. This one packs a punch and you definitely get your money's worth.<br />If you are looking for a Tea...this might not be up your alley.<br />Definitely the Kool-Aid on the go for adults!!!
"When I first tasted Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, I had to go back and check the calorie count; it tastes like honey and fruit, rich and real. The tea and pineapple take a back seat here, but if mango and honey are in the front seat, I have no problem with that. Mango is one of my favorite flavors, and this mix really tastes like mangoes. Yum!"
"I'm sure everyone is familiar with powdered water flavoring packets.  You just add them to a nice bottle of water, and you're set!  It's convenient and easy!  Well, that's what we have here - yet another contender in the powdered drink mix market.  In terms of being a powdered drink mix, it's okay. The packets open easily enough.  The only think I've noticed is that it takes longer to dissolve than some other ones I've tried in the past, but not excessively so.  It's also fairly low calorie, which is nice.  I'm sure you're all wondering, though, ""is it any good?""<br /><br />Well, at the end of the day, it all comes down to taste.  This is where it goes wrong.  It's got a slightly unpleasant undertone of bitterness and sourness to it that I didn't like.  I mean, it's not the most foul thing I've ever drank, but it's not the best either.  It sort of tastes like fake strawberries and fake honey, which is strange because it claims to be made with ""real ingredients"".  Oh, and even though it's supposedly sweetened with honey, it has added sucralose to it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if tea is something that was just meant to be brewed like normal instead of condensed down into a dissolvable powder.  In fact, the best ""to go"" packet drinks I've had were blatantly fake, but at least they tasted good.  So, do I recommend this drink powder?  Well, if you want a convenient drink powder, then I'd try some other brand.  Although you might like the taste better than I did, so I guess you'll just have to try it yourself!  If you just want tea, then you might be better off just making a big batch of tea and pouring it into some bottles."
"Lipton iced tea has always been my preferred glass during the hot summer months. This new iced tea by Lipton is just okay it is not really what I would call my preferred tea. I'm not sure if it is the honey or the strawberry but it has a funny aftertaste in my mouth. It definitely is a required taste that would take time to get used to, after one has acquired this case it might be very tasty, however I'm not much for a sweet tea. I have drank raspberry iced teas and have liked them but they to are an acquired taste. If you like flavored iced tea this is the tea for you!<br /><br />Try this iced tea at your own risk."
"This is the second green tea drink stick blend I have tried from Lipton, the first being the ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QH41OG"">Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai, 10-Count (1 Box)</a>"".  Mango Pineapple Green Tea is the flavor mixture in question.  I must say that the taste is really good and all the key ingredients shine through.  In other words, I can taste green tea, mango, pineapple and even a touch of honey, yet none of the flavors are too over bearing.<br /><br />These drink sticks (10 in a box) are 5 calories a serving and taste like they are much higher in calories. It took me a little extra effort to mix the powder into the water, but nevertheless the powder dissolved.  I must say there is a slight, slight aftertaste.  It isn't bad per se but it is worth noting.  I didn't find it to be a big deal or would prevent me from purchasing in the future, yet it should be noted.<br /><br />I believe that Lipton has stepped their game up with these drink mixes and I love the idea that green tea is being utilized.  Green tea is underrated so it is nice that it is being promoted more."
"The flavor was okay though for my taste it was a bit too sweet, much more so than with similar products from Crystal Light and Propel.  And the other brands have less of an aftertaste.  But the primary reason for the average rating is that this powder doesn't dissolve easily in water.  I had to stir quite a bit yet sometimes there were still small clumps of powder floating in the drink. I've never had that problem with competitive products and for that reason alone I'm unlikely to buy this product in the future."
"I love the convenience of the single serve pouches and the honey/mango/pineapple flavor is good.  It isn't too sweet or artificial tasting.  However, one packet provides a fairly strong flavor so I prefer to use more water than is recommended, which just means that it is a better value than other drink mixes."
"I used one packet of this in water and, though, it tasted like a sweet tea; the taste was artificial.  I am not too keen on trying this product again."
"It doesn't really taste like tea at all. I like the slight bitterness in tea. But this mostly just tastes sweet. It did dissolve quite well though, even just stirred into a glass of cool water. No shaking necessary."
"There seem to be several new products on the market lately that are designed to enhance the flavor of water. Personally, I think water tastes just fine the way it is, but since I'm also a tea drinker (in mass quantity) I thought I'd try this. It's OK, it's fine, I have no complaints about the taste, though it's a bit on the too sweet side. The taste is kind of familiar and I'm not really sure what it reminds me of, but it tastes a bit like a melted popsicle or like Jello. In fact, it tastes a lot like licking jello powder off of your fingers, come to think of it--which is to say that it's not a bad taste by any means, and kids will probably like it. Also, if like me you drink too much sugar, you might want to give this a try mixed with club soda or seltzer--I imagine it would be good that way. One packet only has five calories. Would I go out of my way to buy it? Probably not, but you never know :) I'm going to try making ice cubes from it next :)"
"The Lipton To Go Stix Strawberry Acai drink has a very pleasant flavor.  Unlike some flavor additives for water (cough...Mio...cough), these are not overly sweet.  The flavor is very well-balanced and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't really taste like tea at all.  For some people, this might be desirable, but I would imagine that most people buying this product would be expecting the green tea flavor to come through more strongly.  In addition, the mix is slow to dissolve.  It didn't seem that any amount of stirring/shaking would completely eliminate the powder.  Over time, the powder dissolves more on its own, but this is definitely not ideal for an instant drink mix.  Overall, I'd say this is worth a try, but not quite living up to the quality I'd hoped for."
"First I want to say that one packet is way too much for 8oz of water. I used 2 packets with 2-quarts of water and this brings a nice, light flavor that does not taste artificial. Using one packet in a bottle of water would make me choke.<br /><br />Second, don't put these packets into your purse or bag.  The starter cut that allows for easy opening of the package is too deep.  I had taken the box to work with me.  When I realized I needed to mix the powder in greater quantity, I put three packets into my work bag.  Between leaving the office and arriving home (with the majority of the trip the bag sat on the passenger seat of my car), all three were open and I had powder everywhere.<br /><br />Lastly, the powder does not completely dissolve, even mixing with more water.  It could be that vigorous shaking of the product in a water bottle would help dissolve better than a spoon in a glass pitcher, but I would expect it to eventually dissolve either way, and this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall, the taste is good but only if you dilute it tremendously.  I was reading another review regarding the sweeteners and there are some excellent points to contemplate in that review.  I'm not even going to discuss what is on the label.  I'm just basing my opinion off my direct experience.<br /><br />My rating is a 3-star.  Had I used as directed, it would probably be a 1-star."
"Each packet of this Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Mango Pineapple is actually good for two servings, according to the printed instructions on the packet.  This was just fine with me since I don't like my drink to be too sweet.  So I tend to just pour a half-packet's worth of contents into a glass filled with very cold water each time I want to use this product, then give the mix a good stir.<br /><br />The drink tastes sweet.  I can discern the tea but not the mango or pineapple.  There is a hint of honey, but the drink's sweetness is probably due to the sucralose, which is listed as the fourth ingredient.  I didn't discern an aftertaste.  Overall, I think it's a fine drink.  Nothing really special to get excited about."
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>The secret to raising Lipton's Mango Pineapple from a 3-star, ho-hum iced tea mix to a delicioso alternative to plain water is serve this Iced Green Tea over finely crushed ice or increase the amount of water used in preparation from 16.9 fl oz to 20 fl oz. The dilution eliminates the cloying sweetness of honey granules and sucralose, allowing the green tea powder and citric acid to bring the right amount of tartness to the mix.<br /><br />Lipton's new drink tastes better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ"">MIO Liquid Peach Tea</a> and should please Crystal Light fans. Personally, I don't enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SS"">Crystal Light Green Tea Peach Mango Drink Mix</a> unless I find it as a fountain drink (again, the addition of crushed ice helps a bunch). Peach flavored instant tea is more common to find but I like Lipton's decision to pair mango and pineapple.<br /><br />Patience is important because the honey granules take additional time to break down into the water. Adding crushed ice helps blend the powder mix faster than with water alone.<br /><br />Lipton's box states that the drink is five calories per 8 oz serving with 60 mg tea flavonoids.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Please be gentle with the video review. It was a family production. My 9-year old son, Kai, handled the filming and my 7-year son, Kou, was a taste tester."
"I found this difficult to mix. The tea granules didn't dissolve easily at all and I had to ""mash"" them against the side of the cup several times to get them to mix. However, this was expected. The instructions on the box says to put the powder into a 16 oz. bottle and shake. We don't use plastic bottles so that wasn't an option. The mix did completely dissolve, eventually.<br /><br />I found the flavor way too sweet for my taste. That's pretty impressive since it's supposed to be only 5 calories, makes me wonder about the amount of artificial sweeteners. The blackberry was all I tasted. I kinda missed the pomegranate and tea flavors though. I detected no honey flavor.<br /><br />I'll drink it again, but I'll dilute it more."
"I got this for my husband who loves green tea.  I would love to not be constantly purchasing all the big jugs, and the idea of having something that generates less trash is incredibly appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he thought there were ""too many different flavors"" in this, and he suggested I let the kids have the rest of the box.  He also complained about a funny aftertaste.  I chalked it up to him just being picky.<br /><br />The kids liked the flavor.  Their complaint was that it is pretty much impossible to mix in a glass (in a water bottle it was easy though).  And they also complained of a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />With all of that, though, they did continue to ask for more until the box was empty.<br /><br />So, mixed reviews from my family."
"Overall not a bad product, just wasn't what I expected when I read the box before trying.  I assumed I would be getting a ""Tea and Honey"" drink with a slight flavor of Strawberry.  Instead, I feel as though I received a strawberry flavored water drink less any sort of tea and honey flavor.  For those of you who might have tried other products similar to this (Crystal Light) it is very close to the same in my opinion.  Now, if you hate plain water this might be perfect for you!  Just don't expect a dramatic taste difference because the words ""Tea & Honey"" are printed on the box.<br /><br />The product does not always ""completely"" dissolve unless you keep stirring or really shake your water bottle but I didn't notice those particles mattered while drinking it.  You could just see small pieces that didn't completely dissolve at the bottom of your cup/bottle of water.<br /><br />The small packets are easy to use, just tear the corner and add to water.  No problems with ease of use!"
"My husband and children, for some reason or other, HATE the taste of regular water so I'm always looking for a way to make the water taste different. We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU"">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again."
"I like the single serve packets, making it a quick grab with a bottle of water for work or school.  The positive is this Lipton Green Tea in Honey, Mango Pineapple flavor is true to taste, offering a real sweet combination of the three flavors.  The negative is that I just couldn't get past the disinct aftertaste from the sucralose additive.  I've tried other lo cal drink mixes, and all basically offer the same flavors with artificial sweeteners to save on the calories.  So unless you enjoy that metallic after-flavor with your drink, pass these up and go with plain and refreshing water or sparkling seltzer."
"I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this ""tea"" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be ""sweetened with honey"" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to ""honey granules"".  Because of this, it has a very strong ""diet"" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste."
"These Lipton To Go Stix are small packets of powder which you mix with water to make a green tea beverage.  I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.<br /><br />Summary:  If you like your iced tea to be very sweet, and you want a diet version, you will probably like this.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Low calorie: only 5 calories.<br />- Taste: Hint of honey up front and a mild green tea flavor coupled with fruit.<br />- Portable:  One small packet makes 16oz<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Very sweet.  This is personal preference.  If you like your iced tea very sweet, you'll probably like this.  I personally like about half the sweetener.  I'm not sure why diet drink makers feel the need to make their artificially-sweetened drinks so sweet.  The main flavor I taste here is the splenda sweetener.<br />- Dissolves slow.  After 60 seconds of stirring there were still a couple of clumps."
"I love the idea of drink sticks, just pour it in a glass and/or water bottle and shake.  A quick and easy way to give water a kick.  I have used plenty of drink sticks and discovered some are better than others.  This blend is by Lipton and the flavor is a decaf green tea with honey and strawberry acai.  The name of this flavor seems like a pretty robust title to live up to.<br /><br />I must say that the flavor is really good, not too sweet but sweet enough.  None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.  My only complaint is that it took me quite a while to mix this powder into the water.  I am not sure why that was the case, but in the large scheme of things this is a minor issue.  For someone who is looking for a good way to spice up their water without too many calories, this drink by Lipton might be a good solution."
"There's only one thing keeping me from giving this a solid 4 star rating: the aftertaste, which I'll get more into later.<br /><br />First, the good. Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.<br /><br />It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.<br /><br />Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.<br /><br />Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.<br /><br />3.4/5"
"Liptons has produced a flavorful concoction and night be precisely what your tatste buds crave on a hot summer day,  However, I find that the single serving size is a bit too sweet, and ultimately overwhelms the flavor of the tea mix.  Merely diluting the mixture really diminishes the tea flavor.  Many of you will not m ind the sweetness, but I believe that the the tea flavor sbould be present.<br /><br />The only fix is to use unflavored Lipton tea, or any herbal tea mix with each packet of flavoSa.<br /><br />Sucralose is the artificial sweeetener thatgives this drink its icky-sweetness.It is allegedly safe as aspartame; and it is definitely OK for use by diabetics.  However, there are disturbing cases of neurological side effects by even casual use of Sucralose.  Those persons suspicious of aspartame might want to avoid sucrlose as well."
"We were happy to see a flavor of instant tea from Lipton that didn't have aspartame in it.<br />Mind you, this tea has THREE sweeteners in it - really? Did it really need so much?<br />I vote a resounding NO. Lipton at least didn't load this one up with aspartame, which is a shocker,<br />but they did use plenty of other sweeteners, then added SUCRALOSE too. Too much. Way too much.<br /><br />The honey adds a really pleasant smooth taste to the tea. Most of us at our house like pomegranate and<br />love blackberries, so thought how bad could it really be?  Answer - BAD.<br /><br />This tea is more like kool-aid than flavored tea.<br />The color is a medium pinkish red, not anything like tea and more like kool-aid.<br />The taste is overly fruity, with hardly any tea taste at all. We tried adding some<br />other instant plain tea to it, and it helped somewhat so the box was not a total loss.<br /><br />Would we buy it again?  Nope, not this one.<br />What could have been a healthy, refreshing tea drink ended up being more of a glass of kool-aid<br />instead. We'll pass."
So i tried this one day and was naseuous after drinking one serving mixed with water.<br /><br />Maybe it was funky artificial mango pineapple taste? Or the artificial sweeteners in it? Either way it was pretty nasty.. I wouldnt drink this again nor offer to anyone.
"These Lipton iced-tea packets are a great concept. Essentially, you can take these little packets anywhere, pour it into a (standard 16.9 fl. oz.) bottle of water, and enjoy some tea. It's quick and easy, but unfortunately these Tea & Honey packets don't seem to actually work very well.<br /><br />The box warns, ""Tea takes longer to dissolve so SHAKE WELL."" This, however, is a pretty big understatement in my experience. After pouring the powder in, I shook the bottle a couple times and found that the powder clumped together immediately. I shook and shook and shook, but to no avail. Certainly, it flavored the water, but there were also big sugar-particles floating around my bottle. I tried it once more but to the same result.<br /><br />It's really a shame because the taste is quite good, much like a pomegranate flavored-water. But along with this good taste, your mouth is filled with an unpleasant amount of sugar clumps. Of course, it would be possible to filter these out with a strainer of some kind, although that would totally defeat the convenience aspect of the product. It's unfortunate."
"As someone who is trying to lower their caffeine intake, I looked forward to recieving this. I enjoy green tea and thought the taste would be refreshing for the summer. Too bad then that it tastes like mango flavored medicine. I took one sip and gave the rest to a relative."
"Blackberry Pomegranate has never let me down before when it comes to flavored drinks.  When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much."
"I find that these travel-sized ""flavor enhancers"" are a mixed bag. Some, such as ""Mio"" Sweet Tea and ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch"" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, ""Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate"", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there. Avoid."
"This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sail under a false flag, by putting ""Tea&Honey"" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ..."
"Do you like the taste of artificial sweetener and generic fruitiness?<br /><br />If yes, try this product.<br /><br />If no, stay well away.<br /><br />Despite the claims of tea, honey, strawberry, and acai on the front of the box, it's the ingredients list that gives away the true flavors. Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this."
"I found the taste to be very strong, so only using half of the package per large cup of water is a good idea.  Even just using half the package, there is still a real lot of flavor and it is hard to believe there isn't a lot of sugar in it, as it tastes so sweet.  You don't have to worry about mixing it, as the package states, as it dissolves well and whatever is left over will dissolve in the next serving anyway.  I found myself going to the water cooler about two to three times more often than normal because it tastes so good.  Both the flavors I had were good so you will probably be pleased with any of the flavors you try."
"I added a package of the lipton to go to a 16.9 oz water bottle like the instructions say. I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky."
"While this is a tasty tea I found that it was a little too sweet for one 16 oz bottle of water. I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more. It still has a ""diet"" aftertaste which I'm not thrilled about, but I do appreciate that it doesn't have aspartame in it. These handy packets would be good to travel with, especially when traveling abroad where you shouldn't drink anything other than bottled water. I also thought that the nutritional information is a little misleading. The front of the package boasts that it's only five calories per 8 oz serving, but these are made to be poured directly into a 16 oz bottle of water so in reality there are two servings per packet, making it ten calories. Not a lot of a difference, but for a calorie counting person it is a difference."
"What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself ""Green Tea Mix"". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along."
"for those of us who have bad reactions to this crap they put in our food, SHAME SHAME ON YOU LIPTON"
"This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide.  There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this."
"This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sailing under a false flag, by putting ""Tea&Honey"" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br />But, not deterred by that, I prepared a glass for a brave self-mutilating test - YIKES.<br />Artificial taste, very sweet, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste, just totally and utterly horrible.<br />Blackberry/Pomegranate? Yeah, I guess if you know what the label claims it should taste like, you could actually imagine that for a second or two - there is a hint of that in this drink, but at a very faint level. It has some, well, mummified blackberries in it, too, but that is an almost comical detail.<br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air.

I am always looking for new flavors to add to my water bottles.  I like blackberries and pomegrantes.  This flavor stick leaves an aftertaste in my mouth that I didn't like very much.  I have had some better tasting flavors (see my review for the Lipton strawberry flavor).  I really couldn't get past the after taste.  I probably will not be getting this flavor again.
"Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One ""stick"" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state ""Artificial Sweetener"" and or ""Diet"" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?"
"So, I thought I was getting a great deal on this product. My fault I guess for not reading the reviews and just going by the Lipton description: ""sweetened with honey"". Sucralose ... ""Splenda"" is the actual sweetener NOT honey. The sickening artificial taste ruins what could have been a lovely product. Splenda is not a natural product, has no relation to honey and along with other reviews - also gives me fierce migraines. For an added kick, these are not available for returns. Shame on Lipton! Last Lipton product I will ever buy!"
"Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai is a iced tea mix that comes in packets that you add to a bottle of water. Easy and convenient for on the go.<br /><br />It has a strong strawberry flavor but it leaves a a strong aftertaste that I didn't like.<br /><br />It's supposed to be sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors but I didn't taste the honey and it wasn't that sweet, kind of a bitter taste."
"To be fair, I think I'd give any of these miniature packets of ""healthy"" ""water boosters"" a two-star review. They're just not all that tasty, and all have a nasty aftertaste from the artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This product almost earned itself a one-star review because in addition to the aftertaste, there are little crumbly bits in it that just aren't a pleasant thing to encounter in a beverage. It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice."
I liked it a lot.  Not too sweet and very fruity.  I liked being able to have it available for a refreshing drink where ever i might be.  I would recommend it.
I was trying all of the honey tea flavors that came out and I am not a fan of this one. The other two I tried were actually fairly good but this one had an awful flavor to it. Doesn't even remotely taste like what strawberry anything would taste like. I would buy a different flavor.
"Rather a disappointment, really. Overly sweet, this is more like honey-mango-pineapple Kool-aide. Almost sickly-sweet, the green tea aspect is totally lost. And what's more, it is grainy and difficult to completely dissolve, resisting even the most vigorous stirring spoon. Two stars only because my four-year-old kind of likes it."
"This doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste like tea, either. This tastes like Kool-Aid, the sugar free kind. The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass."
I drink A lot of bottled water - especially when traveling. Plain gets old quickly so I tried a sample of this product and immediately ordered the 12-pack. Pour it in - shake the bottle - and you're ready. Just that easy and the taste is great. Not too sweet and the mix of tea and lemon is just right for my taste. This will be a regular reorder item for me. A great price and quick delivery from Amazon makes it even better.
"I need a low-calorie drink, I have no problems with the Sucralose. I love, love, love the taste and yes it is strong, I generally make it with 24 to 32 ounces of water, after ice has been added. It tastes just like the original Lipton tea stix before they changed to ""aspartame,"" a sweetener I have to avoid at all costs. If you'd had a migraine for 2 solid weeks with no relief, you would understand my joy.<br /><br />I will be buying this, this coming October and from then on, as I usually drink at least 2-3 glasses a day of this minimum. Thank you Lipton for listening to the needs of the many."
"This was my first drink mix and since then I've tried others to get a better sense if what I observed and tasted was present in all mixes or unique to Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Honey, and Pomegranate. Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth. Other than this, I think it's refreshing and tasty drink mix."
"as a tea, this stuff is terrible!<br /><br />However, you can use it to sweeten tea made from a tea bag & it is useful.<br />I wish I had not bought so much.  The Sucralose level is so high, that the artificial sweetning level is off the charts - in a bad way.  The tea flavor is not very good, but OK.  I tried diluting it more, but the tea becomes diluted & it just tast like weaker YUCK.  The lemon flavor is not mild either.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan of this product at all."
"The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than ""tea."" It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the ""Stix"" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix."
"I first purchased Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie in the Caramel Apple flavor. While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and again, it was tasty and fulfilling, but was I in love with it? No, not really...<br /><br />I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!<br /><br />I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how ""fresh"" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)"
"About two years ago, I used to buy these cookies all the time from Amazon.  I loved them, but they disappeared from the website for a long time!  Finally, I found them again and excitedly purchased a new batch.  They're different than they used to be--they're more dry, hard, and have much fewer chocolate chunks in them.  I think they might have 20 or 40 fewer calories in them, though.  But I would much rather have back the soft, moist, chocolatey cookies I knew and loved."
"the breakfast cookie, Peanut butter chocolate chip is delicious, it seemed they grew on me, my husband warms them in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the chocolate!"
"We gave these a try during an Amazon sale on Erin Baker products.  I really didn't expect them to be as wonderful as they were.  Immediately upon receipt we stuck them in the freezer (as instructed on the package to maintain freshness).  When we need a quick on-the-go breakfast that packs a yummy yet healthy punch, it's easy to grab one of these and eat it on the run.  The taste and texture are both really good with no odd flavors, just a subtle peanut butter flavor punctuated by chocolate.<br />Our family will definitely reorder these and try the other Erin Baker varieties!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this healthy, yummy option for families on the go!"
I was not sure about these are the Chocolate Vegan cookies the reviews were all over the place.  I ordered being concerned.  These cookies are good.  Agree they don't have a lot of peanut flavor.  I froze mine when they arrived.  I microwave them 35 seconds in the mornings.  They are wam and good.  I usually have oatmeal or a clif bar.  These are more filling than the clif bar.  Will buy them again.
"The only real drawback to this cookie is that there's no real ""peanut butter cookie"" taste.  The texture is wonderful: chewy, moist, with lots of chocolate chunks.  It tastes more like a regular oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, but not as ""sugary"" sweet.  I have tried many of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and this is probably my second favorite.  The Double Chocolate Chunk is wonderful!  I have also tried the Caramel Apple, which was good, and the Morning Glory, which is very good.  I am just more of a chocolate and peanut butter type of gal.  I will always keep these in my freezer.  I take one out the night before, and bring it to work with me for breakfast.  They are simply marvelous!!"
"First I would like to say that I am not Vegan.  I bought these because I had hoped there would be less fat and more peanut butter flavor.  The Peanut butter flavor is there but it isn't very strong.  I could taste banana and cinnamon more than I could taste anything else.  The chocolate had an odd flavor but that could be because it wasn't made with milk.  Even after all of this, the cookies are still very good.  My kids love them and try to eat them as snacks.  We have tried several other flavors and this is one of the best ones.  I still love the chocolate chunk the best :)"
What a great idea. It's like a delicious cookie instead of a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast. Mornings are awful for people like me who suffer from arthritis. This is a no cook solution that truly satifies. And it is also full of fiber.
"I love these breakfast cookies, heated in toaster oven really brings out the flavor.  I was looking for a snack that was nutritious and filling.  They travel well with the individual wrapping. I need to eat every few hours and these really fit my needs."
This breakfast cookie tastes great and keeps you full all morning long. I like the flavor and the soft chewy texture.
"We get these on subscription, keep these in the freezer as recommended, and toast them for a few minutes in a regular toaster... Remove them carefully, and they are a wonderful VEGAN breakfast treat!"
"The cookies arrived on time, and they were safely packaged in a refrigerator bag. The cookies taste amazing, the texture was smooth, and chewy, I could taste the peanut butter, and the chocolate chunks were a perfect addition to the cookie. Afterwards, I was pretty satisfied.  I highly recommend it as a snack, breakfast food, even a dessert. Although, I only bought it once the price was little bit too high for my budget, of course if with more room in my budget I would buy it again."
"These are delicious and filling!  I like that they're vegan!  They're a filling breakfast for on the run days!  The big thing about these breakfast cookies is that they need to be refrigerated.  We didn't do that once and several cookies grew mold in just a couple days of room temperature.  This is also a problem because ups sometimes leaves them on our front steps rather than our porch and they have gone unnoticed for a couple days a few times that we've ordered them.  Erin Baker's customer service is really friendly and helpful, and the cookies actually taste better cold than room temperature!!"
"When I moved away from Bellingham, where this business is based, these cookies are one of the things I missed. I'm so happy to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Note that these are not cookie-cookies: they aren't the baked version of candy. They are sorta dry, hearty, not too sweet, and extremely filling. They will get you through to lunch, and go very well with coffee, tea, milk, or whatever you drink in the morning. They also make a good on-the-run lunch food: an alternative to the overly sweet ""sports"" bars or ""meal-replacement"" bars."
"My husband found these cookies at the expo for his first marathon and we've been hooked ever since. We would often stock up at the grocery store when they went on sale for $1. Since then, we've moved and can't find them in a grocery store, but the internet always sells the things you want!! I like the Double Chocolate Cherry Chunk the best, but the cookies with peanut butter and chocolate are great too!<br /><br />As for getting them shipped - the quality of the cookie seems to vary from shipment to shipment. I've not gotten cookies that are ""bad"" but often squished or some times close to expiration. (that could happen with any grocery product purchased on line)<br /><br />As I said, my husband found these through running, so they're clearly good for that (needing extra calories after 15 miles). I also enjoyed them while pregnant and now nursing, since I need extra calories. I've looked for an alternative (something slightly cheaper) but other brands do not use all natural ingredients and are generally not as good for you. I've also found other brands have smaller portion sizes, so be careful when comparing.<br /><br />Bottom line - have and would recommend to friends. Try other flavors if you don't like this one."
"All of the Erin Baker cookies are a good alternative to protein and energy bars for a pre or post-workout snack when you need something portable and easy to eat.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I have no problem with them. These are not Nestle's toll house cookies, they have more fiber and less sugar and fat weight for weight, so they aren't meant to be desert treats.<br /><br />They serve their purpose-a high density, nutritious snack that will supply you with energy when you need it.  With subscribe and save, they are less than a dollar each, and provide more sustained energy than a candy bar, and better taste and texture than a protein bar, which tend to be low in fiber."
"We love thier Granola and thought thier cookies would be as good - not so much. Other than the chocolate chunks, there is not much flavor."
i find these cookies wonderful. i am a vegan and look on amazon frequently to find new things to eat that are not at my local stores or too expensive at organic markets.<br /><br /> amazon recommended this company to me. sadly they only have two vegan flavors that i saw. but i went out on a limb to get these and i am happy i did so.<br /><br /> they do not have a super strong peanut butter taste but you know it is there and there are good size chunks of chocolate. i havent had it heated yet but by others reviews i see i should and i bet it is tasty. the calories are a little high 320 but when you look at other things you can have for breakfast this is not a bad deal. i think it is good to know that these are made fresh. i stuck mine in the freezer so i dont feel like i have to have one everyday for 12 days so they do not go bad.<br /><br />i have just purchased the other vegan flavor and got another one of these so i can have them ready when i want them in the freezer. i think i will keep these as a regular in my amazon purchases.<br /><br />deff worth a try.
"These are very good for being healthy and vegan. Again, if you're basing your decision of whether or not to buy based on the word 'cookie' you are likely going to be disappointed. If you're looking for nutrition on the go, these are going to be a hit. They taste good (especially warmed) and are filling."
"So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors. I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a peanut butter cookie. The chocolate chocolate chunk ones are three stars too for the same reason. The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!"
"I love these ""breakfast cookies"". I was looking for something to bring to school since I have a block of classes from 10:00 am - 4:15 pm and no time to grab something to eat in between. These do a great job to keep me from getting hungry during lecture and they're delicious and gigantic. Love the peanut butter chocolate chunk flavor, and I'll be trying other flavors once I run out!"
"I've had bad experiences with eating vegan products before, but these were made very well.  They taste like their non-vegan counterparts and are even better when toasted in the toaster.  I may just buy these again."
"I love Erin's breakfast cookies.  There are bigger than I expected and I actually feel full and satisfied after eating one.  I would much rather eat these for breakfast, then a granola bar.  I haven't had any mold issues and I've ordered these several times now.  They are the best toasted.  I eat them for breakfast at work quite often and they can also be microwaved for a few seconds.  Just enough to get the chocolate a little melted.  Mmm!"
"Of course this is just my opinion but read the label!I have written other reviews for these so Ill try to be a little different.  The ingredients are impressive. We have so far purchased the CARAMEL APPLE:love the gooey texture and a definite hit with everyone, PEANUT BUTTER  and CHOCOLATE CHUNKS;Not too much peanut butter taste and  just the right amount of chocolate pieces, love the chocolate pieces melted and squishy FRUIT AND NUT; Love the texture of the nuts in this one. great flavor. BANANA  AND WALNUT; reminds me of banana bread kind of in a cookie.Love texture of walnuts. All the cookies are moist.  Freeze them immediately as they have no preservatives. Microwave them about 25 seconds or more to your liking. Yummy!  They are soooo good.  I have a bile duct disease and have to be careful what I eat.  I can eat these for a week, with lots of fluids, for every meal and two snacks (5 a day) and I feel better and have more energy. Most importantly, I do not have the terrible stomach pains as I do with most everything else I eat. We are going to order the automatic monthly order of 10-12 bags a month. These are addictive. we are out right now and  I just ordered more. Hate the waiting! These are easy for my mom, who has Alzheimers to fix too. She and my son love them. Please try these. You won't be sorry.  They are affordable at about 1.00 a cookie which is a meal for us and healthy eating."
These are really tasty and this is one of my favorite flavors.  Some mornings I have to eat breakfast on the run and these keep me full for a while.  Love 'em!
I got these because I have tried the other vegan flavor that I like. These don't taste like peanut butter at all to me. I can taste a prune flavor. Looking at the ingredients prune puree is listed before the peanut butter. This explains the flavor issue I have with them. I won't purchase them again.
These are big tasty cookies!..microwave them for no more than twenty seconds and you will have a cookie experience worth having!!..Great value and very addicting!
"I bought these in hopes that my kids would like to eat them on their way out the door.  So dissapointing!  These are so gross!  I can barely even tolerate them.  We eat so healthy so it is not that we aren't used to healthy good food.  WE always eat whole wheat and we are always eating fruits and Vegi's.  You all can't say that it is because we aren't used to healthy eating.  Now, back to the cookies...they just are gross. I don't know what else to say, they are dry and tasteless discs comparable to cardboard.  So very bummed out that they aren't what we were hoping for.  Back to granola bars I guess.  :( O and just cause it says cookies does not mean it is good."
"This is one of the most tasteless things I have ever tasted. If I could have sent them back, I would have. CAS"
"Cookie is 350 calories<br />Big Suprise to me, a bowl of Coco Pebbles is only 160"
"I was looking for a strawberry tea that I tried long time ago and absolutely loved. That tea was brought from Germany so I thought I will not find it here. This tea is exactly the same - flavorful, little sweet and tart at the same time and smells like heaven. Has fresh dried strawberries and tea leaves. Would recommend to berry lovers. It is DELICIOUS!"
"I am a Teavana tea freak, love the stuff, but this one tastes very odd.  Has an odd chalk flavor similar to tums or pepto, very odd can't figure it out.  Big dissapointment, especially at the price!"
Great stuff and soooooo good! I purchased this for my wifes new diet but I am drinking it more than she is! It is delicious and smells great! A must buy folks.
"This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.  The only thing I don't understand is the price.  This frosting is $1.50 a tube at Wal-Mart."
"Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make ""ladybug spots and antennae,"" which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug ""heads"") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness."
"I hate making black icing at home, there's always an after taste from the food coloring and it ends up being a big mess. The Wilton tubes of black icing are great for frozen buttercream transfers when I decorate a birthday cake and much easier to handle."
"I started making fondant cakes a few months ago.  This works great for the finishing touches to the cakes without having to mix up your own colored frosting, which saves a ton of time!"
"I was so excited to get this starter kit in the mail! It has everything you need to get started, all you need is the fillings/toppings... The book it came with was note great, so I ordered the Sushi for Dummies book. Overall this was way worth the money!"
I bought this item for my husband for father's day and he really loved it. He has been wanting to learn to make sushi and this item is really great for beginners.
"I gave this product poor reviews because they do not allow returns and yet my product arrived damaged. The shipping box itself was in great condition, but the item must have been damaged before shipping.  One corner was badly smashed in. Who did the quality control here?  I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift for the holidays as is."
"Let me start with the positive: This set has the potential to make a great gift.  Sure you could go out and buy the idividual items for a cheaper price (and if you are purchasing for yourself I would recommend that).  But it is a nice set to give as a gift.  It comes packaged in a nice box, and if you receive it in good condition your gift will be a hit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I decided to look past the several negative reviews regarding the busted bag of rice.  I figured this issue must have been solved by now and/or couldn't possibly happen to me as well.  I was dead wrong.  I just received my package and just as others have explained, the bag of rice was busted and the entire box is full of loose rice.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I was very excited about this gift.  I even purchased several other sushi-related items to give along with it.  Unfortunately, I would be embarrassed to give this gift in the condition I received it. Now I have 4 days until Christmas to come up with a whole new plan.  Thanks for nothing Amazon.<br /><br />If you are a risk taker, go ahead and give it a shot.  Maybe you will be luckier than the rest of us and receive a perfectly good set."
A 4 star reading only for the fact that it hasn't been used yet.  Its for a gift.  Product arrived quickly as promised.
"If you buy these items seperately, it should only cost you about 10 bucks. And you don't really need the book since you can look it up online. I got this whole set just buying the items seperately for about 10 bucks. Don't get ripped off..."
The item arrived well within the shipping guidelines.  Everything was delicious and I am incredibly happy with my purchase.
"Good quality watch, received less than 2 days after purchase and I did not pay for overnight shipping (picked the cheapest one.) Would definitely order from them again."
"I place an order for this kit on december first and was told it should arrive on the 6th. I've not received my product, not heard from the manufacturers, not able to find a number or anything for me to contact them and want this product for my brother for christmas. So if anyone could help me, I would appreciate it. This is my first time every using amazon before as well. Not such a good first impression..."
"This product is much harder to use than described.  The receipes are easy to follow, but the rolling is very difficult, and the insructions were vague, I found myself having to turn to the internet to look up instructions and rolling techniques.  The ingredients were all very high quality, but all were available in my local supermarket. Would not recommend."
This is a nice kit with high quality items.  This kit includes:<br /><br />Sushi Chef Cookbook<br />Short-grain Rice<br />Nori for wrapping the sushi<br />Pickled Ginger<br />Spicy Wasabi Horseradish<br />Dark Soy Sauce<br />Rice Vinegar<br />Sushi Vinegar<br />Rice Paddle<br />Bamboo Mat for rolling-up your creations<br /><br />I had a blast creating my own sushi!
"This kit includes all the dry components to make sushi, and its a great starter kit.  However, I was disappointed by the book that was included.  I expected a book with colorful pictures and a variety of different types of sushis you can make, etc.  The book was not easily organized and not colorful, and only included a few sushi recipees.  I would recommend getting another book to supplement your sushi making desires."
"This kit is a great gift idea and a really good way to start making yer very own bonafide sushi -- both nigiri (rice ball) and maki (roll). All you need is an expert fish buyer, a knife that is sharp as h**l, and some itty bitty little bowls for soy sauce. Everything else is IN THE BOX. Sushi Chef brand soy sacue is the best soy sauce you ever had, IMHO.<br /><br />The little instruction booklet is great. Of course, this kit is no substitute for years of apprenticeship with a Tokyo master chef, but, if you have some appreciation for the aesthetic of sushi and a flare for D.I.Y. and access to sushi-grade fish, then this is the kit for you."
"It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less.  This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't!<br /><br />But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi.  Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!!  It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says ""toasted nori""!  The cookbook is just terrible.  In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it!  But you learn what you realy need to do quickly.<br /><br />Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the ""kit"" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started."
"I have been a sushi fan for many years, but have always been shy about making it myself.  After searching online at the dozens of different options, I decided to go with the Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Too many sushi kits out there offer just the rolling mat, or dishes and the rolling mat, but no spoon, or all the dishes but no edible components.<br /><br />With this kit, you have the mat, the spoon, and all the edibles necessary sans the actual fillings (fish, veggies, etc.)  And not only does the kit have edible components, they are top notch.  The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease.  The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere.<br /><br />But, the best part of this kit is the manual.  It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos.  As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend.  I made darned good sushi my very first try.<br /><br />Criticisms?  Hmmm... not many.  The price is right.  Maybe it'd be nice if they had a special ""sushi knife"" or something enclosed, but whatever.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking to make sushi at home for the first time, you won't be sorry with this purchase."
I believe this product is good for the beginner and is helpful however when I received mine the two bottles of vinegar were not sealed properly and the wasabi seal was clearly broken. I do not fault amazon as they quickly provided me with a refund. Other than that i think the product was helpful especially the bamboo mat for rolling the sushi.
I bought this as a present for a very good friend. Because of the price I paid for it I was expecting something really nice. I was very disappointed to see that the kit was made up of very cheap items that if bought individually will come up to 1/3 of the price. The kit contains mainly ingredients not sushi making equipment. I would suggest that you look around for a better more reasonable set.
"The kit gave us the kick in the butt we needed to start making our own sushi, but if we had really sat down and thought about it, we could have saved about half just buying the stuff ourself. You can buy most of what you need at your local grocery store.  Would I recommend this product?  Only if you are lazy like us!"
"I really love this kit!  I use it once a day for lunch and it's also a favorite of my daughter.  All the products are high quality (in fact when I needed to replace them I bought some cheap stuff and then ended up going back for the more expensive....believe me, don't skimp).  I love the fact that it breaks everything down in the instructions.  If you are new to making sushi, I suggest this kit.  I am 100x faster and better that when I started as a novice."
"I would buy this again, with a caveat. Some of the parts of this kit were of poor quality. The Nori, seaweed for rolling, was of poor quality, brittle and broken and unusable.  The instructions are adequate.  The kit includes everything and is a good place to start. If it were not for a few poor quality parts, I would give it a 5 star. Use Saran wrap on your roller and life will be easier. Following instructions for rice came close to burning rice  instructions not fully complete, limp recipes.  I wanted something all in one to start out, and this provided it, found out some of the components were of poor or mediocre quality."
"This is a great set with all of the ingredients needed to make sushi, besides the fresh items. The items in the kit are good for multiple sushi making sessions. The only improvement would be to include more Nori, as there was only enough to make sushi for four one time. The kit comes with a recipe book which has clear directions and many sushi ideas. I would definately buy this kit again."
"This is a basic kit that may be of use to a beginner living in the sushi wilderness--away from large cities with Asian stores or even supermarkets that regularly carry Asian cooking ingredients. But if you have access to such locally, this kit is a waste of money. The most functional part of the kit is the ""sushi mat"", which is a collection of bamboo ""straws"" lined up and tied together to provide a rollable surface to make maki rolls. The rice spatula is a useful device, but the two of these together should cost about $2, although some supermarkets charge up to $5-7 for the privilege. The rest of the items--mainly food ingredients--are low quality and preservative laden. For half the price of the kit, one could pick up a tube of prepared wasabi (doesn't last as long as the powder but is usually more potent and easier to deal with) or a small can of powder (both about $3 each), a bottle of basic Kikkoman soy sauce (far higher quality even in the basic supermarket variety--will set you back between $2 and $4, depending on location and promotions). A pack of nori sheets will set you back another $5-6, unless you only shop at Whole Foods. The most expensive item might be the rice vinegar--pretty much any Japanese or pseudo-Japanese brand will do (Nakano [same as Mizkan], Mitsukan, and Marukan are the most common). With soy sauce and with vinegar, it's important to get the Japanese, not the Chinese varieties, as the flavors and concentrations will differ. The vinegar should always be unseasoned--then follow almost any internet recipe for seasoning sushi rice. Seasoned vinegars tend to be overflavored (salt, sugar) and are generally less desirable, although they will do in a pinch. Ideally, you should have a bottle of mirin (usually billed as ""rice wine"") on hand, but can either skip it entirely and add a touch more vinegar or use dry sherry in small quantities. The packaged pickled ginger (gari), including the one in the kit, is often an overly sour, cough-syrup-tasting mess. Unless you are going to make your own, you might as well skip it entirely. The enclosed rice is short grain, but not a high-quality sushi variety. You can just as well do with commercial short-grain rice (avoid long-grain or perfumed rice, such as basmati or jasmine). If you can get a hold of one of the Japanese brands (all grown in California!), so much the better.<br /><br />Aside from preparing the rice, you really don't need a cookbook and paying about $20 extra for it is really not a worthwhile exercise. The beauty of sushi is that you can pick and choose the ingredients that go in as ""stuffing"". If you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of raw vegetables and cooked ingredients that you can find. If raw fish is your bag, be careful where you buy it and how you store it--some regulations require sushi-grade fish to be deep-frozen once, then thawed properly before sale. If this is not done properly, the flesh will be off-color, watery and fibrous, as if after a freezer-burn. Supermarket grade raw salmon is not a good substitute either, as it is not handled with proper standards of cleanliness for sushi-grade fish. Avoid lake fish, as they often contain parasites (killed in proper cooking). When out of options, you can always use smoked salmon from a supermarket, other kinds of smoked fish or imitation crab flakes. The best option may be a lightly seared tuna steak, but these are very expensive. Fresh-caught saltwater fish is usually OK. Vegetables can be raw or cooked, but they should be cut into 1/4"" strips for use in maki rolls (or sliced diagonally for nigiri). Assembly is simple--for nigiri, just make an oblong rice ""ball"" from seasoned rice assemble all the ""toppings"" in reverse order on one hand, pick up the rice ball with the other, then join them together and lightly crimp the toppings on top of the rice. You can use a small dollop of wasabi as a binder, placing it on top of the rice ball before attaching the toppings. If maki assembly instructions don't come with your sushi mat, all you need to know is that the layer of rice should be about 1/4"" thick and the ""toppings"" or ""stuffing"" go across the mat, closer to the edge from which you start rolling. Also, leave about 1/2"" of nori uncovered, so that you can seal the edge once the maki is rolled up. It is quite common to line the sushi mat with two layers of plastic wrap (on both sides!) to simplify the process (and, in some cases, to satisfy sanitary regulations--not applicable at home). Other than the amount, there are really no limits on toppings, as long as they are not liquid.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the kit is serviceable, but with middling or low quality ingredients. It will do in a pinch, but is overpriced and somewhat overhyped. Don't expect to come up with sushi-bar-quality rolls from it, but if you're a novice, this makes for a good introduction."
"First things first, this is a great kit.  My girlfriend and I love sushi and love to try new cooking.  So I thought that this would be a great idea.  And it was. We had so much fun creating our own rolls with ease, and produced a very edible california roll on our first attempt.  The only thing I would recomend is take where you live into consideration.  We live in a small town where there is no asian food markets(within two to three hours) and where we get our fish is from the local Albertsons. Granted, we bought a tuna steak, that the butcher told me was sushi grade, and it turned out really good for cheap, but the other sushi grade fish that I would like to have is not available, such as eel or soft shelled crab or any type of fish eggs.<br /><br />In short on our first sushi night we created two cali rolls, a spicy tuna, our own twist on a philly roll, and a makeshift tempura roll.  All with the kit and some items from the store.  And all were really good.  But my favorites arent do-able, like unagi or a rainbow roll or anything with masago because of where we live. So just think about it.<br /><br />But great gift idea for cheap, or for a relationship date night item. We had so much fun"
Got this just a week ago so I could send hubby with better lunches for work. I love the kit. Everything in it is delicious.<br /><br />I have only one gripe. The method for making sushi rice with a pan. Skip it. Just bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to medium low and watch it. I am looking for brown rice to use for this(I know its supposed to be a no-no but they had to use something like it when they first started making sushi- white rice being a recent thing) but can't find any fat rice.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy. it takes a little getting used to and yes.. buy more Nori sheets. It runs out quick.
"Whatever you do, don't follow their instructions for steaming rice. You will end up with a burnt pot of crap.  Secondly, there isn't enough rice in the package for a second try.  Go buy some short grain rice and follow the package instructions for cooking/steaming rice. Then go back to the Sushi Chef instructions for cooling/seasoning the rice. Good thing I spent all that time preparing ingredients for making sushi while the rice was burning. Now I have to go out for more rice."
i purchased this set as a gift for someone with little sushi making experience. i did read the product description but was still surprised by how many items came in the package. it came with everything you need minus the fresh fish and veggies. it was put to use at our superbowl party and there was plenty sushi to go around. i was very impressed and the recipient loved it. i would recommend it and would buy it again. sushi chef is awesome.
"Despite my niece telling me that what we make with this kit would ""never taste like restaurant sushi,"" we had tremendous fun and made some absolutely delicious California rolls, according to my whole family!  Sushi-making is not for the faint of heart...or those who have a short attention span....as it takes some reading and study to make the rice (cook over this heat, lower to this heat, let sit for xxx minutes, cool quickly by fanning for xx minutes, etc.) properly.  It is also labor-intensive to prepare all the fillings if you want a variety of rolls (we had shrimp, lobster product, crab product, salmon, and even homemade chicken salad).  But in the long run, we had such fun and were so proud of the finished rolls displayed on the plates with the side of ginger that it was most definitely worth it.<br /><br />One tip: make sure you have a really, really sharp knife, and that you clean it with a wet cloth between slices--you'll be glad you did!<br /><br />I have some criticism of the book which could be more organized, explain steps much better, and, in fact, it would be wonderful if the kit included a CD of how to make the different types of sushi, since it is somewhat complicated.  For this reasonm, I would definitely recommend that a beginner find a video on YouTube that shows how the make sushi--very helpful.<br /><br />One other criticism is that I think the kit should include more than just 10 sheets of nori.  Half the bag of sushi rice was just about right for making 10 california rolls, so now I have another half bag rice left (and of course plenty of ginger and the condiments)."
"I've never made sushi before, but I've always loved it and really wanted to give it a go. After purchasing this item, my wife and I put on a little get together with a bunch of our friends. The hardest part is making the rice which took a little over 2 hours to be ready. Making the rolls turned out to be a lot easier then anticipated, though you definitely want to try and cover your bamboo roller in clear wrap or something similar to avoid complications. The little book that came along with the set does explain quite a bit of what you'll want to do when preparing your ingredients and how to pay attention to detail. I actually went on Youtube and they have some videos showing you how to make the same rolls from the Sushi Chef Kit which was a real life saver. Everything turned out great and our guest's left happy."
"I bought this at a reduced price because I have always wanted to make sushi the right way yet never got around to getting a kit. Everything is included in this (except the main ingredients of course) and it is easy to get started. Although the book may be hard to follow in some places, it is overall a good guide. The included ingredients (rice, soy sauce, ginger, etc.) are all top quality though I would have preferred something a bit more natural. When these run out I will try looking elsewhere for the same quality but maybe also organic. A really great gift for someone who loves sushi but hasn't made any themselves."
"Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for $23.00 on the Amazon Gold Box email this represents excellent value for everything that's included.<br /><br />We bought a separate sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're happily getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before."
didn't live up to my expectation.as others have said can go and purchase same items at a cheaper price.very disappointed
"Bought this over a year ago and we love using this, especially to host sushi making parties. It is a lot of fun to have people over and use this kit, plus fresh ingredients from the market to create our own home-made sushi creations. This also makes a great gift for any fan of sushi, even if they are at best an amateur cook."
"I have been buying sushi fixings for several years, and this kit gives you everything you need at a terrific price.  If you're planning a sushi dinner party, this kit is just as good as the items in your your local Japanese store (and at a very comparable price)."
I recieved this product as a gift for a friend.  When he opened it we found that there was mold present.  Not a fan and very disappointing.
"This product was very fun & easy to use. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. The first time he made the rice, it came out perfectly. The directions are very clear and everything included is useful. Just make sure you have a very sharp knife!"
This was a gift for my daughter on her birthday.  We all loved it and enjoyed how well the sushi turned out.
I love experimenting and sushi was the next on my list.. This product made it so easy! I would definitely recommend this Sushi Kit to my family and friends.
"This is the set that got us started on our own sushi roll making adventures!  I love having the package together to get me started, as the oriental grocery stores in the nearby city can be a little daunting.  Buy this to begin your sushi making along with this book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764544659"">Sushi For Dummies</a>.  You'll probably want the physical book because you'll want to have it on hand when actually ROLLING the sushi and your fingers will be so dirty, you won't want to mess up your kindle."
Nice kit with everything you need to start making sushi except the veggies and fish.  Of course you could just go out and buy all of this at the store.  No issues with freshness of the products.
"we have had a few small ""sushi-making"" parties at the house since getting this kit and have really enjoyed it. the kids even like it because we can make them rolls with what they like inside. we have a kid who doesnt eat seafood but really likes a roll with deli roast beef, a scallion and some sharp cheddar. we roll it with rice and he dunks it in a little worcestershire sauce.<br />i definitely recommend this kit. great starter set..."
"Excellent product, detailed instructions on how to prepare the rice. Has a few recipes for rolls, would have liked a few more, but that's what the internet is for. Was very nice having everything right out of the box. I would suggest using a zip-lock bag or plastic wrap for the rolling mat if you wish to preserve it for future use. The sushi I made turned out pretty amazing, all on my first try.<br /><br />I would suggest this product to anyone who is interested in this hobby."
Bought as a gift for my mom. She loves it  and brings it over whenever we do sushi even though we have our own set.
"This had everything in it that we needed to make our own sushi rolls, but the quality of the food inside the kit (rice, ginger, wasabi, and seaweed) was pretty poor.  The tools in it (rolling mat and spoon) and we enjoyed it.  Wouldn't buy a second kit, but the first one was worth it."
"I purchased this as part of an anniversary gift for my husband. We haven't used it yet, but he was very excited to receive it and can't wait to use it! It was also delivered very quickly!"
"This is a pretty basic kit, and fine for beginners, but the items aren't the best quality. Personally, I'd opt for something better at the same price from sushinut which is where I get my sushi grade fish anyway. Sushi kits are always better when some thought was put into it, this is just one brand's stuff, for better or worse, but I'd opt for better quality for myself and my friends."
"Birthday presents for a 13 year old girl can be difficult.  You can't buy them clothes, because they will probably hate them, the gadget they do want is way too expensive, and cash is just not personal enough.  This gift was a life saver!  For less than $50.00, it was a personal, ""cool"" gift that everyone was ecstatic about!  Thank you Amazon for suggesting this!  We love it :)"
"Great place for beginners to start. Has all the necessities. And great quality. Not flimsy like other kits out there, longer lasting products."
"I love Sushi and especially california rolls. Everytime I buy it,<br />I get upset for paying so much for it. So I decided, thats it time I try preparing it. Guess what?I enjoy making it! This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need to learn how to prepare it. If you master the rice preparation, then you got it made. I love the<br />little cook book. Its more like a instruction booklet. Its great.<br />Thats all you need really. I have made the california rolls two<br />weekends in a row. I will go on to sushi making, once I master this. I still need practice in rolling it, using the mat that came with the kit.<br />I highly recommend this Kit to those who are just beginning to learn how to prepare it. You will spend more, if you go looking for all the ingredients. This Kit has it all!!!And Guess what?Its sooooo much cheaper than in the restaurant!!"
My daughter love's Sushi and menitoned she would like a kit for Christmas so she could make her own at home when the urge for Sushi struck her.  I reviewed many online and thougt this was one that would be good for a beginner.  She was thrilled and has since made some beautiful Sushi with the kit.  This was a great value.
"I bought this product for a friend, he loved it!!  He couldn't wait to make some sushi over the holidays!  Great product!"
"This was a xmas gift for a cook that recently started enjoying sushi. Like the description says, it does contain everything needed to get started. The book is a bit small, but not bad.<br /><br />It's an impressive box, she thought I spent at least $75 on the kit.<br /><br />Only thing that would have been nice is real wasabi, but it's understandable as it doesn't have a long shelf life.<br /><br />I complemented the kit with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/962593460X"">Sushi (Essential Kitchen Series)</a> which was great and I definitely recommend."
"Bought as a gift for a sushi lover, it was perfect. Not only does it come with everything but fish but the recipe book is great. It explains the history along with amazing recipes. It is a great value for the price, would buy it again any day."
bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! i read the reviews before hand and yes we agree the cookbook wasn't that great but everything else was!
"Got this as a gift for my daughter and she was so thrilled to get it. It seems to have everything except the fresh ingredients to make sushi. The recipe book was good, I think once she gets the hang of making the rolls she'll need a better cookbook, but I think it was good for the beginner."
This has everything one needs to make their own sushi.  It is a wonderful kit and contains everything from a roll mat to wasabi paste.  I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to make their own sushi!
"I received this kit for christmas and we just made the sushi tonight and it was fun kit to make simple sushi.  The book could be better, had a watch a few videos on the net to see how to do actually roll the sushi.  You need access to a good asia market to get some of the ingredients, but one you get the correct ingredients you will have some fun making sushi!"
"I love sushi n thought it would be fun to start making it on my own. I looked @ all the other options that specifically came w/ the traditional bamboo roller, n I finally decided to go w/ this one. The packaging is nice n it has everything I need. The recipe book isn't exactly well rounded n has only a few recipes like the California roll, but I was willing to look past it considering there's so many resources out there where I can get what I'm looking for. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to start making sushi in a traditional way."
"This kit was great! The cookbook was very helpful and had great sushi ideas. The items were high quality, I just wish there were more of them. I would recommend it for all who love sushi."
"I bought this kit as a gift for my boyfriend and I'm very pleased. It looks like great quality, worth the price. It's a really unique gift idea. Also, amazon shipped to me in 48 hours, which was an easy transaction."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048II9PI"">Sushi Chef, Sushi Making Kit, 1 EA (Pack of 3)</a>Gave this as a birthday gift for a sushi lover. LOTS of neat ingredients. Great value"
"Great starter kit for beginners. Could've easily had bought higher quality ingredients and tools on my own for less than what the kit costs. The ingredients seem low quality, But it's ok for someone like me who is learning and just starting to make sushi. This kit could be better though."
"I haven't had a chance to use the kit yet since it was a gift for my boyfriend, but the kit was the best deal for everything included. Well worth the purchase and my boyfriend thought it was awesome!"
"This kit really does include everything you need to go from never making sushi to being confident.<br /><br />The book, along with a few youtube videos, are the only training I got in how to make sushi and it has been an enjoyable process.  We have used all the ingredients by now, but still use the mat, spoon and book to refer back to from time to time.<br /><br />Great set"
"Everything you need, except the fresh meat and veg. is included in this kit.  The instruction booklet is helpful,although scantily illustrated.  The ingredients included are of high quality...and the price is right."
Got this for my husband's birthday. He loved it. We only used it once but excited to use it more often.
This was my first time making sushi. I really like this product it came with every thing I needed to make it.Great tasting stuff.I will need more pratice rolling the sushi but every thing that came with the kit was great.I would reccommend this to every one.
"My husband and I had a wonderful day of eating.  First a soup, then after much anticipation California rolls, smoked salmon rolls and shrimp rolls, which ended with a small bowl of mixed fruit.  The Sushi Chef came with everything and the directions were easy to follow.<br /><br />I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  So much so, my friends and I are planning a sushi party."
"This kit is GREAT - all you need to learn how to make sushi (although I did find some good clips on youtube on how to make the rolls) - the rice takes ages to make, you have to wash it three times, cook it, then let it cool (fan it perhaps), then add the rice vinegar or whatever you have to add to it - and it is TOTALLY yummy - and all the other items are great. We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) -  this is a really great kit.  Used up all the nori last night, and will get some more, but this really is all you need to get started.  Couldn't be happier and have recommended it to friends."
Everything you need to get started. You can feel and taste the quality. My only concern is the sushi roll mat. The string seems to be wearing/threading out. I don't expect it to last long.
"It has everything you need for trying your hand at sushi. It helps to have a nice sharp knife. We didn't have a very good sushi knife so it kind of shredded the roll. The seasoned sushi vinegar is great. Now that I have run out, I have to make some seasoned vinegar, which isn't too hard... But it was nice to have it in the one bottle. The nori sheets included don't taste that great, but they are alright to work with. The ""recipe book"" doesn't have a lot of recipes, so I'd recommend looking up your own recipes, or get creative!"
"This kit has everything you need to create your own sushi.  This was our (my husband and I) first attempt.  As long as you allow plenty of time and have plenty of patience, you will have restaurant quality sushi in your own home.  The directions are kind of tricky (which is why I gave 4 starts instead of 5) but you can pretty much get the idea.  Preparing the rice is the hardest part only because it takes about 1.5-2 hours.  I found it easier to work as a team.  I prepared the rice and toasted the nori while my husband cut up the fillers and rolled.  Overall, this is a great way to learning how to make your own sushi.  You have plenty ingredients to use this kit more than once.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try to make their own sushi."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend's parents last year. I included it with some miso soup packages, sesame seeds and a sushi plate set. I really like that it has the bamboo roller as I did a lot of research before making this purchase and read that those are much easier and more efficient for rolling sushi. This package was great and had basically everything, except I wish it included the sesame seeds for what it costs (or used to cost, I see it's about $10 less now). Although it was easy to pick up the seeds at my local grocery store, just an extra trip - which nobody likes.<br /><br />It shipped and arrived very timely and in great condition.<br /><br />I can't review on how well everything works as I haven't heard if they've actually made sushi yet, but it definitely looked nice and was very well received!"
I purchased this product so I could learn how to make sushi rolls.  My daughter was very excited about this product when it was delivered and so the sushi making became a family event.  We had a blast.
This sushi making kit was really fun.  The instructions were just fine and everything we needed (minus the fresh ingredients) were in the box.  The only thing that would have made the kit better would have been an instructional DVD.  The booklet gets kinda messy when you've got sticky rice all over your hands as you're flipping the pages.  So much fun!  And healthy!
"I was very happy when I received this kit. It comes with everything you need to start making sushi and is of very good quality. However, I wish that it would have included more recipes in the booklet and maybe some seasame seeds to go with it. (I can't find seasame seeds anywhere around these parts!) Overall, very pleased with this product."
"The kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit. Makes an awesome gift but I reccomend going to a store and purchasing. When it arrived in the mail, the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere... luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so I was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it. We just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag."
The kit is complete and fun. The only problem is that the rice bag broke in shipping. The package had another seal though so the rice could be recovered and used.
"This Sushi making kit has everything you need if you want to make sushi! And to top that off, it's all great stuff. I got this for my boyfriend and he fell in love with this kit. It's perfect. Definitely a good buy!"
"I got this kit for my college son for Christmas as he and his girlfriend enjoy making meals of all kinds together. It was impossible to find a simple kit locally, and I was very happy with this product. It came sooner than promised, and had just about everything to start making sushi. THe only issue was the handbook was not as clear as it could be for a beginner, so they watched some video's on youtube and as a result, we all enjoyed some awesome sushi for New Years. I may order a kit for myself! Thanks"
This a great starter kit to get you going. It has all the basic tools and items needed to make basic sushi. Check out you tube to learn how to roll and learn some of the recipes. I recommend for someone who has never made sushi before and wants to try.
"My son makes sushi and really wanted a complete set to make sushi for Christmas.  I looked at several and since I don't know anything about making sushi I was a little nervous that I would not get the correct item.  Several of them had plastic parts, etc....however - this one appeared to be good quality so I ordered it.  When he opened this on Christmas morning he could not have been happier. He said ""WOW - this is exactly what I wanted"".....and he was thrilled.  It was a very complete set and nicely packaged."
"This sushi making set is a must have for anyone wanting to learn how to make their own sushi. It comes with all the sushi making essentials, even a mini recipe book (as pictured in product details).  If you enjoy inside out sushi, like california rolls, etc; just use a damp cloth to roll the sushi instead of the bamboo mat. This prevents rice from sticking to everything. It is also useful to keep a small bowl of water and vinegar (included in kit) to dip your hands in to remove rice residue on hands while preparing sushi.  I purchased this product from amazon for just under twenty dollars and it has been worth every penny."
My husband liked his so much that he bought the same thing for a friend! Delivery was super fast as well!
"This item was purchased as a gift for someone who loves the sushi that my wife and I make and I was a little leery at first about a ""kit"" for making sushi.  When it arrived, we were very pleasantly surprised at the quality and completeness of the tools and ingredients.  We were very happy to give this quality gift.  Thank you."
"Love this kit!  It includes everything you need to make basic rolls, and the recipe book includes very basic recipes.  I recommend a supplement like Sushi for Dummies if you're into more creative rolls.  Also check out FineCooking.com for a few basic sushi recipes and step-by-step color photos.  The kit includes the bamboo mat, spatula, two kinds of vinegar, 4 cups of raw rice, 5 sheets of nori, pickled ginger, dark soy sauce, and wasabi powder (for making wasabi paste).  You can probably pick all of these things up in the Asian section of your local grocery store, but you'll definitely save money buying the kit.<br /><br />I wish I had bought this years ago - I love sushi and I now love making my own sushi!  It is so much easier than you would think, and so much cheaper than going out for sushi.  One recommendation - wrap your bamboo mat with plastic wrap if you're going to make inside out rolls!"
"This sushi making set was purchased as a gift.  Although I did not open it myself, it was complete with almost everything needed to make sushi.  The sushi book lacked a little, but I also purchased another sushi book to accompany this set for the receipent.  All in all, it was a nice set and packaged very well."
"I love the kit I can't wait to start experimenting with making sushi! My mother in law got this for me ,a very cool gift!All of the items and spices seem to be good quality stuff too."
"I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my in-laws, it is absolutly wonderful! All that is needed is the fish and or vegetables! I recommend this all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I bought this as a birthday gift.  It is perfect and looks great.  I set the shipping for 1-3 day shipping and it was here the next day.  It is a great gift idea or to keep for yourself.
"I have to agree with some negative reviewers: the ingredients in the kit could be bought for less if you know what you're looking for.  I was given this as a gift long after I had been making sushi on my own.  It's a well done gift... but I already had all the constituent parts.  I'm going to re-gift it when I find someone curious about making sushi and who needs a head-start.  Like I said, it makes a great gift.  Not so great if you're already into sushi making."
"We are reallyt happy with this kit. I purchased an additional sushi book which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're enjoying getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure the professionals do it more efficiently, but there's definitely some fun in preparing this type of cuisine for friends and yourself. Everything's in the box, including a small sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are tricky to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be more extenzive, but for small money, it seems to be a good deal and a lot of fun."
"I bought this for the girl in my life.  She really enjoyed experimenting with it.  I also bought her an additional sushi book  a few months before that but it didnt cover the same things as the manual did., which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're happily getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before. Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for a few bucks, it is still worth it."
This was a second part to a graduation gift. Buying from amazon was a great choice it was cheaper and it arrived faster. Has everything someone needs to make sushi.
It was a gift to someone so I haven't used it but it seems like a good kit.  It had a lot of stuff in it and the shipping was fast.
"My fiance and I are huge sushi fans, we used to go out to sushi at least twice a week and it began to get costly. We started looking at videos on Youtube to find out  products and tools we would need to buy to make our own sushi at home. After compiling the list, I started researching sushi kits.<br />This sushi kit was the most complete kit on the internet, and the price was also the lowest. It includes everything you need to start making basic sushi at home. The only thing you really need to buy is a really sharp sushi knife. The book is really vague and doesn't have many recipes, we just used it to make sushi rice and used Youtube for sushi recipes and rolling techniques. I would definitely recommend this kit to any beginner- you won't be disappointed!!!"
I got this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it! It's a great way to learn how to make sushi and it gives you all the tools you need!
"This is a great sushi making kit.  It has everything you need.  If you are just getting into making your own sushi, then this is the perfect kit to get you going!"
"excellent sushi making kit , i was able to make for a few people. i love it."
"This kit was amazing. It's been so nice to be able to make sushi whenever I'm craving it. The recipe book is easy to follow, and the kit provides all the things you need to make the sushi, including the seaweed.<br /><br />If you like sushi, you will love this sushi making kit."
Unable to review.  Purchased & gave as a gift.  The recipients seemed to like it. I have not been in contact with them since then to know if they have had a chance to try it out.
"I am very pleased with this product. My first attempt with the dry food from ""Candae"" failed even though it was a good brand. My dog is such a picky eater. I gave ""Pure Vita"" (Duck&Oatmeal) a try because it had good reviews. To my surprise and amazement, finally, my dog ate it. I will definitely continue feeding my dog with ""Pure Vita""."
"The product was shipped on time with no problems, I use the mold to make several choc. suckers for halloween. The mold held up well no cracks, I plan to use them again next year."
"Nice, crunchy, three good-sized biscuits to a packet.  I found packages of 15 per for $5.49, but am not permitted by Amazon to give you the whereabouts."
..way OVER priced.  I thought I was getting 15 boxes.  The price was for 1 box.  Thank goodness my Costco started carrying the cranberry/almond version of these again.  I love them!
"Great coffer, but be careful if you use the subscribe and save option, as the price seems the fluctuate.  I have gotten this, and another roast from Camano Island roasters, and have enjoyed them both, but they both had price fluctuations of $10 or so."
"If you love almonds and dark chocolate, this is the treat for you!  Although the company sent me two chocolate almonds and one chocolate walnuts.... instead of the three chocolate almonds as ordered, the products are really good.  This is a healthy treat too.  The company even wrapped them with cooling packs so they would not melt.  i was impressed by those efforts.  A super good and healthy treat!"
"If you've read a bad review for this tea, ignore it! I can't find this tea in stores, but when I find it at hotels I don't drink anything else. It has a delightful but modest fruity/floral flavor from the lotus, and it's really the perfect green tea - for decaf or not. But the bonus really is that it's decaf, if you need a tea to unwind. PERFECTION."
This product is the best by Tazo in my opinion.  Best price and fantastic<br />service by this seller.  Would definitely purchase from them again...<br />g
"This tea scores high on all counts--fragrance, flavor and even the name! Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented. The flavor is augmented by the aroma--a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea. The unusual taste of lotus flower is hard to describe--it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea.<br /><br />If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you. If you want something unusual, savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />Quote from The Book of Tea by Okakura:<br /><br />""Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea.  The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of pines is heard in our kettle.  Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things."""
"This is the first time I have purchased Tazo tea. I have always been a fan of green tea, but this time I decided to purchase green tea with a lotus flavor. I was delighted when my tea finally arrived and I sampled it for the first time. The taste was delicious and I was also very pleased with the delivery of my order. It arrived very quickly. I would recommend this tea to anyone who is a lover of green tea or who loves tea with a very smooth, mellow taste. :)"
This tea is delicious and relaxing.  It is the first tea I choose when I need a soothing moment.  It has the perfect blend of flavor for a calming moment.  I have been buying it for 5 years.
"This decafeinated green tea is good by itself, but a touch of sugar really brings out the fruity taste of the lotus. Mmmm."
"I have been drinking Tazo Lotus tea for a while now, and it is difficult to find in stores.  Thank you for carrying it on Amazon.com"
"This is a great product.  I was glad I could order it because I can't find it in any stores.  I actually had the opportunity to try it when I purchased a variety pack of Tazo teas.  For any avid tea drinker, especially someone who likes green tea, I would highly recommend this.  I also like the fact it's decaf."
The tea is great but the shipping was nearly twice the price of the tea.
I bought this brand since I have 2 beauty's a Persian White show cat and a Persian Tortishell show cat. They are beautiful cats.<br />They love there food. The last bag I purchased was for fussy cats. They loved it. This time I had seen Royal Cnin Feline Health Indoor Beauty 35. I brought it home and those two cats love it. It keeps them full and happy. They do not eat that much at a time. I like all of the Royal Canin Cat food.<br />I'm impressed.
"We have a five year old Egyptian Mau cat who is quite picky when it comes to dry food...she will not eat any of those ""grocery store"" brands (9 Lives, Friskies, etc.), she hates Iams & Eukanuba, will not touch Science Diet, etc.  Our veterinarian (we go to a ""cat only"" vet who specializes in purebred kitties) recommended Royal Canin food.  Since our Mau LOVES to shed...I decided to try this particular type of Royal Canin (since they don't have a Mau specific food).  Instantly she pounced on her automatic dry feeder...and absolutely loves it! Royal Canin costs more than most cat foods but it's worth it!"
"Panch Phoron is a Bengali melange of five spices, combining for a wonderful mix of tastes. It's sometimes hard to find in the U.S., and when you do find it, some brands substitute cheaper seeds instead of the correct five spices. This brand is a good one and I would be completely satisfied if it weren't so expensive."
A special mix of spices - can't find them here in my neck of the woods. Should last me awhile!
"I got these in the mail today, my dogs LOVE them! They are small enough to be used as training treats. I put them in my Shih Tzu's IQ treat ball, they roll it all over the house trying to get them out =) I would recommend these to anyone whether they have small or large dogs =)"
"We love all of the Charlee bear dog treats, but I think this is the new favorite flavor. My pups try every trick they know to get these!. They are small, so I don't feel bad applying them liberally to a training problem. Overall great product, and Thanksgiving festive to boot!"
"You can teach a dog anything with Charlee Bears.  We're well beyond the sit, high five, and shake -- we've graduated to 'beer me'."
"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."
It's hard to find small inexpensive treats. These are perfect for my little dogs. They can have frequent treats without getting too much.
Great for training because they're low calorie so you can give more. My Maltese loves them and they're good and crunchy.
Our Great Dane loves these treats.  We use these in our training sessions and she never seems to get tired of them.  They are small and don't make a greasy mess so we can always keep them in a pocket so they are handy.
"Our dogs love love love Charlee Bears and know them by name. All we have to do is say, ""Do you want a Charlee Bear?"" and they come running.  They seem to love all of the flavors without preference for one over the other."
"Nice little treats.  Afterall, it's not the size of the reward, it's the reward.  This way, she gets a few more and less calories."
Our dogs love these treats and Petsmart is a long way from our house and we are glad they are online at Amazon.  The product is great and we will keep buying and the service is perfect.
"We did a taste comparison, laying out a whole array of different kinds of treats - these were the ""go to"" ones.  They are conveniently sized and don't crumble in your pocket, so they are great for taking along..."
"My schnauzer knows what it means when I say ""Do you want Charlee?"".  I use them as treats, and also for the 'put a treat on their nose, and have them catch it in their mouth' trick.  She is on medication for heart failure, and per info from the company, the sodium content in these is such that the vet said they'd be OK (otherwise, my dog is on a prescription diet, and has freeze dried peas meant for toddlers as treats).  I'll be buying these as long as my dog is alive :)"
He loves it when we put them in the ball and he chases it and picks it up and gets a treat when he drops is.  Unfortunately the liver made him very sick to the stomach.  The others with cranberry are his favorites.
I use these for training and my dogs absolutely love them.  As others mentioned they look plain and have have basically no smell to them but my dogs enjoy them well enough to use as a reward for training.
"My female Aussie has problems with UTIs. I started using these treats in the hopes that the cranberry would help prevent the UTIs. She has not had one since. Also, she loves them and they are low in calorie. Great product."
"My dog loves these little treats - only 3 calories each and that adds up when you use them for training.  I keep several in the pockets of my jackets so when we go for walks we can work on our commands, and I use them to calm her down by saying ""watch me"" when another dog comes by. She is generously rewarded with Charlee Dogs.<br /><br />I've had a hard time finding this product in pet stores and I've bought other brands. They seem a little harder and larger, not great for training unless it's a mastiff or something. Don't get me wrong, these are wonderful little treats anytime for my dog."
"Petsmart sent me a free sample with an order I placed with them for something else. Long story short, I was interested in seeing if my dog would even like them cause there so low in calories. I have a maltipoo and although he prefers Dingo treats, he lows these Turkey Liver & Cranberries dog treats! For some reason I just assumed he wouldn't like them, but boy was I wrong. Will probably place an order soon via Amazon (Prime, of course)."
"These treats are awesome!  They are healthy and low in calories, so you can use it for training.  However, they are bigger than just 'bite size.'  They seem to be good for my dogs with sensitive stomachs also.  And the price is good too!"
My older dog is picky and she love these treats and I can give her quite a few with out felling like I am overindulging her. My younger dogs gets these in the Kong's and other treat dispensing toys and loves them as well.
I have a 5# chihuahua and he loves these treats. He plays with them first and then eats them. I have had to limit his daily intake or he would have eaten the whole bag. Big plus for this product.
I bought three bags (variety) of this treat.  It had no smell.  My dog would not eat any of them.  It obviously had no taste either.
My dog was not as crazy about this product as I thought she might be.  They are a healthy treat that she will eat after she knows she isn't getting anything else.
"We had three black labs when I lived up in Wisconsin, and they all went wild for these, preferring the original and the cranberry over the other flavors.  All we had to do was say ""bears"" and their ears perked up as they did a little dance.  My beagle, on the other hand, is picky and wouldn't eat them.  Guess it's a matter of taste.  That's no reason to give this product a low rating, because it all comes down to the dog.  They are clean, don't smell, and they look a bit like oyster crackers.  In fact, sometimes we put them in with a new dog food to get the boys to eat it, and it worked.  If you're not sure your dog will go for them, try the smaller packs first."
I have nothing against the product as I know other people whose dogs eat them but for whatever reason my dog would not touch them. She can be picky at times but the treats that she likes she never turns down. I bought two bags in different flavors and wound up giving them to my sister for her dogs.
"Our two pomeranians will not eat them - - guess they have too many choices, nothing is wrong with them - packaged nicely, fast shipping."
My Melodica from Amazon<br /><br />Thank you for the wonderful service.I look forward to many years of enjoyment!Just what I was looking for.
"After a while, she could take or leave this.  They did not work well for training treats as she was not crazy about them."
"Why is there no indication of weight for this? It is interesting that all others are clearly indicated as 16 oz, but this package photo actually has the weight obscured by loose Charlie Bears.  I suspect this is smaller than the other packages at $5.99 which are 16 oz."
Great tasting but does require more stirring to dissolve. Made in Germany so the company adheres to the European Organic regulations which ensures that there is no hidden MSG added which is an issue with many USA organic products.
very flimsy and lots broke upon opening.  not very big. some what disappointedwith these flossies!! Last time they weregreat and lasted
"I get these regularly for my 2 small dogs (maltipoo and pomston) for long car rides.  It keeps them happy and busy - which is important because one of them tends to get car sick if she's not occupied.  They love them - but I have to take them away when there is only an inch or so left.  My maltipoo choked on a small piece and it was very scary.  Now I just keep an eye out when they get to around an inch and they get taken away.<br /><br />I don't know why, but the prices on these doubled in the last few months.  I'm starting to limit how many they can have.  I have noticed their breath isn't as clean since I've cut back.  They must have really helped keep their teeth clean!"
It's not easy to satisfy my dog and keep him busy at the same time.  I only look for products that are relatively healthy. These flossies hit the mark.
These are awesome. When I need quiet time. They work like magic.  It like a pacifier for dogs!!!  Great deal and quick delivery.
"My Shih Tzu has enjoyed these treats for years.  I used to give them 5 starts.  But then the company started having inventory problems.  Sometimes it would take 2-3 months unless you were willing to pat $250 a box.  Now they've fixed the inventory issues but have totally screwed up the packaging.  Where they used to just place a cardboard strip in the middle of the treat, now they shrink-wrap it in very tough plastic.  You have to fight with it for 5 minutes just to get the darned thing unwrapped.  And they've gone backwards environmentally speaking.  All of the packaging used to be recyclable but now it goes in a landfill.  I've just had it.  My puppy prefers your chews, but I think it's going to be Best Bully Sticks from now on."
my dogs love these treats. recommend supervision especially for small dogs.<br />I get stares every day as they smell them in the pantry. They cant get enough!
I was very happy to find this item at Amazon. The pet shops around here (north of Boston) don't seem<br />to be able get them lately. This is my dog's favorite chew treat. The flossies I received were on the<br />thin side. The ones at the pet shop from the same company were more substantial. I hope in the future<br />they are more substantial.
"My vet has these for sale individually and recommends them to control tartar on our dog's teeth. The mildly abrasive action while he happily gnaws away is especially helpful to his back teeth. We have tried other brands, but this one holds up better to his chewing and it is the same brand his breeder uses."
"I've given both of my puppies look-alike and similar products and these are by far the best.  I have never met a dog that does not LOVE these! I've given them to friends and they can't believe how much more their dogs love these compared to what they had previously thought were their dogs' ""favorite"" chews. I call these my puppy baby sitters because they are miraculous at occupying my puppy and satisfying his chewing needs.  I have a small breed puppy and they are the perfect size and shape for him to hold and chew (not too bulky/big).  These can be difficult to come by (I've only found them at specialty pet stores) and are relatively expensive, so it is definitely worth it to order them in bulk from Amazon - you'll save time and money."
"about these dog chews/treats. they keep my dog busy for hours and get her need to chew out on something meant for a dog and not one of our shoes, furniture, etc.  I wish they were a bit cheaper because My dog goes through 1 a day!!!<br />Fantastic, quality product."
"My pug just loves these!  And when my daughter's dogs vacationed here, I had to buy enough for all.  There are very few products for pets that they like, but this is definitely one!"
"These were too big for my pug when he was a puppy, but now he loves them and finishes one per night. We've nicknamed them the ""stinky beefs"" since the smell isn't great. I like that it's not a corn- or grain-based treat."
I received these flossies and they were full of mold and definitely not suitable for consumption.  There was a recall by the manufacturer some time ago and flossies are hard to get a hold of.  Either these were recalled and the seller is still selling them or the seller is storing these in bad conditions.  It took more then a month to deal with the seller to finally get a shipping label and full refund.  Buy with caution.
"These were priced right so to be frank, my expectations were a bit low. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when a delightfully packed box (appropriate for gift giving) was delivered with six different varieties of dried mushrooms, presentation stuffing, recipe ideas etc...the overall effect is quite nice and makes a wonderful gift idea.<br /><br />The first we tried were the morels - although you can certainly find much more expensive ones, I was very pleasantly surprised how good these were especially given the price of the entire box. Frankly, they tasted much better than expected. Next were the shiitake which are one of my favorite mushrooms and I tend to be very picky about them...most of the time I purchase them fresh but always keep some dried on hand for those ""cooking emergencies"" (I use a lot of shrooms when cooking). In fact, I had just ordered a pound of dried shiitake from another vendor...these were FAR surperior (unfortunately, I'm stuck with a pound of not so good ones...USA organic made at that!). Each has been equally pleasant and far in excess of my (admittedly modest) expectations. Frankly, these would easily pass for double the cost I paid...in fact, I liked this set so much, I hesitated to give it such a good rating because I was afraid they would jump the price up!<br /><br />As soon as I work through my present selection from the other inferior company, I intend to purchase more dried and fresh mushrooms from this Earthy. VERY impressed!"
"I haven't yet tried the morels which are of course the gems of the litter, but of the three other varieties I've tried, these are great!  An ounce is quite a lot actually...I'm going to get 2-3 uses out of each bag.<br /><br />I've never rehydrated mushrooms before but it's pretty easy and has some great benefits.  While the texture isn't the same as cooking with fresh mushrooms it lets you have all these varieties any time of the year and the ""liquor"" that you get from the water they rehydrate in is flavorful and great for using in sauces (sometimes the same recipe as the mushrooms).<br /><br />One caveat though - I had looked up instructions online and then compared them with the labels.  I followed the instructions on the labels at first but found one important thing that the internet had suggested - you really do need to carefully wash these and strain the liquor if you're going to use it.  That's because there IS sand and grit on a few of the mushrooms.  (Overall they seem fairly clean, but I bit into a few grains of sand the first few times I used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  My palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />Finally, I did separately order a variety of other products from Earthy direct from their website.  They have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  Watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on Amazon.<br /><br />Customer service from Earthy is great as well...I would assume they'd treat Amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  I had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it."
Love this sample pack a lot of wild mushrooms of all varieties.....love the morels and oyster mushrooms in my stuffing thanks
"I used to get dried mushrooms from Costco, I thought they were the best until I tried these. Costco no longer sells them so I had to try something new, and I was not dissapointed at all! I am so glad Costco doesnt carry them anymore, otherwise I would not have tried these. They are terrific!"
"Morel mushroom package contains only half of what the product description claims with 0.5 ounces; moreover, the Melange de La Foret mushrooms are not included and replaced with cheaper Oyster mushrooms.  NOT worth the money considering these factors, in my opinion."
"There were to be 6 dried samples of different types of mushrooms, but instead of the Melange de la Foret shown in the ad, which was wanted, there was a bag of Oyster mushrooms, which wasn't.  No communication from Amazon or Earthy Delights saying there was a substitution - even the shipment list was correct for what was ordered and advertised.  Wonder how careful these folks are about other things...."
"*****<br />This Green Tea from Yogi Tea is a plain, but far from ordinary green tea. The taste is incredible. It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants. It contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee). Note that Yogi makes a Decaf Simply Green Tea, too, if you want to avoid the caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended. In the case of this tea, simplicity is bliss!<br />*****"
You won't find any better chocolate for this price. This is by far my favorite chocolate. It's free from unnecessary additives and it just amazingly good.
"the dog loves choo hooves, but often some of them can be odor offensive while she is chewing them.  she also loves to bring one to bed with us, so sometimes that requires the fan to be on in order to send the odor on out the door so as not to linger.  NOT ANY MORE, these smoked hooves are great.  not only does the dog love them more, but they truly smell like a smoldering campfire.  so i watch tv, she chews and i imagine the warmth of a nice smokey fire close by.  no more fans as i LOVE a good campfire.  ooooppppsss... now the neighbor dog is hooked too!!  sharing in the neighborhood.  going to order 3 more bags.  the 'humane society no kill shelter' will love these for the pups on the hill."
I love Red barn products but their hooves are very hard and if your dog doesn't want to take the time to chew them down the dog can break these up into 5 or 6 pieces and than swallow these jagged hard pieces.  Mine did this and the next day was vey sick trying to bring those sharp pieces back up.  I feel he could have been very hurt if they moved further into his intestines. I was worried enough to consider giving pumpkin mash to help coat any piece that didn't come back up the next day to help it through smoother.<br />My dog is bigger and these hooves are smaller so maybe a little dog would be okay with them but not if they are piggish little dogs!
"I love these cookies! They remind me of the oatmeal cookies I ate as a kid. I love the fact that they have coconut in them. They aren't too sweet, they're crunchy, the way I like my oatmeal cookies. Three of these with a cup of coffee as a snack is just perfect! I had heard that the manufacturer (in Australia) was going under, but another investor bought it at the last minute. I'm hoping these will continue to be made and sold in the US. I like that a percentage of the proceeds benefits veterans!"
"my daughter loves drinking this milk, but I cannot find the 8oz anywhere in choclate. since the school doesn't carry this type of milk. The 8oz is perfect for her to take to school. Can you please offer the 8oz in choclate also."
"I used this product for many years. I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. The chocolate flavor of this drink is terrific- sweet and chocolaty, totally delicious, and I drank this every day for decades.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

I have been drinking this stuff for years as I cannot tolerate cow's milk. It is good stuff. And now Amazon just reduced it to an excellent price and even better with subscribe and save. Excellent chocolate rice milk.
"One of my favorite teas from Teavana. It's smooth and fruity, NATURALLY sweet, and just enough flavor in every cup. HIGHLY recommend"
"I just spent a small fortune on four different types of this tea. Along with the pitcher and tins. I just went on Amazon and saw that it was a fraction of the cost I paid for. But I must say this tea is outstanding, in taste and a little goes a long way. I will most definitely purchase it through Amazon and not at the actual store. Wish I had done some research before spending lots of money on these products."
"This is one of my husband's favorite teas.  I wish it weren't so expensive, but it does last a long time.  I bought an 8 ounce bag and received 4 separate 2 ounce bags, which is quite a waste of packaging."
The order arrived in fine shape but the quelity of the vranberry sauce was watery and runny in every one we tried - we finally threw them away afraid we would get sick
"I remember eating this candy when I was a little girl, and it was nice to go back to childhood for a little while! Lol"
i have everything i need to grow and indoor flower for my girlfriend. we grew some similar flowers last year but I know she will especially love this one since it is pink.
"This bread is ok but it lakes something. Its ok as toast.it doesnt make a good sadwitch. I dont know what elnce to say,ive said as much as I can say.."
"I don't like green olives, but these are delicious! The insertion of lemon truly makes these taste different. They are great for a party or just to nibble on alone. I will be purchasing them again and again!"
Bought 3 jars of olives cause they were cheaper than The other brand I had enjoyed.<br />My buddy and I agree there was no lemon taste at all and tasted same as normal olives with pimento.<br />Don't waste your money.
OMG these are the best olives ever! A little expensive but worth it. The lemon is very subtle. Even my kids like them!
"These are the best bottled olives I've ever had, and I've loved green olives since I was a child (during the Buchanan Administration)."
"My first impression was negative. But, I only had one glass and it was a little cool when it came up from the cellar. After being open for a day (re-corked)I guess it had time to breath. It did improve.<br />I wouldn't rush out and buy a case but for around $11 at Costco I would buy it again."
"I have an intense dislike for all fake sugars out there, and have tried every one I could get my hands on. Ideal Sweetener is the only one I like. It is perfect for baking and you use it cup-for-cup in recipes instead of sugar. Zero calories and has no funky aftertaste like most artificial sweeteners. I am so happy I will be able to order this on Amazon in the Baking Bag, as all the stores in my area only carry the small packs. Finally, I can make cookies and breads without all the calories!!<br /><br />EDIT: If you are using this for baking, it is not zero calories. I contacted Heartland Sweeteners to find out the calories-per-cup, and this was the response:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Heartland Sweeteners.  The FDA allows any food item with less than 5 calories per serving to be labeled as ""zero calories"". Ideal has 202 calories per cup versus over 770 calories in a cup of sugar."
"I have been using sugar alternatives for many years. I have tried many of them. I loved Splenda(sucralose), but recently discovered that it is not properly digestible, with as much as 40% left for the body to process. I went back to stevia based sweeteners, but quickly grew tired of the bitter after taste. This product is also based in  plant-like, natural ingredients. The taste closely rivals table sugar! I am already on my second large order. I add it to my coffee and iced tea with a teaspoon just as if it was sugar."
"I like this sweetener a lot.  But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal.  So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon.  So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says.  They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag!  The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose.  It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.<br /><br />Rating breakdown:<br />Product claims = 1 star<br />Product taste = 5 stars<br />Overall: 3 stars<br /><br />Calorie and carb info from [...]"
"I was very disappointed in this item, which I thought would be 100% xylitol. It is a mixture of xylitol and SUCRALOSE (splenda). I would never have bought this dangerous sweetener, so I am pretty bummed I wasted my $$$."
"Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods."
I am so glad I found a place to purchase this product.  I really like Ideal.  I use it in my iced tea and it tastes like sugar.  It works really well with hot tea too.
"I have a problem with many reviews calling this a ""healthy"" sweetener for it is NOT healthy, just a better substitute than many others out there. Although not a ""healthy"" sweetener, it taste great and taste pretty much just like the organic Sucant sugar I usually use for baking.<br /><br />The first ingredient in Ideal is Xylitol (not very sweet by itself) which is iffy with health foodies (they say it is too processed just like white sugar) and then Ideal adds two other ingredients that are definitely unhealthy. Maltrodextrin is more often than not derived from corn (usually GMO corn) which is NOT healthy and the other ingredient is Sucralose which is Splenda which is NOT healthy because your body cant recognize it and doesnt know what to do with it therefore making it harder on your system than sugar and harder to digest.<br /><br />I'm huge into whole food holistic eating and buy stevia leaves or stevia powder which is truly zero calories and not bad on your system; yet, it does have a minor aftertaste you have to get used to. If you are looking for a sweetener that is not unhealthy turn to 100% stevia and is fine for diabetics. Again, this Ideal brand xylitol is mixed with corn sweetener and splenda and although not healthy, does taste great!"
"This is probably one of the best brand of sweetener available right now.  There are many sweeteners at supermarkets & grocery stores: like Equal, Splenda, Truvia, Purevia, etc...  But Ideal is my favorite for two reasons: Taste & Consistency.<br /><br />Taste: It's the closest thing you will get to sugar without being sugar.  In ""my opinion"", it ALMOST leaves none of the aftertaste that you come to expect from sweeteners like Sweet-N-Low (saccharin), Nutrasweet (aspartame), or to an extent Splenda (sucralose). Truvia & Purevia do taste like sugar initially, but I find they have a bitter aftertaste.  Ideal (xylitol) has a slight hint of non-sugar initially, that eventually subside and disappear.<br /><br />Consistency: It looks like sugar!! It is not powdery or too off-white or too dark. It's crystally like sugar. Actually, you could mistake it with real sugar by just the look of it.  The only thing that gives it away is the feel of it on your spoon or your hand.  It feels lighter than real sugar, almost fluffy (light 'n airy).<br /><br />One of the best thing about Ideal is it dissolves equally well in hot AND cold beverages, unlike real sugar.  I have not tried it for baking or sweet recipes, but have added to savory dishes and it is a worthy substitute.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with Ideal is you can't find it at many grocery stores or supermarket.  You need to order it on Amazon or look on their website where they get distributed.<br /><br />Overall, A++"
"I've been able to use this sweetener in my recipes and things like coffee, tea, etc. It tastes like sugar - no bitterness or aftertaste. However, I find the ""zero calorie"" label misleading. They're allowed to say that the product has zero calories because each teaspoon has less than five, which is close enough for the FDA. However, if you're going to use it in baking, you will be adding some calories and carbohydrates. Each cup has 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs, according to their website. I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than sugar, but I think the packaging should give the statistics per cup instead of the rounded down ""zeros"" in a teaspoon."
"I have purchased Ideal for about a year now but discovered that the product sold in the store was promotional and the big chains here in Massachusetts are not selling it.  Major Bummer.  I sent the Ideal folks an e-mail about the situation--they were the ones who told me about the distribution problems.<br /><br />Ideal contains as the first ingredient, Xylitol which is found in sugarless gum.  Xylitol has the benefit of being dentally positive (it actually promotes to a degree some dental benefits) whereas sugar as we all know is dentally negative (sugar is food for bacteria and the bacteria byproducts, poo as it is, causes dental caries).  That is the reason I use it. One only needs to calculate the cost of dental bills to decide to add Ideal to one's shopping list-- along with floss and fluoride rinse.<br /><br />I find the taste of Ideal to be better than sugar as there is no post sugar dryness in the mouth.  The pink, blue yellow and other fake sweetners have a horrible aftertaste which Ideal does not have (at least in coffee and ice tea). The only bummer is that the Ideal company is not doing a better job of promoting this product.  But such is life.<br /><br />I do agree with some writers that the Ideal folks should be upfront about calories.  Sadly the Ideal folks are following the letter of the law that allows companies to say no calorie when in fact there are calories.  The oil in the can spray products are a big offender here as they list their serving size to be 1/3 of a second but if one calculates the amount of fat calories in a small can it comes to about 1400 calories, all from fat.  Ideal should not take this route and should be upfront.  5 calories per teaspoon with diabetic and dental benefits is, in my book, a positive selling point."
"This product has a slightly chemical flavor and a texture that is almost flaked.  I was disappointed that it does not melt, like the Now brand."
"This is a great sugar alternative to use for cookies, however, I was unsuccessful when I used it to make a cake. The cookies turn out exactly like cookies made with real sugar and you cannot taste a difference. The cake turned out heavy and it got heavier with each day after it was made."
"WOW - FINALLY!  I have my own specialty baking business - offering wholesome whole grain cookies and breads - after many requests for lower sugar content, from ""anti-splenda"" folks, I found IDEAL...LOVE it and am so excited to try the BROWN sugar version too... the POWDERED sugar version is good too - slightly different taste in frosting than reg. powdered sugar - suggest half and half... but NOT bitter at all... THANKS Hearland Sweeteners!"
"Taste wise, Ideal is awesome BUT......... It contains sucralose AKA Spelnda.<br /><br />it's unnecessary to add it in. Xylitol is already a sweetener<br /><br />Get <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6852"">Now Foods</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5T52"">Emerald forest</a> instead. At least you're gettting 100% all Xylitol"
"I use this to bake with and it tastes as good as sugar. No aftertaste or anything. I feel better that I am eating less sugar, and this is supposed to be better for you that other sugar substitutes."
"I am so glad to find Ideal sugar substitute. It is Xylitol, not a dangerous chemical. It tastes just like sugar. I understand that you can bake with it, but I haven't done that yet."
"This product is fantastic. Not quite as sweet as sugar so I add a tad of Truvia to it. And Ideal's powdered sugar is the best!!!<br /><br />The last 'source' provided this for $5.99 to $6.49(which I bought regularly from Amazon). When it went up to $8.99 I went to the Ideal website and found that a number of local groceries are carrying it now.  I found it at Frys, it's also available at Fred Meyers, any grocers that sell Kroger products & a few stores - for $4.99!"
no after taste ... i use it in  coffee tea oatmeal popcorn with a bit of salt or what i deem that needs to be sweeten my kids don't notice any difference between IDEAL and SUGAR .. oh yeah i tried stevia (it's ok  and i had a after taste using it..i will be buying IDEAL  again from amazon.
"I ordered this Stuff just for funsies and thought I'd died and went to sugar heaven. I ate it almost exclusively on Oatmeal this whole winter I loved the crunch of it on my steaming hot morning meal.  I actually wimpered when I used the last of it. I'd kill for a couple of bags now that it's berry season.  I can't waste it on hot or cold tea, food that needs that crunchy sweet bite is what I'd save it for.  I even asked Splenda when they were going to get with it and make a crunchy formula, and they acted like I was from Mars. Just one lil question, when are ya gonna be in stores?? Whine whine whine! Lol, just kiddn but I can't use my credit card too much but I'd gladly buy this stuff by the armload in my own grocery store. Please get in stores in the south when youse guys can!! I will buy it like crazy!"
"this is a wonderful product. it is sweet and no aftertaste. i don't mind an aftertaste to save calories but my mother is always bothered by it so doesn't like to eat the things i make if i make it with sucralose. i made a cake and some cookies and she thought they were made with sugar. so it passes her test :).<br /><br />two things i don't like about it is the ""zero calorie"" thing. it has about two hundred calories per cup so is misleading. basically all things that claim no calories are like this so they aren't the only ones but i still think it's false advertising.<br /><br />the other thing is that you only get four cups. sugar where i live costs less than half of this for a five pound bag. i have no problem spending money but buying this all the time would run anyone dry pretty quickly. i'll buy it again if it's on sale again but won't be a regular.<br /><br />anyone wanting to try this i suggest you do. it almost acts just like sugar. it just doesn't give as much volume as sugar does in recipes."
"IDEAL No Calorie Sweetener is ..fantastic.  Have been  using it exclusively in pie baking.  Even though it says use in same amount as you would sugar, we find about a quarter more is needed to achieve the same sweetness.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie, fruit pies, even the filling for cream puffs.  You can't tell the difference and ""sugar only"" lovers do not have a word of complaint.<br /><br />Have not tried the brown or confectioners sweeteners yet, but will soon and expect them to be just as satisfactory.<br /><br />Delicious Cranberry Sauce:  One bag whole cranberries, one cup diet cola, one and a quarter cups Ideal and some grated orange peel.  Cook to boiling, simmer about half hour and set aside to cool.  Refrigerate overnight and enjoy the next day.Thickens up nicely and is really really good.<br /><br />Amazon is best place to find this, I bought 6 large bags last time as I never want to be without it in the house."
"if you need or want a sugar substitute, this is by far the best tasting one, and that is what really matters.  Splenda can be too sweet, especially in tea and sprinkling matters.  Others have that funky after taste, like stevia does.  I hae baked with it and though it doesn't rise as well as sugar does it is better than the splenda does.  Xylitol has good dental reviews too.  And Ideal is a 99.95 % natural product and is common in many foods and natural items. I love it and Ive tried most of the products out there.  I buy it here on amazon becasue the one I can get at the local is more $$ and they don't have the brown or confectionary.  Can't wait to work with those too."
"I am diabetic and I have tried all of the sugar substitutes and there is nothing out there that compares to IDEAL. I use Ideal every single day. There is absolutely no other product that even comes close to IDEAL. I have recommended this to all of my friends, diabetic and non-diabetic. No after taste, great flavor, ease of use and highly recommended. I honestly love this product. Some have said that the price is a little high but I think that it is worth every single penny. Thank you makers of IDEAL. Time to retire the rest because IDEAL is the BEST!"
This is the best no calorie sweetner I have ever used.  I have tried most of the national brands and nothing can comare to Ideal No Calorie Sweetner.  My entire family uses it the kids cannot tell the difference between Ideal and sugar.  My daughter-in-law is a type 1 diabetic and she uses it all the time for her family.  I cannot say enough great things about this product.
"Ideal sugar substitute is the best product out there. I love Truvia but $7.49 for that little jar is ridiculous and there's less carbs in Ideal.It tastes great in coffee too. As I do the ""HCG Diet Protocol"" regularly throughout the year, Ideal gets me through!"
When I ordered these sweeteners I thought they were sweetened with zylitol only. That is what I was looking for. But when I got it I found out they also contained sucralose. which they did not mention. So I was not really happy with it
"I've been trying to quit sugar.  I tried every product out there.  Ideal is the only sugar substitute that really tastes like sugar.  I know other brands make this claim, but this product really does.  It's healthy too.  Made from birch, not corn.  You measure it just like sugar.  It's that simple.<br />I wish it was easier to find in stores.  I'm buying five bags at a time to save on shipping."
"I really like xylitol. It has a nice, clean taste that's very close to sugar and doesn't seem to upset my stomach. Recommended."
I have recently been doing some research about sugar substitutes and this is a product that was recommended by bodybuilding.com.  So I thought I would give it a try.  This is a great product. Not as sweet as other sugar substitutes. Great product! Will definately continue to buy!
"Ideal sweetener is the best sugar substitute I've found.  I even use it for canning, such as making sweet pickles, a light syrup for peaches, etc.  I've tried Splenda, but didn't like it as well, and got poor results in baking.  When I use Ideal for baking, the results are much improved.  One little hint:  Use Ideal in place of regular sugar, but also add a small amount of real sugar to the Ideal portion (say 1 Tbsp of sugar on top of 1 cup of Ideal) to get a better consistency in your baked goods.  The only problem I have found with this product is availability.  Our local grocery stores sell all kinds of Splenda, but have discontinued selling Ideal.  I wonder why.  Now I am forced to buy online.  Amazon's price has more than doubled since I bought it two months ago, so what's up with that???"
I love this product and will reorder when needed.  However...one of the bags of sugar was ripped and sugar was everywhere!  Whoever packed this was not paying attention!
This is my second order for this stuff.  It's great and cheaper than those single serve bags.<br /><br />Need to put these on my auto-order!
Best stuff on the planet. I never use anything else for my coffee anymore. Wish this would be more popular since I think it tastes better than sugar.
I can't add anything else that hasn't already been said here.  This blows all the other sweetners out of the water.  NO SWEETNER AFTERTASTE!  It would be great if they came up with a syrup version so I can stop using my aspartame based syrup.
"I am an older man , and many times my blood sugar levels have touched upon the outer edges of diabetes.  Therefore, I have tried to avoid actual white sugar with sugar substitutes.  Believe me I have tried them all!  Then one day a concerned ""Health Nut"" friend of mine gave me a bag of Ideal and I "" fell in love!""  This is the absolute best-tasting, healthiest stuff and my sugar substitute for life!"
This works great!  I use it to make Kool-Aid and only use 3/4 of a cup vs. 1 cup of sugar and there isn't any difference in taste.  Definitely something for those with diabetes.
"This is the very best no calorie sweetener that I have found. Ideal is perfect for cooking, baking, and all other uses that usually require sugar. As a diabetic, this is the best product that I have found, and at a great price!"
"I have tried several different products for baking, but give Ideal No Calorie Sweetener the highest rating of them all.  1) Measures like sugar; 2) no after taste; 3) does not affect the moisture of the final baked product; 4) my husband and family can't tell the difference!"
"I've tried all the sugar substitutes on the market and this is the only one I will use.  Unlike the others, it tastes like sugar and has little to no after taste."
"Love love love Ideal and I was hoping that this being Amazon and all that the price would be comparable to getting it at the one local store here that carried it, but imagine my shock when it's double the cost here online for a baking bag :::sigh:::"
"Tastes like sugar, bakes like sugar. Fast shipping, happy with the whole order process.  Matches sugar cup for cup and has a great taste, no bitterness like other sweeteners. Great stuff!"
"Love this product and also Ideal Brown No-Calorie Sweetner.  It bakes well and doesn't lose it's sweetness.  Worked fabulous with date-nut pumpkin bread and pie-crust cinnamon rolls, no change in texture.  Oatmeal, peanut-butter & sugar cookies are good, although still denser then regular cookies of same variety."
"Ideal is a must try sweetener for those who rely on artificial sweeteners. It contains the same sweetening ingredient as sugar-free gum (xylitol) and is absolutely the best I've tried as far as imitating sugar. There is no after taste! It comes in a granulated, powdered and brown sugar version. The best!<br /><br />Warning: this product can be very hazardous to pets! The package is labelled as such (it states along with chocolate,grapes etc.) so be very careful not to leave it out where they can get at it. Their digestive system does not handle the enzymes the same way as humans."
"I'm prediabetic so I've reviewed plenty of sugar substitues and this one is the best, hands down. It's 99% all natural, measures just like sugar and doesn't have the artificial aftertaste like all the others on the market. What more could you ask for?"
"I have used xylitol for many years, and it is my favorite dry alternative to sugar. It is great for sweetening beverages, and can be used in some baking situations. Although, I will say this: sugar not only caramelizes (which makes cookies yummy) but it lends moisture to baked goods (which helps muffins and cakes be yummy). If you intend to use these things in baking, please keep these things in mind and adjust recipes accordingly. A cookie with all xylitol in it won't caramelize, and cakey things with all xylitol may end up dry and crumbly (depending on other ingredients). Hope this helps!"
"So it has sucrolose in it. So what? It tastes great and is a lot better for you then sugar. It fights tooth decay as opposed to sugar which causes it. Ideal has no vile after taste. Closest taste to sugar, and will make a diet easier to follow. If i used splenda i would go back to sugar, if i used stevia i would be broke, if i used sweet n low or equal i would vomit. Ideal is not better then sugar but it is a great substitute and will keep those insane amounts of sugar out of your diet if you drink your coffee like i do. I bought a bag today and i'm gonna clean out my sugar shaker and fill it with ideal."
Have tried ideal in several different reciepes and have mostly good results. There is no after taste and doesn't seem overly sweet.  I have my husband using it in his coffee regularly instead of sugar.  I also have shared with both of my adult children and they are both hooked on using it also.
Great product' matches surgar cup for cup.  Does not leave bitter after-taste.  Tried all others and this is the best.
"Being a diabetic and a carbs addict I don't need the sugar or starches, so Idea is a good brand sweetner for me. I have tried splenda, Diabeti Sweet, Sugar Twin, Sweet and Low, Equal, and saccharin, and I few others over the last few years. Idea sweetner at the top of the list!!!"
The best sweetner I have ever tried. Good for baking and you can also get it in brown and confectioners as well.
"I have been extremely satisfied with the quality of Ideal brand white and brown sugar. I have used both the white and brown sugar in everything including drink mixes, syrups, cakes, pies and caramels and couldn't be happier. The taste is fantastic and is indistinguishable from the real thing in cooking and baking! No one has even questioned the taste of drinks and foods I have prepared with it. I only wish Ideal sold larger bags of their sugar products!  Ideal sugars do not leave any strange after taste and are a welcome alternative to other ""faux"" sugar products available on the market.  Best of all...they have NO CALORIES!!!"
"I started using Splenda several years ago and was happy to find a sugar substitute that didn't leave an aftertaste.  Then I started doing research last year after hearing negative things about long term use of some of the chemicals in Splenda.  I found Ideal in the process and gave it a try.  I like the taste of it over Splenda and so far the scientist haven't found any bad things about it.....yet.  If you want to know how Ideal tastes just chew a stick of sugar free gum, it's got the same sweetener in it as Ideal."
